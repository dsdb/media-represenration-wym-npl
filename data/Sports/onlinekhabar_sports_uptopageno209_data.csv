Tyson Moktan: The powerlifting pioneer in the country wants to pave the way for the future,"Saturday, July 15, 2023","Fitness has become a top priority for those considering health and well-being. It has gained immense popularity across all social media platforms, and fitness influencers have emerged as influential agents of change, motivating millions. And when it comes to fitness, Tyson Moktan is one of these influencers, as he has established himself as a trailblazing powerlifter in the country.
Starting as a passionate athlete and talented tennis player, Moktan has now become the country’s first professional powerlifter. He has achieved remarkable personal milestones and gained respect as a strength powerlifting coach. He has taken part in countless competitions in Nepal and abroad becoming one of to go to guys for powerlifting in the country.
Now, Moktan, who is a strength powerlifting coach at Ox Strength, wants to continue grooming young talents. Having successfully coached multiple national champions, his passion continues to drive him to support and nurture young talent. He firmly believes that by providing guidance and mentorship to emerging athletes, he can contribute to putting Nepal on the global map of powerlifting.
Tyson Moktan has been a highly competitive individual since his childhood. He embarked on his fitness journey at the age of 16 as he wanted to stay in shape. He was into sports from his childhood but gradually shifted to bodybuilding as he had a knack for it. As a year went by, he found his true passion – powerlifting.
“As I have been competitive all my life, I wanted an outlet to pursue a gym lifestyle, so I initially explored bodybuilding and men’s physique. However, in the end, I realised that powerlifting was the perfect fit for me,” he says.
Powerlifting is an extremely demanding form of fitness that requires immense dedication and effort. At the time when he started, Nepal had no professional powerlifters, but Moktan took it upon himself to pioneer the sport in the country.
“I conducted extensive research and received online coaching, which significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in powerlifting,” he says. However, finding suitable platforms for showcasing his talent was a challenge.
“When I ventured into powerlifting, it was still a relatively new concept in our country. I was searching for a competitive outlet and started participating in local competitions in Nepal,” he says.
Tyson Moktan has always made it a priority to stay updated with the latest information and technology in the fitness industry. He has crafted a routine that has remained consistent and rewarding since the beginning. His passion for the gym and the incredible outcomes it brings have made training an integral part of his life.
“My fitness routine has remained the same since the beginning. I don’t feel the need to change it because I love doing it passionately. I can’t go a few days without training. It has become a natural part of my progression,” he says.
Tyson Moktan’s first powerlifting competition in 2016 thrust him into the spotlight of the Nepali fitness industry. Following that, he became the first registered Crossfit L1 Trainer in Nepal and embarked on his coaching career.
One of Moktan’s most impactful moments occurred in late 2017 when he achieved a monumental lift of 250 kg, a weight that no one from Nepal had accomplished before. This achievement strengthened his belief in the power of determination and motivated him to train even harder.
“I felt like I could do anything if I put my mind to it. It was an incredible feeling of being on top of the world,” he says.
From that day forward, Tyson Moktan dedicated himself to becoming a top powerlifter. Understanding his end goals, creating sustainable plans, and trusting the process became the key pillars of his success.
Moktan has been a winner of the pump powerlifting meet open categories from 2016- 2018. In 2020, he also bagged the second position and set a national squat record with 245.5 kg during the Thailand National Championships U93.
He aspires to continue pushing the boundaries in the sport as an athlete himself while helping other athletes and fitness enthusiasts reach their full potential.
With his years of training, experience, education, and knowledge, Moktan has established Ox Strength to coach individuals virtually, aiming to achieve unimaginable goals.
Tyson Moktan places great emphasis on the importance of proper planning in one’s fitness journey. He believes that sustainable progress and dedication can be achieved by getting in the zone and following a well-thought-out plan.
“There is a quote that says, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail.’ I strongly adhere to that. As long as you have a sustainable plan and a clear understanding of your end goal, planning and taking one step at a time while trusting the process is all you need,” he says.
In a world where the lines can often be blurred by performance-enhancing drugs, Moktan firmly believes in maintaining a natural approach to fitness. He meticulously balances his diet and avoids relying on supplements, instead focusing on a wholesome approach to nutrition.
“There is a clear distinction between protein shakes and performance-enhancing substances. I believe in staying natural and considering supplements as a convenient form of food that helps complete my protein intake,” he says.
Reflecting on prevalent trends in the fitness industry, Moktan advocates for a discerning approach. While flashy movements may initially attract people to sports and fitness, he believes that true progress lies in sticking to the basics and understanding one’s journey.
Moktan strongly believes in delivering quality content that offers valuable information to his followers. He remains dedicated to his small yet loyal audience who seek his coaching expertise and support him wholeheartedly. He consciously chooses not to chase fleeting trends or prioritise being at the top of social media.
“I believe in sticking to the basics. I don’t force myself to follow the latest trends. Providing quality information and valuable tips is important to me. I have a small group of dedicated followers on social media, and that is what matters to us. We are not targeting a large audience who are just there for entertainment,” he says.
Tyson Moktan’s coaching extends beyond the realm of powerlifting, as he also assists individuals on weight loss journeys and helps athletes achieve multiple national records.
“Each client is unique, with different backgrounds, experiences, and challenges. Effective communication and understanding are crucial. I work closely with my clients to develop personalised training programs that ensure long-term success,” he says.
With his unwavering dedication, pioneering spirit, and commitment to sustainable training, Tyson Moktan continues to make a lasting impact in the world of strength sports and coaching.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tyson-moktan-nepal-fitness-influencer.html,sports

Aayush Kunwar aims to break a national record in Asian Athletics Championships,"Friday, July 7, 2023","Aayush Kunwar, 28, of Sanfebagar in Achham is excited. The six-foot-tall athlete will represent Nepal in the 100-200m events at the Asian Athletics Championships. The championship is scheduled from July 12 to July 16 in Bangkok. Along with Kunwar, six other Nepali athletes — Shiva Raj Parki, Som Bahadur Kumal, Mukesh Pal, Dipak Adhikari, Fulmati Rana and Raj Pura Pachhai — have also been selected for the championship.
Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Kunwar. In a conversation, he shared his expectation from the global championship, achievements, and challenges of athletes in Nepal among others.
Excerpt:
Is this your first international race?
Yes.
Could you share with us how it all happened?
I was called for a trial by the coaches for the selection of Asian Athletics. After the trial, coaches selected a group of athletes and I was also included in that selection.
Almost all athletes dream to represent their country in global competitions and it’s no exception for me. I had been trying for such an opportunity for a long time, and now the dream has finally come true.
How is the training session going?
The training is going well. Our practice begins at 7 am every day under the supervision of national coaches. We practice according to the category that we are selected for in the Asian Athletics Championships.
We engage in practice sessions at least three to four days a week, primarily focusing on running drills on the racing track. On the remaining days, we dedicate our training sessions to strength workouts at the gym.
Since it will be your first time in an international event, what are your expectations?
Realistically speaking, Nepal faces challenges in sprint events when compared to countries like China and Japan. However, as an athlete, I was to break the current national record of electronic time which is 10.71 seconds in the 100 metres and 21.95 seconds in the 200 metres. Since 1990 no one has beaten this record. I believe all the Nepali athletes participating in Asian Athletics Championships have a goal to beat the national record.
How did you get into athletics?
I have been a sports enthusiast since childhood. I was interested in football, table tennis and basketball and the base of every sport is athletics. In 2012, I was studying at Budhanilkantha School and I represented my school in the 200m and 400m races and the long jump in President Running Shield.
Getting a chance to run in Dasarath Rangasala was huge for me. I won gold medals in the 200m and 400m race and the long jump in the under 18 category. Likewise, I was also announced as the best athlete. Afterwards, members of departmental teams showed interest in me. This made me realise my potential and motivated me to continue athletics.
Tell us about your participation in a competition that is the most memorable and the achievements you have made to date.
In the 2018 National Games, I represented APF and won a gold medal in the relay race. I consider it as my biggest achievement to date. In the recently held National Games in Pokhara, I came fourth in the 100-metre race but in the 200-metre race unfortunately I couldn’t compete due to the hamstring. And now for the first time, I am representing Nepal on the global platform, which is also one of my biggest achievements.
Professionally you are a financial analyst, so how have you been managing time for athletics?
Actually, it is not that difficult. Most of the athletics events take place in the morning and after completing them I go to the office. My passion for sports or athletics also helps me to keep doing so. If you have a  passion you can take both sports and work simultaneously.
As an athlete what sorts of challenges have you faced so far?
The main challenge for Nepali athletes is the lack of exposure and sponsors. It is hard for athletes to get sponsors. Similarly, there is also a lack of competition within the country. If the athletes get sufficient exposure and chance to participate in the tournaments they can do much better. And lastly, the infrastructure for the athletes should also be upgraded.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/aayush-kunwar-sprinter-athletics.html,sports

Nepal end the SAFF Championship on a high as they beat Pakistan 1-0,"Wednesday, June 28, 2023","Bengaluru, June 28
The game was on a knife-edge at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru. Nepal were the better team but had nothing to show for it. Many had dubbed the game an exhibition and a dead rubber. But both Nepal and Pakistan wanted to end the SAFF Championship on a high.
There was tension in the stadium. Both were pushing to score but the lack of quality on both sides was evident. It was clear if the game was to have a winner, it would come through a moment of brilliance or a mistake.
Kiran Chemjong’s long clearance caused some chaos outside the Pakistan penalty area. The players were trying to clear the ball but it fell fortuitously on Ashish Chaudhary’s foot. Without thinking twice, Chaudhary hit the ball. It was not a convincing strike but the ball ended up in the back of the Pakistan net thanks to some uneven bounce as the boy who was working as a labourer in the southern plains of Nepal scored his first goal for the country and gave Nepal the lead.
Prior to that, Nepal had many chances. Bimal Gharti Magar missed a sitter as Nepal hit the crossbar and the post a couple of times. It was like the universe did not want Nepal to score. But Chaudhary had a different idea as he gave Nepal their only win in the 2023 SAFF Championship.
The moments following the goal were chaotic. Nepal had multiple chances to finish the game but lack of experience and quality meant the team could not take advantage of Pakistan going all in leaving gaps in defence.
This was Nepal’s first win against Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in 15 years. But the win did not come easy. Pakistan’s lack of chemistry was evident as they should have been put away by Nepal long before Chaudhary scored in the 80th minute.
This was Pakistan’s 12th loss in a row. Like Nepal, Pakistan had lost both its game in the SAFF Championship and were looking for a consolation win. But that was not to happen as the team once again performed below par and lost to an inexperienced Nepal
Nepal, however, have only positives to take from the tournament. Head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese said he was happy with the team’s performance. And he had every right to be, without time to prepare for the SAFF Championship, the team played quite well.
If you take away the first half against Kuwait, the team did all they could and come back rejuvenated as they hope to carry on the momentum in future competitions.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-end-saff-championship.html,sports
Shakti Gauchan is paving the way for the next generation to fulfil his test dream,"Wednesday, June 28, 2023","Shakti Gauchan, known for his gentle demeanour and infectious smile, dedicated 19 years to serving Nepal’s national cricket team. Gauchan retired from international cricket five years ago but his life still revolves around it.
His career has been a successful one. Along with Paras Khadka, Gauchan became a household name as he help take Nepal from the depths of Division 5 to gaining ODI status.
He had many highs during his career. Playing in the 2014 T20 World Cup was his greatest moment but what stands out for him is how the team received ODI status for the first time in 2018. But one dream eluded him as Nepal never got close to becoming a test nation.
“It is what it is,” says Gauchan.
But Shakti Gauchan has not given up on his dream. Gauchan, despite not playing a test, wants to pave the way for the coming generation as he hopes to see the country become a test nation in his lifetime.
Every time he was not with the national team, he would be at the New Horizon School in Butwal training students. He worked there for 20 years.
When being a cricketer was not as glorious as it is now, Gauchan was thankful to the school for employing him as a coach. The money he got from coaching kept his passion going and stopped him from giving up on cricket and leaving the country.
“I would have surely left,” says Gauchan as cricketing events were sporadic at the time.
Shakti Gauchan wanted to establish a cricket academy when he was playing. He knew it was important as that would help the country produce good players. Recognising the importance of starting early, Gauchan, in 2019, founded the Star Cricket Academy on his personal property in Omsatiya rural municipality, Rupandehi. There, he trains kids as young as 10 as he hopes to produce cricketers for the national team for years to come.
The academy features a dedicated training facility with nets, while the ground floor includes a hostel to accommodate players.
The Star Cricket Academy provides training to a group of 50 schoolchildren aged 10 and above. Among them, 25 students receive free training at an academy. With his vast experience, Gauchan possesses the ability to identify potential talents among these aspiring young players.
Asman Tharu, a 17-year-old from an economically disadvantaged background, is benefiting from free training at Star Cricket Academy.
“Sir (Gauchan) does not take fees from me and even provides bat,” says Tharu.
Having already participated in district-level competitions for his age category, Tharu is now dreaming to represent the national team in the future.
Like Tharu, Rahul Bhandari has also been receiving training at Star Cricket Academy for the last four years.
Bhandari says he has been inspired by players like Kushal Malla and Susan Bhari, who are products of Gauchan, as he wants to follow their steps and get into the national team.
The construction of an indoor hall has provided a convenient training space for players, ensuring uninterrupted practice even during rainy seasons and winter. Malla’s remarkable progress is attributed to the availability of this facility, and Gauchan takes immense pride and happiness in witnessing his development.
Spinner Sushan Bhari has emerged as a prominent player in domestic cricket, showcasing his talent and skills. Shakti Gauchan’s students have consistently displayed impressive performances, asserting their dominance in the age group team of Lumbini province. With their continuous progress, they are gradually carving out a significant place in the national team as well.
Binod Kunwar and his wife Sudikshya Gautam, successful entrepreneurs running a technology company in Sydney, Australia, and Nepal, have shown their unwavering support to Gauchan.
The two have taken a remarkable step by laying the foundation stone of Astrotech Oval, a cricket stadium in Tilottama. As part of their ambitious plan, they have entrusted Gauchan with the crucial responsibility of overseeing an academy that will accommodate 100 players with residential facilities.
“This academy can significantly help me to attain my dream,” says Gauchan.
Gauchan expresses that the day when Nepal achieves test status in cricket will hold a significance even greater than his participation in the World Cup.

SAFF Championship: Nepal and Pakistan both looking for a consolation win in a dead rubber,"Tuesday, June 27, 2023","Bangalore, June 27
The SAFF Championship has been a dream for Nepal’s football team and the millions of football fans in the country. Since 1993, Nepal has taken part in all SAFF Championships but has not won it a single time with their best finish coming in 2021 when it reached the final and lost to India.
This year, the team once again failed as they bowed out of the group stage after losing to Kuwait and India. But the team has a chance to end the tournament on a positive note as they take on Pakistan later today.
If the performance against Kuwait in the second half and India are to go by, Nepal has a great chance to finish the tournament with a consolation win in what many people are calling an exhibition match.
Nepal started the SAFF Championship timidly and were punished by Kuwait who proved too good for Nepal. Nepal’s loss in the game can be attributed to a lacklustre start in the first half. With the team only waking up in the last 15 minutes, the game was long lost by then.
Against India, things were different. The team played a solid game and even had chances to score. But as they did not take these chances, they were punished by Sunil Chhetri once again as they lost 2-0 and with it bowed out of the SAFF Championship.
Everyone knew the team was not ready to take on heavyweights like Kuwait, India and Lebanon in the SAFF Championship. The preparation was poor and the team lacked experience. But, just like in life, football held the promise of hope, only to have it mercilessly crushed early on.
“We have done well despite everything that has gone on in Nepali football over the last year,” said head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese. “We had one practice match before the tournament. If you give me one month with this team, things would have been different.”
Pakistan have not had the best tournament either. Making a comeback in SAFF Championship after their FIFA suspension, the team only arrived in India a few hours before their match against India. It was no surprise they were comfortably beaten by India and Kuwait.
Prior to the tournament, Pakistan played in the four-nations cup in Mauritius where they were beaten by the hosts, Kenya and Djibouti. The team has players playing in European leagues, but the performance is not been up to the level and Pakistan want to change that against Nepal.
In 2022, after their suspension was lifted, Pakistan took on Nepal in a friendly match and lost. So Pakistan will want to avenge that result. Nepal has also not beaten Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in over 15 years which a not a good omen for Nepal heading into the match today.
The two have played each other seven times and have won two games each with three ending in draws. Overall, the two teams have played each other 17 times with Nepal winning six, Pakistan winning five and six ending in draws.
Looking back at history and given how the two have performed, it is likely that this too will end in a stalemate.
Both teams are likely to make changes. Anjan Bista is injured and will miss out said Annese as he has hinted he will make more changes and ask his team to play an attacking style and be more fearless.
“We want to win and for that to happen, we need to be brave,” he said.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/saff-championship-nepal.html,sports

Kushal Bhurtel and Bhim Sharki did well to negate the opening hour but got out after getting in as Nepal were reduced to 66 for four.

In what was their second match against a test nation, Nepal won the toss and decided to bowl first. Like in the second match against the USA, Karan KC once again struck early as he sent Kyle Mayers in his first over. With the ball moving around a bit, the West Indies batters were very cautious as Johnson Charles was caught behind off the bowling of Gulshan Jha.

Sabitra Bhandari: South Asia’s best looking to take the Israeli league by storm,"Thursday, June 22, 2023","After a decade of hustle, Sabitra Bhandari, also known as Samba, has finally accomplished her long-cherished aspiration of playing for a European team. On June 13,  the 26-year-old signed to play for an Israeli club Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC in the Israeli Women’s League ‘Ligat Nashim’.
Bhandari is regarded as one of the top strikers in South Asia, and she will be the first-ever Nepali footballer to play in Europe.
Her aspirations go beyond merely playing as Bhandari wants to make a lasting impact in the league. She views the Israeli league as a stepping stone towards her ultimate goal of representing top-tier European clubs.
“I am excited to play in the league. I cannot express in words, how happy I am. But this is just the start,” she says.
Sabitra Bhandari developed a passion for football from a young age. Despite the modest circumstances, she would engage in the sport without owning proper footwear or a football. As the second child in a family of six siblings, she embraced her love for the game with limited resources.
“I remember playing barefoot with balls made out of socks,” he says.
As a woman whose main aim was to play football, Sabitra Bhandari faced numerous challenges along her journey. However, her unwavering dedication and relentless hard work propelled her forward. That was not all, Bhandari strongly believes that her parents played a pivotal role in shaping her current position.
“They always inspired me to play football,” she says.
She also thanks Sukra Tamang, a former ANFA referee, for introducing her to professional football.
Sabitra Bhandari’s footballing career started when she was signed up by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 2014 aged 18. Her performance at the club level soon got her a national team call up and since then Bhandari has not looked back.
She has been amazing scoring 43 goals in 41 games. Her performance in these games has been nothing short of extraordinary. But has faced some setbacks most notably tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in 2021 while playing in the Women’s National League.
“I could not play for a year. That made me very anxious as I spend days thinking if I could come back to football. But everything went well and here I am going to Israel,” she says.
During the recently concluded Indian Women’s League in May, Sabitra Bhandari showcased outstanding performance and emerged as the top scorer in the league. She feels playing in India has been integral to her getting signed up by an Israeli team as her dream to play in Europe is finally being fulfilled.
Sabitra Bhandrai’s performance in India had everyone in Nepal raving. Watching her showcase her talent there was the head coach of the men’s football team Vincenzo Alberto Annese.
Annese played a pivotal role in connecting Bhandari with an agent who has now provided her with an exciting opportunity to exhibit her talent in Israel.
“One day he called me and informed me that he has a friend who is an agent. He told me she could help me fulfil my dream of playing in a European league. I did not think twice and spoke to her,” says Bhandari.
Following their talk, the agent found Bhandari a club. But she views this accomplishment as the beginning of her journey as she is dreaming big.
“I want to play for the top clubs in the world. I will continue to work hard to fulfil that dream,” she says.
Sabitra Bhandari is not wasting time and has already started to train to play in the Israeli league. Committed as ever, she is following the practice schedule of Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC, immersing herself in the training regimen of the team so she can adapt quickly and make a mark in the league.
Hapoel Raanana was not the only team that approached her. She was approached by the league champions too, but she felt the project offered by Hapoel Raanana was best for her career.
The joy of Bhandari’s achievement extends beyond her personal fulfilment. Her teammates are equally happy for her are are celebrating her success.
“The younger players have been thanking me for opening an avenue to a European league,” says Bhandari. “The senior players are also equally positive, they have been motivating me for further growth.”
Another exciting development for Nepali football enthusiasts is that Nepal will be participating in the Asian Games for the very first time. This milestone presents a remarkable opportunity Sabitra Bhandri and the women’s team to test themselves against the best in Asia.
“I am excited for the Asian Games. We all area. It will give us good exposure. If we perform well, there will be more opporutinies for us,” she says.
Despite the Nepali women’s football team progressing remarkably, the concerned bodies have remained indifferent to its development. Nepal’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not organise regular tournaments which means new players hardly get chances to join the national team.
Apart from three departmental teams, Nepal does not have permanent women’s football clubs. This absence of dedicated clubs poses challenges in organising domestic leagues for women’s football in the country.
Sabitra Bhandari believes, addressing this gap and establishing more women’s football clubs could contribute to the growth of women’s football in Nepal.
“We have many good players who are waiting for a chance. If A Division clubs support us, we can take the women’s football team to new heights,” she says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sabitra-bhandari-israeli-women-league.html,sports

Kuwait dominated the first half and scored two goals thanks to Khaled Hajiah and Shabaib Al-Khaldi.

Defensive lapses did not help the team either.

Nepal then stepped up their game and put some pressure on Kuwait. The pressure counted as Anjan Bista scored his 12th goal for Nepal and became the third Nepali to score against Kuwait. The team tried but a lack of confidence upfront meant Nepal did not create enough chances to get back into the game.

SAFF Championship: Inexperienced Nepal looking to upset debutants Kuwait,"Wednesday, June 21, 2023","Bengaluru, June 21
Today, Nepal is set to face Kuwait in their opening match of the SAFF Championship at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru.
The Nepali team has arrived in Bengaluru with very little preparation with their new coach and a very inexperienced team.
Despite that, head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese up hopeful to bring a good result against tournament favourites Kuwait.
Speaking to Onlinekhabar on Tuesday, Annese said despite not having enough time to prepare for the tournament, the team was in good spirits ahead of their first game against Kuwait.
“We are fit and ready. Kuwait are a good team and we know it is going to be tough but we are ready for the challenge,” he said.
He feels the preparations would have been better if they had more time before the tournament. But with the league ending only 10 days ahead of the tournament, Annese could not prepare the team as he would have liked.
“The game against the Philippines was good practice for us. We took on them with only two days of training and did quite well. We had chances in the game. If we had 10 days before that game, we could have won I feel,” he says.
It has been a little over three months since Annese took over as the head coach. As the league season was ongoing at that time, he has not been able to spend much time with the national team. Despite that, he feels hopeful.
Annese did not say what his goals were for the SAFF Championship. But he did say he wants to start the tournament positively and hopes the team can play with his philosophy.
“My and the team’s main focus right now is Kuwait. We go one game at a time,” he said.
Nepal and Kuwait have been meeting regularly. Since 2019, the two have played five times with Kuwait winning four and drawing one.
In the nine total games the two have played against each other, Kuwait have won eight of them with their latest win coming in June 2022 during the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier where they beat Nepal 4-1.

Nepal beat the USA by six wickets in their second game of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier at Takashinga Sports Club in Harare on June 20.
Winning the toss, Nepal put the USA to bat and immediately reaped the rewards as Karan KC sent back Steven Taylor and Saiteja Mukkamalla in the second over of the game. The US batters struggled against KC’s precise line and length leaving them visibly uncomfortable throughout the opening hour of the match.
KC’s discipline proved too good as, the US’s stand-in captain, Aaron Jones and Nosthush Kenjige soon fell victim reducing the US to 18 for the loss of four wickets.
Gajanand Singh, centurion for the US against the West Indies, tried to take the game to the Nepali bowlers along with Sushant Modani but their 47-run stand was broken by Dipendra Singh Airee.
Shayan Jahangir played some positive strokes to settle the innings for the US. He took on all Nepali bowlers including Sandeep Lamichhane and Gulshan Jha and Aarif Sheikh as he scored an impressive 79-ball century. But with wickets falling at the other end regularly, Jahangir was left frustrated as the US were bowled out for 207 in 49 overs.
Karan KC was the pick of the bowlers as he took four wickets for 33 runs. Airee and Lalit Rajbanshi were also impressive as they held off an end. Airee took two wickets in five overs giving away only 15 runs while Rajbanshi took one wicket in 10 overs giving away only 20 runs. Jha finished the US’s tail as he took three wickets.
In reply, Nepali openers started where they left off in the first game against Zimbabwe as they attacked the US bowlers. But their attacking gameplay did not pay dividends and Saurabh Netravalkar trapped Aasif Sheikh and Nosthush Kenjige caught Kushal Bhurtel for 12 and 39 respectively.
But a mature innings from Bhim Sarki (77) and a late burst from Airee (39) took Nepal home giving the rhinos the first win of the ICC World Cup Qualifier.
Kenjige and Jessy Singh did trouble the Nepali batters but did not get the rewards thanks to some poor fielding from the team.

ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: Zimbabwe comprehensively beat Nepal by 8 wickets,"Sunday, June 18, 2023","Kathmandu, June 18
Hosts Zimbabwe comprehensively beat Nepal by eight wickets in the opening game of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier at Harare Sports Club on June 18.
Having been put to bat by the hosts, Nepal’s openers started the game in an attacking fashion. Kushal Bhurtel took the game to Zimbabwean bowlers attacking every loose delivery. On the other end, Aasif Sheikh played a composed inning as the opening pair put up 171 runs for the first wicket. Bhurtel was unlucky to miss out on a century as he was bowled by Wellington Masakadza for 99.  Sheikh soon followed Bhurtel into the dressing room after a well-made 66.
Despite such a great start, Nepal’s middle order could not capitalise. Despite a 72-run stand between Kushal Malla and Rohit Paudel, who scored 41 and 31 respectively, the team kept losing wickets at regular intervals as Nepal only managed to score 291 in 50 overs.
The score could have gone beyond 300 but Zimbabwe’s Richard Ngarava picked up four wickets to restrict Nepal to a par score.
In reply, Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts losing opener Joylord Gumbie early. But a solid partnership between captain Craig Ervine and Wessly Madhevere steadied the innings for the hosts as they put up 82 runs. Madhevere held out to Dipendra Singh Airee as he tried to take on a short delivery from Gulshan Jha.
But Ervine and Sean Williams carried the momentum forward putting up a 164-run stand and taking the hosts home with nearly six overs to spare. Ervine scored an impressive 128 ball 121 while Williams scored a blistering 102 of 70 balls.
Nepal’s bowling performance was below par, lacking the ability to build pressure, resulting in a comprehensive victory for the hosts.

An underdog’s rise to glory: Church Boys United’s remarkable rise from C Division to A Division Champions,"Friday, June 16, 2023","A footballer, Tanka Lal Rai aka Reuben, always dreamt of playing in the A Division League. However, despite his relentless efforts, he was unable to fulfil this aspiration. Undeterred by this setback, Rai channelled his passion for the sport and establish Church Boys United in 2009 with the goal of playing in the A Division League.
In 2010, when the team played the knockout tournament to get into the C Division for the first time, Rai captained the team himself. But he found out how tough the road was to get into the C Division and make their way to the top.
It took Church Boys United nearly a decade to get into the C Division but when they did, the club made the most of it.
In their debut season in the C Division in 2021, Church Boys United made an impressive mark by clinching the title. The following season, they continued their fine form and won the B Division in 2022.
Many had felt the team would not be able to continue this trend, but defying the odds, the newly promoted side won the A Division League with one game to spare.
With the unwavering commitment of its players and the relentless efforts of the team management, Church Boys United achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the second team, alongside Manang Marshyangdi Club, to win all three Divisions in their first attempts. This remarkable accomplishment showcases the team’s exceptional performance and solidifies their place in Nepali football history.
“After 15 years of struggle, we have attained this dream. I can’t express this moment in words,” says Rai, president of Church Boys United.
When Church Boys United became champion of the B Division they did not have a single marquee player. Not wanting to disrupt the team had done so well, they kept hold of 12 players including their star player Ashish Chaudhary. But to take on heavyweights of Nepali football, the club brought in 16 players including Anjan Bista, Ananta Tamang, Tej Tamang, Dinesh Rajbanshi, Arik Bista and Kamal Shrestha.
“I was confident about the squad. The team had the potential to win the league. So, I decided to join the team,” says club captain Ananta Tamang.
Prior to the commencement of the league, Church Boys United faced setbacks as key players Dinesh Rajbanshi and Tej Tamang departed for Australia. Bista also went to India to take part in the I Leauge. The absence of these players hindered the team during the initial matches. Simultaneously, the team faced another setback as Nepali American coach Pradip Humagain stepped down from his position due to challenges in acquiring a work permit.
Bista joined the team on Matchday 6 while on Matchday 7, the team played without a coach. Bal Gopal Maharjan joined the team on Matchday 8 and did not have the best of starts winning one, drawing two and losing two.
The team experienced a turning point on Matchday 13 when they faced Manang Marsyangdi Club. In a resounding victory, they defeated MMC 3-0, which significantly boosted their confidence.
“It gave us the belief that we could take on anyone,” said Bista.
Since then one, the team did not look back winning eight of the 13 matches to become champions of Nepal.
Maharjan feels this title was a result of hard work and feels extremely proud of having won it with Bista and Tamang who he has coached since they were teenagers.
During the post-match conference, he sat between them and proudly acknowledged the entire team for their victory, singling out specific individuals for their exceptional contributions.
The club’s President, Rai, attributes the team’s victory to strong leadership and acknowledges the significant roles played by players like Bista and Tamang in achieving success.
“The leadership quality in the field made our team successful,” says Rai, pointing to Tamang, “Furthermore, we were also very strict about discipline. We were successful in maintaining the team’s unity. Foreign players also played well, according to their capacity.”
Bista expressed his gratitude towards his teammates, team management, and coach, emphasising the strong bond they shared as a family.
“Our unity played a crucial role in securing the victory,” he says.
Winning the A Division is not only a matter of becoming a national champion but also presents clubs with an exciting opportunity to participate in an international tournament.
The league champion earns the privilege of representing Nepal in the AFC Cup, a prestigious tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation that brings together league champions from across Asia.
But Church Boys United will not be able to take part in the count competition as they do not have an AFC licence. In Nepal, only Machhindra Football Club, Tribhuvan Army Club and Armed Police Force have the AFC licence. As Church Boys United do not have the licence, Machhindra, who finished second in the league, will play in the AFC Cup.
The players of Church Boys United express their disappointment regarding the missed opportunity to participate in the AFC Cup.
“We have lost the opportunity to introduce the Church Boys United to the international stage,” says Tamang.
Bista was informed about this during the league, which came as a surprise to him.
“We put in a lot of effort, but some other team will get to take part in the tournament that we should have been able to take part in,” he said.
However, the club’s President, Rai, remains optimistic and states that the club will work towards obtaining the AFC licence so this does not happen again.

2 ultra runners from Karnali dream of UTMB,"Thursday, June 15, 2023","On May 29, Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar, participated in the Tenzing Hillary Everest Marathon, one of the toughest marathons in the world, for the first time. But when the two sprinted ahead of the pack, no one could tell if this was the first time the two were running a high-altitude marathon in their career.
Leaving Jumla, Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar just wanted to have fun and compete in the famous race. But Kunwar finished second in the male category finishing the race in under four hours while Rawot finish first in the female category finishing the race in 5 hours and 25 minutes shocking everyone, even themselves.
So how did the two manage to perform so impressively in the marathon? The answer lies in their training, hard work and determination.
Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar are products of Karanali Sports Club, established by Hari Bahadur Rokaya, one of Nepal’s best marathon runners. This club has a notable track record of nurturing talented athletes like Sunmaya Budha, who has been participating in numerous races internationally and consistently securing podium finishes.
Here the two learnt pace, timing, diet and endurance. In addition, both of them acquired additional running skills, which developed their ability to compete against the country’s top athletes.
The guidance and training provided by their mentor Rokaya in the remote high-altitude regions of Karnali province gave them an advantage, which was evident during the Everest marathon.
Despite struggling with altitude sickness and fatigue, they two showed everyone what a positive mindset can do when it comes to running in the Himalayas.
“The training there is rigorous and we can’t thank the club enough,” says Kunwar.
At the club, they engage in two types of training sessions, six days a week from Monday to Saturday. One focuses on pacing while the other focuses on distance covering. During the pacing sessions, they would run 20 kilometres on the track, while the distance-covering sessions involved running on trails in the hills and forests.
“We run five hours every Saturday and get Sundays off,” says Rawot.
Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar career trajectory, however, has been different. Rawot, 21, started running as early as 13, while Kunwar only started running a year ago.
Rawot caught people’s eyes after creating a national record in the President’s Running Sheild. Soon she was training under Rokaya. She trained with the club until she was in school after which she stopped to get a job and take care of her family.
“It is hard as a girl. Society talks a lot when we do what we love. They said that as a girl, I had to follow the norms of the society. I did not want my family to be disrespected so I started to look for jobs to help my family,” says Rawot.
But she knew she was made for running and after a hiatus of a few years, Rawot made a comeback last year at the Jumla Rara Ultra Marathon.
“Running is in my blood. Winning the ultra marathon made me believe in my ability once again,” she says.
Like Rawot, Kunwar, 22, was also born to run. Despite starting his running career just a year ago, Kunwar has already participated in and won several marathons. He achieved podium finishes in races like Jumla-Rara Ultra Marathon, Guerrilla Ultra Trail Race, Pokhara Fishtail Marathon, and many more.
Kunwar wanted to join the Nepal Army and even attempted the trials two years ago. While he successfully cleared all the physical tests with ease, unfortunately, he did not pass the written exam.
Disappointed in not being able to get into the Nepal Army, he also ran the Jumla Trail Marathon in July 2022 finishing second. That for him became a turning point as he has not looked back since.
“I ran for fun and came in second. I then wanted to test myself and joined the Karnali Sports Club,” says Kunwar.

Despite facing numerous challenges, the Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar from Karnali have achieved remarkable success, bringing pride to both Karnali province and their club, Karnali Sports Club. Their accomplishments stand as evidence that individuals can excel in sports and become leaders, even when hailing from underdeveloped regions with limited infrastructure and practice opportunities.
Rawot expresses gratitude to her family, acknowledging that without their support, she would not have reached this point in her athletic journey.
“They told me to do what I love. I am thankful to them,” she says.
Kunwar too feels that family support is integral to their success along with the role of the Karnali Sports Club.
“This is a team effort,” he says.
Now Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar want to take a leap out of Sunmaya’s book and compete in races abroad. They feel they are ready and given how they have been able to do so with limited exposure and resources, the two feel if they get the right kind of support, they can participate and even win these races.
“Our goal is the UTMB. If we continue to work hard, I believe we can do it and maybe one day win a major race and make Nepal proud,” says Rawot.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/manju-rawot-and-dal-bahadur-kunwar.html,sports
Nepal’s mighty libero: Salina Shrestha’s unmatched tenacity in Nepali women’s volleyball,"Wednesday, June 14, 2023","Salina Shrestha, the volleyball player, always stands out when she steps onto the court. As a libero, she wears a distinct jersey and standing at just 4 feet 9 inches tall, she is noticeably shorter than most of her fellow players which sets her apart from others on the team.
Despite the generally perceived benefits of height in volleyball, Salina Shrestha has proven that it does not hinder her performance. She has been involved with the national volleyball team for five years and in that time has won two titles, showcasing what hard work and resilience can do for a player.
She was key to Nepal winning the silver medal at the 13th South Asian Games. Her performance during the recently concluded CAVA Women’s Challenge Cup Volleyball was of note too as she was dubbed the best libero showing how far she’s come in her career.
Now, Salina Shrestha wants to continue to improve in her craft as she hopes to end her career with a few more international titles to her name.
This was not the first time she has been awarded the best libero as she won it during the CAVA Senior Women’s Central Zone Volleyball Competition in 2021. While her earlier achievement showcased her talent, this particular award on home soil added a deeper level of significance for her.
“I feel proud. There were some great women and being called the best of all of them is a great feeling,” she says.
Not winning the title, however, has left a bad taste for her as there were high expectations going into the tournament given Nepal were defending champions. This year’s competition proved to be challenging, primarily due to the presence of two formidable teams—India and Kazakhstan. The strong presence of these teams added to the intensity of the competition, making it a tough battle for Nepal to defend their title.
“We gave it our best. It does not feel good to lose but we are proud of ourselves,” she says.
The tournament was tough for Nepal but the team showed significant improvements primarily in defence which had been the team’s Achilles heel.
“We can still improve our defence and get better at blocking and even serving,” she says pointing out areas where the team can focus on to become even more formidable in these aspects of the game.
One thing the team lacked during this tournament was practice. The team had a new coach in Belgian Jan De Brandt. But in the three months that he was with the team, they did not play a single practice match before the tournament.
Despite that, Nepal easily defeated Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh in their first two games but lost to rivals India in the final group game which showed where the team really stood.
“We played a good game against India but lost key points. The coach made us believe in ourselves and that showed in the game against India. We cannot wait for the Asian Games,” she said.
Salina Shrestha has dedicated 14 years of her life to playing volleyball. Her contribution in establishing New Diamond Club as a dominant force in Nepali women’s volleyball has been instrumental. Her skills and leadership played a significant role in the club’s success and rise to prominence in the sport.
Her leadership took the team to a new height as it soon became one of the most liked teams in Nepal. They were so good, they even gave departmental teams like Nepal Police and Nepal Army a run for their money.
Her journey into the national team, however, was not as straightforward.
Despite consistently performing well in domestic volleyball, Salina Shrestha had to wait a lot to represent the national team. The disappointment of not being able to secure a spot on the team weighed heavily on her, especially after being called to training camps for the selection of the South Asian Games in 2016 and the World Championship the following year. The emotional impact of these experiences affected Shrestha deeply as she wanted to test herself at the highest level.
From 2013 to 2016, Shrestha’s defensive skills consistently left everyone in awe. Whether it was her remarkable technique, agility, or unwavering determination, her defence was all people in volleyball talked about.
“Salina was like a robot,” says Kumar Rai, coach of New Diamond Club.
After experiencing disappointment from being left out of the national team, she finally got a deserved call-up in 2019. The team was quite balanced too and Shrestha feels lucky to be a part of the team that won an international title and came in second in the South Asian Games.
The national women’s volleyball team underwent several changes in 2019 for the CAVA Central Zone Senior Women’s Volleyball Competition. The tournament provided an opportunity for many young players to showcase their talents and represent the team including Shrestha. And she did not disappoint as she stood out as the sole libero during the Central Zone Volleyball Competition held in Bangladesh in 2019.
“I was nervous at first but later after entering court everything felt right,” she says.
After a four-year wait, Salina Shrestha finally had the chance to prove herself on the international stage. That also coincided with Nepal winning their first international competition which also earned her a permanent place in the team.
Since joining the national team four years ago, Salina Shrestha has established herself as a prominent libero in Nepali women’s volleyball. Throughout this time, she has not been challenged. Shrestha’s abilities and consistent performances have solidified her status as a standout player in her position, making her an unrivalled presence in Nepali women’s volleyball when it comes to the libero role.

Unprepared Nepal brace for challenging SAFF Championship campaign,"Tuesday, June 13, 2023","Nepal’s national football team has left for the Philippines to play a friendly match before heading to Banglore, India to take part in the SAFF Championship.
In previous years, the team has always approached the tournament aiming to win it. However, this year things are different.
Despite being the former runner-up, the football team has no goal. With a team seeing a sea of change, it is almost certain the team will have a hard time during the tournament.
The inability to establish themselves as a strong contender in the South Asian region can be attributed to three primary reasons.
In the past year, a large number of players have migrated abroad. While the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not have official data, it is estimated that around 80 to 90 national team players have left the country for a better future abroad.
This affected the recently concluded A Division League but its greater impact is on the national football team as it disrupted the balance within the team which was reflected in their performance during the Prime Minister Three Nations Cup held in Kathmandu in April.
Nepal needing a last-minute goal to draw with Bhutan was a testament to how far off the team has come since the last SAFF Championship when it reached the final for the very first time.
Captain Kiran Chemjong got emotional when ask about the increasing exodus of players during the farewell program held for the team on June 11. He expressed his sadness over how players felt compelled to leave the country as they saw no future in football.
“Players leaving in the middle of the league season is disheartening to see. When I hear news of friends I’ve played with for so long leaving, it pains me. I often ask what the future holds for me,” he said.
He says it was about time the government and relevant sporting bodies did something to address this issue.
“If not, more will go and what happens to the national team then,” he said.
The SAFF Championship starts on June 21. But the team only started preparing for the biggest football tournament in South Asia on June 11. Prior to the tournament, the team will play one friendly match against the Philippines before taking on India, Kuwait and Pakistan in the group games.
Due to the delayed conclusion of the league on June 10, the head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese faced challenges in organising a training camp for the national team for the SAFF Championship. The lack of planning from ANFA and the reluctance of A Division Clubs to release players further hindered his efforts to execute his plans effectively.
Teams usually need a month of training before taking part in a major tournament. However, Nepal’s team will have gotten together a week before the tournament with only one friendly match under their belt. In addition, with the team relatively new, Chemjong understands it will be challenging.
“It is going to be hard. We have had no time to understand each other’s game so I cannot say what will happen in the SAFF Championship,” he said.
In a bid to improve the quality of the SAFF Championship, the federation invited two teams from the Gulf region Lebanon and Kuwait. While this move is expected to elevate the overall level of competition, it has also pushed Nepal’s title aspirations further away, considering their inadequate preparation for the tournament.
The South Asian teams will face tough opponents in Lebanon, ranked 99th in the FIFA rankings, and Kuwait, ranked 143rd. Considering that Nepal have not beaten India since 2013, the team beating Kuwait and a changed Pakistan in the group stage is highly unlikely.
“The tournament as a whole is going to be great thanks to Lebanon and Kuwait. We have not had the best of preparations but we will give our all,” said Chemjong.

Ram Krishna Maharjan: Meet Nepal’s only runner to have completed Six Star World Marathon Majors,"Monday, May 29, 2023","On a cold damp afternoon in April 2023 in London, Ram Krishna Maharjan, 66, was running the most notable race of his long career. Having already finished five Major Marathons in the world after he turned 50, the London Marathon was the only one remaining from the Six Star World Marathon Majors.
Prior to running it, he had issues with his leg and was not 100 per cent fit. His training was not complete, but in his mind, he was ready. So on a damp afternoon, he ran the race and in 3 hours and 32 minutes, completed it and became the only Nepali citizen to complete the Six Star World Marathon Majors.
“This had been a challenge I set to myself after I turned 50 and having achieved it gives me a lot of pride,” says Maharjan.
Ram Krishna Maharjan’s road to finishing the London Marathon has been a long one. After turning 50, he has run nearly 50 races finishing each one. He has endured a lot in those years, including self-doubt, but the veteran runner continued to push boundaries and run for the sheer love of it.
Now, with the Six Star World Marathon Majors over, he aims to continue to run and become the only Nepali to run a marathon on all six continents and in doing so inspire a young breed of runners in the country.
Ram Krishna Maharjan started running around 1969 when he saw a bunch of foreigners running around Thamel. Curious, he started to run with them and after that, there was no looking back. He was only 13 at the time and after running with a group of officials from the US Embassy, he started to get a feel for running and asking his cousins to join him.
After running for fun, Maharjan started taking part in races in school. He loved running long distances and started to take part in 800 and 1,500-metre races.
“I found it comfortable in these races. I won man of these races too, which gave me the confidence to push on.”
By the time Ram Krishna Maharjan was in his late teens, he started to take part in every event out there. When he was 20, he even took part in his first half-marathon in Kathmandu and came in second. That gave him the belief that he could continue and the podium finish caught the eyes of athletics coaches in the Kathmandu valley like Laxman Bikram Shah and Madhu Samsher Rana. There he also met long-distance runner Baikuntha Manandhar.
“Training with them was important for me. I learnt a lot about training and conserving energy and when to push hard.”
With races in Nepal being a rarity back then, joining Manandhar and others in training exposed Ram Krishna Maharjan to international races. In 1979, he got his first chance at one when he went to India to take part in the Darjeeling District Marathon. Finishing second in the race gave him added confidence and two years later, he was in Moscow taking part in a 1,500-metre race.
After that, he had to look after his family and running full-time was not going to be feasible. He continued to run races and marathons when he could, but his priorities changed.
He had joined the Nepal Army, but left after two years. He worked different jobs in Nepal and went to Japan. In Japan, he learnt a lot from runners there. He started to learn about the importance of diet and rest and decided to work differently to run marathons in his 40s.
In 2002, Ram Krishna Maharjan ran his first half marathon in Japan. The following year, he ran the Malaysia Open Championship, in which he won the gold. He still recalls how challenging it was.
Unlike Nepal, there were over a thousand runners and that shook him, but that did not deter him as he gave his best. His most active years were in the 2000s when he took part in races across Asia. Those races were just the beginning of what he really wanted to do – run the Six Star World Marathon Majors.
The first came in the form of the Boston Marathon in 2008. Ram Krishna Maharjan was 51 by then, and he knew it was not going to be easy. But he had trained a lot for it. Prior to the marathon, he ran around 140 kilometres every week. This included two days of intense running to develop muscle memory when he ran the marathon.
“The training was important. I still do that today to train for marathons because it prepares me for what is to come.”
He finished the marathon in under three hours and started to think about his next challenge, the Tokyo Marathon. He ran it in 2009 and finished in 628th position.
“I started to believe I could do all the major marathons.”
In 2011, Ram Krishna Maharjan was back in the US as he ran the New York Marathon. This was of the best runs of his career as he finished the race in 2 hours 51 minutes, finishing in 16th place in his category. He followed that with an even better performance at the Chicago Marathon in 2013 as he finished in 11th position in his category.
“These finishes were a result of my hard work and determination. These two races in the US were very important to me.”
Only two races from the Six Star World Marathon Major remained, but he decided to run other races to test himself and in doing so travel the world. He went to Canada and Australia to run marathons there.
“Covid did not help either as most races stopped taking place.”
In 2022, Ram Krishna Maharjan went to Germany to run the Berlin Marathon. That was, he says, his hardest run. Prior to leaving for Germany, he had contracted dengue and was sick. But he had planned everything and wanted to run the race desperately.
“Breathing was hard, but I pushed hard to complete it.”
He feels he running these six marathons in the world along with various others is a measure to test himself at the biggest stage. It also gives him a chance to travel the world and meet people from different walks of life.
“If my running will inspire people, I will continue to do this. A lot of people have helped me in my journey by giving me a place in their homes and I will be forever thankful to them.”
And Ram Krishna Maharjan has inspired many people. He says he tells people to run for the love of it and not to win medals. He feels currently many people chose not to run marathons in Nepal as they believe a handful of people from the Nepal Army or the Nepal Police will win. But he says that is a wrong mindset.
“When I ran, Baikuntha won almost all races. I never gave up and trained, but he still won. But that did not mean I stopped running. I continued to train and beat him twice. I did not train just to win medals, I trained because I wanted to get better as a runner,” he said.
Ram Krishna Maharjan feels it is important to lose as adversities are important to build mental strength, which is as important as physical strength in sports.
But now, he runs just to have fun. As he has achieved his goal of running Major Marathons, he now wants to run marathons on each continent.
“I want to go to South America and Africa. I do not know how I will get there, but hopefully, the universe conspires for me to get there.”

Know all about 6 Nepali players shining on international fields,"Sunday, May 21, 2023","The number of players in various sports is rising in Nepal. Despite the social and financial challenges, there is a remarkable charm in becoming a player among the Nepali youth.

He is the first Nepali player snapped up at the IPL auction, fetching a bid of INR 2 million.
Nepal’s national women’s football team’s striker Sabitra Bhandari, also known as Samba, currently plays for Gokulam Kerala in the Indian Women’s League (IWL). In Indian women’s football, this Nepali player is popularly known as a goal machine. In the current season of the IWL being held in Gujarat, Bhandari has already scored 26 goals in eight matches.
In 2018-19 and in 2019-20, she was a part of the IWL winning teams: Sethu FC and Gokulam Kerala respectively.
Bhandari is also the highest goal scorer in Nepali women’s football history.
The captain of the Nepal national football team, goalkeeper Kiran Chemjong has played for several international football clubs and won various titles. Recently, this Nepali player played for RoundGlass Punjab FC of India in the I-League, India’s major football league. Chemjong is a two-time I-League champion. In 2017-18, representing Minerva Punjab, he won the league. Similarly, in 2022-23 as well, he won the league representing RoundGlass Punjab.
Some other foreign clubs he has played for include Maziya S&RC and TC Sports Club of Maldives. From both clubs, he has the Dhivehi Premier League. In both leagues, he was announced the best goalkeeper.
Nepali player Rohit Chand has become a part of several international football clubs. Currently, he plays for the Indonesian club Persik Kediri in the top tier of the Indonesian league. Prior to that, he played for Persija Jakarta for five years. As a part of Persija Jakarta, he has won various tournaments including League 1, Indonesia President’s Cup and Menpora Cup.

"Player safety: Nepali football pays the price for ANFA, club apathy","Thursday, May 18, 2023","Two days after Nepal beat Laos to win the Prime Ministers’ Three Nations Cup on March 31, almost all national teams players were back with their respective A Divison Clubs.
Since then, these players have played 12 matches in less than two months with a two-day break between them. And, the effects are showing as players, both Nepali and international, are going down injured one after another.
Bimal Gharti Magar was ruled out of the Three Nations Cup in March due to an injury. On May 7, he twisted his ankle, leaving himself doubtful for the SAFF Championship that will be held in Bengaluru, India, in July. He is not the only one; players like Arik Bista and Bikas Khawas are also doubtful for the tournament as questions are being raised if the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and A Division clubs care about player safety.
Looking at the way things are going, it is clear ANFA is in a rush to finish the league notwithstanding any incidents related to player safety. If nothing happens between now and the last match, the league will have been finished in three months. During this time, each team would have played 26 games in three months. This happens nowhere.
“No one cares about the player safety in this country. ANFA wants to finish it as fast as it can and clubs want to save as much money as they can. The players in all of this are never thought about,” says Three Star Club coach Megh Raj KC.
Due to the tight schedule, over a dozen players have been injured. The remaining players on the field are dealing with a few niggles as many players are playing through pain.
All of the player safety-related issues could have been avoided had the league started in November 2022. But due to tension between ANFA and clubs, the league moved back almost three months. ANFA has not been able to act as an authority as it owes all clubs preparation money it promised it would provide.
Defending champions Machhindra FC have been ravaged by injuries. The team, hit by key players leaving for Australia, suffered more as their marquee signing Chencho Gyeltshen suffered a foot injury after playing only seven games. The team also lost Indian defender Dayananda Singh in an injury and are now playing without key forward Bimal Gharti Magar. A number of players in the club have fallen sick due to a lack of rest, say club sources.
When Machhindra lost 2-1 to Church Boys on Matchday 16, captain and goalkeeper Bishal Shrestha did not play as he had a fever. Coach Kishor KC after the match said Shrestha was feeling the effects of continuous games.
“There is no time for these players to recover. I will not be surprised if more players are injured,” says KC.
After talks failed to start the league in November 2022, ANFA then planned to start the A Division league in early January. But clubs refused the idea stating the preparation time was not enough. The clubs did not agree with ANFA’s plan to start it in February complaining they did not receive preparation money. ANFA has been giving clubs Rs 3.2 million to prepare for the league campaign.
In a bid to please clubs, the league campaign only started on March 3. Many questioned why the league was being held when ANFA did not have the funds to conduct it and the governing body to this day does not have a title sponsor for the league.
Tournament director Sanjeev Mishra says he warned the clubs the league would be very difficult to run from the proposed date and player safety-related risks would be high. But the clubs did not listen to him.
Why? Because the longer the league season went on, the clubs would have to pay players more. Hence, they were in favour of the league taking place in a short duration.
“If the teams had had 40/45 players, the scenario would have been different but as they only have 30 players and when key players go down, then they are faced with major issues,” says Mishra.
Why are clubs in such a strong position? It is because ANFA cannot do anything by bypassing these clubs. Nor can they enforce any player safety rule on them as they need the clubs to hold a successful tournament.
Most of these clubs are community-based and are exclusively based in Kathmandu. ANFA has been stating it wants to bring clubs from outside Kathmandu but has done nothing towards that.
“It is impossible to make everyone happy. I feel ANFA should work towards strictly implementing player safety rules that have been made to help league football,” says Mishra.
Coach Megh Raj KC also thinks it was high time ANFA developed a yearly football calendar and implement it strictly. If it does that, what happened this year will not repeat.
“They should do that. But will they? I don’t think so,” says KC.
Mishra claims he has been drafting a yearly calendar and sending it to ANFA’s secretariat but it has not been implemented.
The league is ending on June 10. Five days after that, Nepal will take on the Philippines in a friendly before they go to India to take part in the SAFF Championship.
Members of the national team will play 10 league games next month. It is clear that before the SAFF Championship, they will be fatigued. And with many players injured and a large number leaving for Australia before the league started, the tournament will be very tough for new coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese.
Nepal have never won the SAFF Championship. The team, however, did reach the final for the first time in 2021 losing to India 3-0. But things have changed since then as 10 members of the squad are not there anymore. That means it will be a mammoth task for Annese as he will have to go through India and Lebanon who have qualified for the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar.
“It would have been better if the league was halted to help the national team prepare for the SAFF Championships. ANFA was not strong enough to make the decision and clubs did not want to spend more money on the league,” says KC.
Even Bal Gopal Maharjan, who has managed the national team and its different age groups, feels the players are being put through too much, and it cannot be justified from the player safety.
“I know every club is struggling financially, but we need to think about player safety because, at this rate, they will be burnt out,” he says. “Players have left the country and with one after another getting injured, the national team will struggle.”
Mishra also feels the team will struggle in the SAFF Championship. But he understands ANFA’s hands are tied from implementing player safety rules.
“ANFA cannot tell clubs not to play national team players. Clubs will do what is best for them,” says Mishra.
Physiotherapist Suraj Bhusal, who worked in Nepali football for over a decade, says all stakeholders including the players should be equally responsible for reducing the risk of injury and promoting player safety.
From keeping themselves fit, the players should pay attention to the preparations before the competition while it is the responsibility of the relevant football association to determine the schedule so that the players are comfortable. Clubs can also reduce the load of players by signing enough players in the team, he says.
“Injuries can happen anytime and in any circumstances. We have to look at it broadly,” says Bhusal.
But the league is taking place on three grounds in Kathmandu and all of them are different from each other.  While Chyasal and Dasharath Stadium are similar, ANFA Complex has an AstroTurf which is completely different from the player safety perspective.
Bhusal also points to how games are being played with only one day’s gap.
“FIFA rules state a gap between two games should be 48 to 72 hours, but here, we are playing games within 24 hours. No medical personnel were spoken to when making the fixture list,” says Bhusal, who is not surprised players are injured and fatigued.
However, due to access to new media, players themselves are aware of injuries and other player safety-related issues and how to prevent them. But in Nepal, they disregard this and play with injuries as they do not have other means of making a living. This, Bhusal says, is risking long-term injuries.

Amir Akhtar withdraws case against CAN; EPL will return now,"Wednesday, May 17, 2023","Kathmandu, May 17
Everest Premier League (EPL) promoter Amir Akhtar has withdrawn the case filed at the Supreme Court against the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).
Akhtar filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court on May 22, 2022, saying that CAN had entered into an illegal agreement with the Indian company Seven3Sports while organising the controversial Nepal T20 League.
“After CAN scraped its contract with Seven3Sports and told us we could hold EPL as we did previously, we decided to withdraw the case,” said Akhtar. “Our fight is over.”
Akhtar said CAN is allowing his company to conduct the EPL. Akhtar informed his team will now prepare for the EPL by looking at the national team’s international schedule.
“We are open to the EPL taking place, but how and in which modality will it take place is yet to be decided. We will discuss the player salaries, modality of the league, foreign players and other issues again,” said CAN president Chatur Bahadur Chand.

"Women’s football: As Nepali players shine in India, ANFA pays them lip service","Monday, May 15, 2023","Sabitra Bhandari from Nepal is lighting up the Indian Women’s League (IWL). In seven, Bhandari, who is also known as Samba, has scored 26 goals including five hat-tricks (one seven-goal game) for Gokulam Kerala FC.
With the team yet to play more games, it is likely that her goal tally will significantly go up as Bhandari, after being the highest scorer in Nepali women’s football, has created history and has become the all-time leading goal scorer in the IWL.
Players like Bhandari shining in foreign leagues in South Asia is good for Nepali players and Nepali football. It allows them to test themselves with the best.
That said, these players are sad that women’s football has not developed in the country as the football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), has not been able to conduct a women’s league this year. This means national team players who do not get the opportunity to play abroad have to wait a long time to play tournaments in the country.
Things in countries like India and Bangladesh are different. A women’s league is being held in India regularly while Bangladesh recently announced Asia’s first women’s franchise football league. The league is set to start in May, in which players from Asia and all over the world are due to take part.
When it comes to women’s football, India is South Asia’s powerhouse. Recently, Bangladesh are also on the up as they won the SAFF Women’s Championship for the first time by defeating both India and Nepal.
Nepal, on the other hand, are yet to win the title. But the women who play are not to blame for this as preparations only start on the eve of the tournament. This has left many players disappointed as they believe they could do a lot better in these tournaments if there was a proper domestic structure and a national league.
Nepal’s national women’s football team midfielder Renuka Nagarkoti is excited to play in India. But she feels Nepal is not doing enough for the women’s game.
“Nepal not having a domestic league is sad for women’s football. But it gives me a lot of pride to play in India,” says Nagarkoti, who plays for Kickstart FC Karnataka.
She believes if there is a regular league in Nepal, players will get exposure and new players will also get opportunities, resulting in a strong national team.
Like Nagarkoti, Saru Limbu, Rekha Paudel and Anjila Tumbapo Subba, who are also playing in the Indian Women’s League for the first time, are also excited.
Six players from Nepal are participating in the Indian Women’s League. Bhandari is playing for defending champions Gokulam Kerala while Subba is playing for Sethu FC.
Similarly, Nagarkoti and Limbu are playing for Kickstart FC and Paudel is playing for Sports Odisha. Anita Basnet is playing for the new team, Lord’s FA Kochi. Except for Nagarkoti and Basnet, all the players are first-team regulars.
Bhandari has become a goal machine this year as even India’s best players fall behind her. This proves Bhandari is a star player not only in Nepal but also in South Asia.
She has been unstoppable as she has scored four goals each in three games, five and seven goals in one game each and two in another taking her total to 19 goals in six games. She has only failed to score in one game in the IWL this year, which ended in a goalless draw for her team.
Subba has been solid in goal as she has kept five clean sheets in six games. It is safe to say that Nepali women are doing great in the IWL. It is likely all Nepalis will play in the quarter-finals of the IWL which will have four teams from each group. The quarterfinalist will also qualify directly for the next women’s league.
It is clear India are miles ahead of Nepal when it comes to both men’s and women’s football. While the Indian Super League has been going on quite well, the country has started organising a league tournament for women, in which players from other countries can take part. But in Nepal, women’s football has always been under the shadows as ANFA could not even complete the league that was once announced.
In 2021, ANFA conducted the National Women’s League in a double round-robin system with seven teams. Players from India and Africa took part in the league, which was seen as a positive step in women’s football in the country. But in 2022, things took an ugly turn after ANFA could hot host the second round of the league.
The decision to hold the second round of the league in Biratnagar was made by former ANFA president Karma Tsering Sherpa, but when Pankaj Bikram Nembang was elected the new president, things did not move forward.
Nembang’s team said it would host the event after the SAFF Women’s Championship, but it did not and ANFA announced the winner based on the points of the first round.
The Armed Police Force team were declared the champions as they had won all seven games while Nepal Police Club finished second and Tribhuvan Army Club finished third.
ANFA has not talked about conducting a new league in 2023 as it is struggling to finish the men’s league at the moment.
Not having a regular league has hurt the women’s team. A prime example is the women losing to Bangladesh after finally beating India in the semifinal of the SAFF Women’s Championship in September 2022. Many players believe if women’s football in Nepal had a proper structure, they might have had a title to show for their efforts.
Things are different in India and Bangladesh. Both countries are working with a vision to promote women’s football in their respective countries. The All Indian Football Federation, through Vision 2047, is working to develop both men’s and women’s football in the country. The Bangladesh Football Federation has also started to see the results of its investment in women’s football for a long time.
ANFA also says Nepal’s aim is to win both women’s and men’s SAFF championships. But these are limited to talks as it has not invested enough to work for this goal.
The double round-robin league was seen as a positive and with municipalities also taking part in it, many felt this would reach new heights. But ANFA, stating having teams from municipalities was problematic, has decided to conduct it in a different manner.
But when will the league commence is anyone’s guess now.

High hopes: How Nepal cricketers are preparing themselves to face India and Pakistan,"Sunday, May 7, 2023","In the second ball of the 18th over in the final of the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, Gulshan Jha hit one of the biggest six of the tournament. Before Karthik Meiyappan’s over ended, Jha hit two more boundaries as the Nepal cricket team scored 16 runs off it, which tilted the game in Nepal’s favour.
Jha’s obliteration of Meiyappan gave fans a belief that Nepal belonged on the big stage. The fans went wild as everyone at the TU Cricket Ground and millions watching at home started to dream of Nepal cricketers facing India and Pakistan at the Asia Cup in September.
This is quite rare as the current ICC’s structure rarely allows associate teams like Nepal to compete with the big boys. But here Nepal were on the verge of creating history and booking their place in the Asia Cup for the first time.
It has been 27 years since Nepal became an associate nation. But in all these years, they have not played a single game against India and Pakistan. Now, with this victory over the UAE in the final of the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, that wait is over. Fans are already excited about what happens to Nepal cricket after that.
Nepal beat the UAE by seven wickets in a rain-affected final that had to be played over two days. Bowling first after winning the toss, the team displayed one of their best performances with the ball as they reduced the UAE to 106 runs for the loss of nine wickets in 27.3 overs before the heavens opened up and ended play on May 1.
This was already a psychological boost as many felt Nepal had laid one hand on the trophy. The next day, Nepal bowled the UAE out for 117 runs and had the entire day to chase it down.
Nepal cricketers love drama. When the UAE picked up three quick wickets including that of captain Rohit Paudel, there was tension on the ground. But Monty Desai’s decision to send Gulsan Jha, who was brought to the team in place of Dipendra Singh Airee, to bat at number three for the first time proved to be a masterstroke. Thanks to his unbeaten 67 and a 96-run partnership with Bhim Sharki, Nepal won the match with 117 balls to spare.
His power-hitting was a joy to watch for the Nepal cricket fans as the left-hander dominated the UAE’s spin bowlers hitting six sixes and four fours.
Jha was drawn towards cricket thanks to Nepal’s playing in the 2014 T20 World Cup. Born in Sarlahi, Jha went to Ranchi in India at his own expense to train to become a better cricketer.
The players who he trained with there are struggling to get into the state team. Many have left India for life abroad while others quit cricket.
But Jha along with others in the team now has a chance to compete with world-class players like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Siraj and Jaspreet Bumrah among others.
Jha, who won player of the match in the final, was quite subdued in the post-match press conference.
“I was ready for any responsibility. I was able to play as instructed by the coach. I did not think about the past or the future. I wanted to think about the present and help the team win,” he said.
This is not the first time Nepal cricketers have qualified for the Asia Cup. After reaching the final in ACC Trophy in 2002, Nepal and the UAE qualified for the Asia Cup. But due to political tensions between India and Pakistan due to the Kargil War, the tournament was cancelled.
Raju Khadka, the Nepal cricket captain then, still feels the pain as all their hard work had gone in vain as the team could not take on the best teams in the world due to no fault of their own.
“We were so excited to play against test nations. But we could not go and that remains a dark day for us. Our dream was shattered,” recalls Khadka.
Now, Nepal, after 22 years, have the opportunity to play the Asia Cup again. In 2002, Nepal had been an associate country for only six years. Fast-forward to now, Nepal have retained it thanks to the team’s incredible performance in the ICC Cricket League 2.
Khadka says playing against teams like India and Pakistan is exactly what Nepal cricketers need to reach greater heights.
“The dream we saw in the 2000s is turning into a reality now. Playing against big teams will not only change our players’ mindset but it will also change the way world cricket looks at us,” says Khadka.
He is correct. Nepal cricket’s performance in the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2014 exposed players like Sandeep Lamichhane and Rohit Paudel to cricket. It lit a fire in their belly as it gave them a belief that they too could represent Nepal on the biggest stage.
“I was inspired by Paras (Khadka) dai and Gyanendra (Malla) dai during the T20 World Cup. I hope we can do the same when we play the Asia Cup,” says Paudel.
Lamichhane, who became the player of the tournament, also believes this is a great chance for them to become immortals in Nepali cricket and inspire a new generation of cricketers in the country.
Coach Monty Desai, who has been an integral part of the Nepal cricket team’s success in recent times, says that if they have a chance to demand bilateral series against full-member countries of the ICC, they can compete well against the likes of India and Pakistan.
“I cannot wait to see the team play against teams like India and Pakistan. I’m going to enjoy it and see how they play their one-ball battles against the best in the world. It will be great to see if they showcase their best in a bilateral series against these great teams,” he said in the press conference after the final.
Former cricketer Shakti Gauchan is ecstatic for the youngsters who are getting a chance to play against two great teams. He believes positive performance in the Asia Cup can result in great things for Nepal cricket.
“We should play fearless cricket against these teams. We have to show them that we are not inferior to them. If we do that, opportunities will come our way even if don’t win. Our boys will also get to play in franchise leagues across the world,” says Gauchan.
It is historic in itself for Nepal to play with India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup as an associate nation but it is not improbable. However, to get such an opportunity repeatedly, the hard work of the players and coaches is not enough. It is now up to the government to invest in cricket and cricket infrastructure.
The Nepal cricket team have had this opportunity before but failed to do so after the T20 World Cup in 2014. Nepal’s cricket infrastructure is poor. The country does not have a well-equipped international cricket stadium and it also lacks a proper structure or development plan when it comes to cricket.
Despite making promises during elections, neither the cricket body nor the state has been able to develop cricket at the grassroots level as it is limited to age-group tournaments every now and when.
Like before, the government has decided to give each member of the team that won the ACC Premier Cup Rs 600,000. While is great for the current players, experts emphasise the need for systematic planning and investment in sports infrastructure and human resources if the country wants to do well internationally.
Women’s cricket has been neglected. There is no pathway to the national team as it is dependent on a few academies. The Cricket Association of Nepal is yet to build an A team.
Monty Desai says that in the last three months, Nepal cricketers have gained experience in playing under pressure, and now the country has to invest in physical infrastructure and exposure.”
“I want there to be a development camp and Nepal A team. Now, not only for the men’s team, we have to think about the whole of Nepal cricket”, he says. “If we work hard, Nepal can be a full member soon and if everything goes as planned, we can host a test match here at TU Cricket Ground.”

The game, which was stopped due to rain on Monday, continued Tuesday with the UAE resuming batting at 106 for 9. Left-arm spinner Lalit Rajbanshi missed out on his hat trick, but the UAE batters only added 11 runs to last night’s total.
Nepal, on Monday, won the toss and chose to bowl first as they looked to take advantage of the overcast conditions. They reaped immediate rewards as they took important wickets of Mohammad Waseem and Vriitya Aravind cheaply as they reduced UAE to 35 for 4 by the 10th over.
Asif Khan, who had scored a century against Nepal when they played last, showed a fight during the ACC Men’s Premier Cup final as he put up a valiant 46, but with him getting out in the 28th over, the UAE were reduced to 106 for 9 as the umpires decided to end the day’s play taking the game to a reserve day. The UAE only managed 11 runs on Tuesday as they were bowled out for 117 runs.
Rajbanshi was the pick of the bowlers as he took four wickets while Sandeep Lamichhane and Karan KC picked up two wickets each and Sompal Kami and Gulshan Jha picked a wicket each putting Nepal in control of the match.
In reply, Nepal did not get off to a good start losing both openers and captain Rohit Paudel cheaply. But an impressive batting performance from Jha, who was moved up the order for his power hitting, took the ACC Men’s Premier Cup title out of the UAE’s reach as he scored an unbeaten 67 and put up a 96-run stand with Bhim Sarki, taking Nepal home with 117 balls to spare.
With this victory, Nepal have qualified for the Asia Cup. But there is news coming out that the Asia Cup might not take place as scheduled due to a dispute between the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/acc-mens-premier-cup-nep-win.html,sports
ACC Men’s Premier Cup: Rain-interrupted final moved to reserve day,"Monday, May 1, 2023","Kathmandu, May 1
The final of the ACC Men’s Premier Cup between Nepal and the UAE, which was interrupted by rain on Monday, will be continued on Tuesday.
The Asian Cricket Council had kept Tuesday as a reserve day just in case rain interrupted play in the final of the tournament.
The game will continue with the UAE batting at 106 for 9 and 27.3 overs bowled with spinner Lalit Rajbanshi on a hat trick.

Asif Khan, who had scored a century against Nepal when they played last, showed a fight as he put up a valiant 46 but with him getting out in the 28th over, the UAE were reduced to 106 for 9.
Rajbanshi impressed with the ball picking up three wickets, giving away only five runs in 4.3 overs. If and when play resumes, he will be on a hat trick. Sandeep Lamichhane and Karan KC picked up two wickets each while Sompal Kami and Gulshan Jha picked a wicket each putting Nepal in control of the match.
If rain obstructs the match on Tuesday and Nepal do not bat the number of overs required, the game will be taken to a super-over. If rain does not allow for the super-over to take place, Nepal will be declared the winner of the ACC Men’s Premier Cup and will qualify for the Asia Cup.

Nepal and the United Arab Emirates have reached the final of the ACC Men’s Premier Cup to be held in Kathmandu on Monday.

Mani Lama: A sportsperson with multiple hats now wants to stick to football,"Friday, April 28, 2023","Nepal APF Club lost to Manang Marsyangdi 2-1 in the Martyr’s Memorial A Division League on March 18. Disheartened by the loss, Mani Lama went to the dressing room.
As he reached there, he received a huge surprise. The newly appointed coach of the national football team Vincenzo Alberto Annese informed him about his selection to the national team and asked him to pack his luggage and come to the hotel.
After completing the short training as a part of the national football team, the 27-year-old Lama made his debut in the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup, during the match against Laos. On March 22, Lama joined the team as a substitute for Nabin Lama in the 73rd minute of the game.
Mani Lama was on the bench for the entire match during the match against Bhutan on March 28. But in the final match of the tournament against Laos, he spent the entire time on the ground.
Playing for the national team is not a new experience for him. He has been in the national futsal team from 2017 to 2022 for three times and has played in international tournaments as well. In 2019 during the South Asian Games held in Nepal, he was in a closed camp of the national table tennis team also. But now, he wants to stick to football.
Yet Mani Lama says he still cannot define the moment when he got selected for the national team for the first time.
“Earlier, I had seen Rohit Chand, Kiran Kumar Limbu and Anjan Bista only in the field. But playing with them is a different experience,” says Lama.
In his experience, the football camp also felt different from other sports. The players in the team were well experienced, commercial and independent, says Lama.
The Nepali team have changed in various ways after they got a new coach and some of the players left to go abroad. The situation made Lama a midfielder of the national team.
Due to fewer training hours, Nepal could not perform well in the first two matches. As Mani Lama was new to the team, he was not fully prepared that affected his performance. To overcome the nervousness of playing in front of thousands of people, he tried to remain calm. “I was already nervous and excited since the warm-up,” he says.
Nepal had already taken the lead 2-0 in the first match against Laos before he made his debut. Nepal won the match with the same score. But in the final, Laos took the lead at first.
Mani Lama says he was afraid then, but the goals by Ayush Ghalan and Manish Dangi made his debut tournament successful.
Lama, a resident of Chhaimale on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu, was raised in Lalitpur. Cricket and table tennis were popular in his school Adarsha Vidya Mandir (AVM).
He started training with Purshottam Bajracharya, a former national table tennis player. Then, at the age of 14, he got selected for the junior national table tennis team, in 2010.
Similarly in 2012 during SAF Championship, he won two silver medals for Nepal— in the team events and boys double event categories.
Next year, Mani Lama played in the World Cup Junior Cadet and Youth Asian Games. In 2016, during the 8th National Games, he won bronze in men’s singles for Tribhuvan Army Club.
He was shining in table tennis. But the futsal culture in Kathmandu that was growing greatly attracted him. Along with playing table tennis, he started playing futsal as well.
“I was brought up by playing football in an open space. But playing futsal on turf also provided me joy,” says Lama. “Then I started playing it regularly with neighbours, which improved my game.”
Afterwards, he joined Kick Off Futsal, a team based in Dhobighat, Lalitpur. In 2016, the team played a selection competition to form a national futsal team. The three players including Mani Lama were selected from that competition for the national team training.
In 2017, for the first time, the national futsal team of Nepal participated in qualifiers for AFC Futsal Championship in Iran. Lama was one of the key players in the team. In 2019 and in 2022, the team participated in qualifiers for AFC Futsal Championship in Iran and Thailand, respectively.
In six years, Lama played three international competitions and scored three goals in nine games.
“There used to be a few table tennis competitions, but futsal used to have weekly competitions,” says Lama. “There was this one time that I used to play both games simultaneously.”
During the SAF closed camp, Mani Lama was also playing futsal. Later, he got more interested in futsal due to the increasing number of competitions.
The established futsal player has interesting things to tell about how he became a footballer.
Football was his favourite sport since childhood. Although it was only at the age of 22 that he officially began training for football.
In 2018, Lama became associated as a table tennis player with the departmental team APF. In 2019, after getting selected for the national futsal team for qualifiers of the Asian Futsal Championship, the departmental team learnt that he would play futsal.
“After returning, Rajendra Tamang, the then APF head coach, tested me. Then, I began official training for futsal,” Mani Lama says.
In 2019, he made his debut in the A Division League, representing the APF. But he got fewer opportunities on the ground. Nevertheless, in 2021, he relatively got more opportunities to showcase his game. In the same year, the APF won the Rara Gold Cup and the Birat Gold Cup.
Lama has been an impactful player in this year’s league since the beginning. In the first five matches of the league, he scored two goals and was announced player of the match in one of the games, after which he was called to the national team.
“I believed in myself and continued playing and finally got to play for the national team. This is really a big surprise for me,” says Mani Lama.
The 27-year-old player considers it a big opportunity to prove himself because, after two and a half months, Nepal are playing in the SAF Championship and World Cup Qualifiers.
“This time, the coach formed the team in a rush. But for the SAF and the World Cup Qualifiers, things will be different. There will be other new players as well,” says Lama. “This is going to be challenging. I need to work hard.”
The skills like close control, speed control and foot control, which Mani Lama obtained from futsal, have been greatly helpful for him even in football.
Now, Lama does not want to switch to any other sports. He wants to spend his remaining career in football.
“Football is the king of sports. With a lot of effort, I got an opportunity to play for the national team,” says Mani Lama. “Now I am entirely focused on football.’

Age is just a number for cricketer Ritu Kanoujiya,"Tuesday, April 11, 2023","How many years can a player maintain an active sports life? The answer is not easy as the body undergoes a lot of changes as it gets older. No wonder many players opt to retire around 35 as their body starts giving up on them. But for the cricketer Ritu Kanoujiya, retirement is not in question.
The 41-year-old recently played for the Sudurpaschim province in the Lalitpur Mayor’s Women’s Championship and did her bit with both bat and ball. She showed that despite crossing 40, she is still physically and mentally fit proving that age is nothing but a number.
World cricket has other examples where players in their middle age have played at the highest level. England’s Kay Green made her ODI debut at the age of 45. India’s Mithali Raj is 40 and continues to play at the highest level. But Nepal is different compared to India and England as the country does not have regular games. Hence, Ritu Kanoujiya continuing to play despite this has been seen as a remarkable achievement.
Kanoujiya, who has spent nearly 12 years playing for Nepal’s national team, continues to play at the highest level in Nepal’s domestic cricket scene. She is not just participating for the sake of it; she has been performing with both bat and ball, playing important innings for her team.
But how long will Kanoujiya continue to play?
“I don’t have a set time. I’ll play until I can or until someone can replace me,” she says.
Ritu Kanoujiya started playing cricket with her brothers at the age of 9 in Baitadi in Sudurpaschim. In school, she also played badminton and volleyball, winning regional tournaments.
When she was winning those tournaments, the country did not have a women’s cricket team. But in 2007, when the Cricket Association of Nepal decided to form a team, Kanoujiya, impressing in the selection tournaments made to the team as a balling all-rounder.
Then, Ritu Kanoujiya left Baitadi and came to Kathmandu. That was not seen positively in society as she had to face a lot of criticism. She was only 25 and her father, Tekendra Lal, a former police officer; supported her dream and sent her to Kathmandu.
“Neighbours would often tell me that it was time to start a family, not play cricket. It was very demeaning back then,” she says.
But she proved all her naysayers wrong as she has continuously been in the women’s team for 12 years straight and has even captained the team for one game.
“When newspapers started to write about me, the neighbours shut up,” she says.
Cricket is Ritu Kanoujiya’s life. She knows nothing apart from cricket and is always occupied with it. When she is not playing in Nepal, she often goes to India and plays in different events there.
“I’ve been to Ahmedabad and Chandigarh and played some tournaments. The leagues there are very well managed,” she says.
Kanoujiya was also a part of the Armed Police Force’s women’s team for nearly a decade and won everything there was to win in domestic cricket. For the last three years, however, Kanoujiya has been playing for Sudurpaschim, her home province.
She says that she joined the provincial team upon request by CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand, also hailing from Baitadi, who wanted to make the team stronger.
“They wanted me to become captain but I refused as I wanted to concentrate on my own game and not the entire team,” she says.
However, Ritu Kanoujiya has continued to guide and support young girls as she wants the best for the team and for women’s cricket. That is not all, she also coaches both the men’s and women’s U16 and U19 teams in Baitadi.
“I’ve learnt a lot from Dhirendra Chand and now I want to share my knowledge with the younger generation,” she says, adding she taught cricket to young boys and girls during the pandemic.
From April 14, Kanoujiya is now starting a new role as the cricket coach of the Baitadi district. She says that she had to take on this responsibility as she had to support her family financially.
“They’ve done a lot for me over the years and I want to help them now. This way I will not be away from cricket either,” says Ritu Kanoujiya.
The woman, who lost her mother when she was young, lives with her father. Both her sisters are married and she lost her brother to Covid.
“My father did everything for me and my career, now I will dedicate my life to him,” she says.
Ritu Kanoujiya has spent over 15 years playing the sport. Now with her crossing 40, she has realised the challenges in front of her.
To keep herself fit, she exercises and runs a lot and makes sure she eats a healthy diet. But now, with more responsibilities on her shoulder, she feels she will not play for more than a year.
“I want to end my career playing for Nepal and wearing the national team jersey,” she says.
Kanoujiya wants to retire from playing in front of Nepali fans and make her final game a memorable one.
“I’ve been imagining this for a while. I want to work hard and get into the national team and retire,” she says.
Even while taking the decision to retire, she has not found a player to replace her in her province. This is a major problem for women’s cricket in Nepal and that is why Kanoujiya wants to stay at the provincial level and produce women cricketers who can play at the highest level.
“I want to give back to cricket and help in the development of the game,” says Ritu Kanoujiya.

Govt discusses* taking over Bharatpur cricket stadium project,"Tuesday, April 4, 2023","Kathmandu, April 4
The government has discussed taking over the responsibility to build the Bharatpur cricket stadium which has been left in limbo by the Dhurmus Suntali Foundation for the lack of funds.*
A cabinet meeting on Monday evening discussed the issue, informs a minister after a meeting.
If the cabinet makes a decision in this regard, the Bharatpur metropolitan city will clear all the payables and the federal Ministry of Youth and Sports will carry out the construction work.
“Once the construction will be over, we will hand over the stadium to the city government.”
Construction of the proposed Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium began on January 30, 2019. Nepalis at home and abroad as well as some expats chipped in their money, supporting the foundation financially. Everyone was hopeful that this would be Nepal’s most well-facilitated cricket stadium in a couple of years.

Nepal football in transition: What to expect after Three Nations Cup?,"Tuesday, April 4, 2023","An almost-packed Dasharath Stadium was in anticipation of something special. Every time a Nepal footballer touched the ball, all 9,000 people were on their feet hoping for a moment of magic. Nepal had dominated the entire second half of the game, yet at 1-1, Laos were still in the game.
Then came the moment the fans were waiting for. Manish Dangi, who had been Nepal’s best player, took over the game. Receiving the ball in the right flank, he took a touch, ran into the box and put the ball in the net to give Nepal the lead in the Prime Ministers’ Three Nations Cup final.
The crowd erupted. All of them were there to see Nepal win. And win they did thanks to the 87th-minute strike by Dangi who, since his debut, has shown signs he can be the next best thing in Nepal football.
But a week ago, when the competition began, things looked a bit different. The team looked, lost, disjointed and in search of an identity. Even though Nepal were playing against Bhutan and Laos, both teams ranked lower than them, people were not sure if Nepal were the favourites going into the tournament. This was no surprise as the team were in transition.
But the Nepal football team clinching the recent title has suggested something different can be expected in the near future under the new coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese.
In their first match against Laos on March 22, Nepal footballers showed in them a lack of chemistry.
The team had only come together under the new coach Annese three days before the match. That was evident as the team played with no control. The midfield looked weak as they rarely kept possession of the ball. Both Nabin Lama and Arik Bista were poor with the ball and Pujan Uperkoti was too deep to do anything.
Things were similar in the game against Bhutan where Nepal footballers struggled to keep hold of the ball in the first half. The fans were frustrated to see that there were no progressive passes. As in the first game, Lama and Bista struggled as did Uperkoti who even picked up a yellow, missing the final in the process.
The midfield struggling meant the forwards struggled too. In the first game, Nepal played Bharat Khawas and Ayush Ghalan on the wings and Nawayug Shrestha through the middle. All three struggled to keep hold of the ball and move it. Their off-the-ball movement was not great either, which meant shots were a rarity during the game. Nepal won, but that was thanks to a set piece and a wonder goal by Shrestha.
Against Bhutan, the Nepal football forwards did not get any quality service. Ghalan and Shrestha were supported by Anjan Bista, but with the midfield not playing enough progressive passes, it was a frustrating outing for the trio
One shining light in Nepal football before the final was Nepal’s defence. Ananta Tamang, Rohit Chand, Bikash Khawas and Sanish Shrestha were solid in all the games. In the first game, they did not give Laos a sniff at goal and did not make many mistakes. The team played very deep, which means the defensive line was under pressure but all four were calm. Shrestha, who made his national team debut, was impressive as he was not phased by the occasion. Khawas did give the ball away a little too much, but for a back like that had not played together, this was a good enough showing.
Against Bhutan, things were different. The team were not ready for the intensity Bhutan brought to the table. That resulted in the defensive line making multiple mistakes as Bhutan scored from a corner which could have been dealt with better. Tamang and Chand were lackadaisical along with Khawas.
The second half of the game was a lot better for Nepal footballers as they took control of the game. But it was a late strike from in-form striker Dipak Raj Singh Thakuri that saved Nepal from losing against Bhutan for the first time in history.
The Nepal football team not winning the Bhutan match comprehensively has a lot of reasons. One is a change in coach and ideology. Another is players leaving for Australia. What also did not help is the players not being able to come to terms with one another.
As Annese mentioned in his press conferences, the team over time did play better. While they resorted to playing long balls and not keeping possession in the first game against Laos, they improved against Bhutan and in the final against Laos.
With the midfield playing well, the attackers started to show promise too. Take the game against Bhutan for example. With the introduction of Kamal Thapa and a more attacking approach, the game changed. He brought energy and positive passing to the team which did not directly result in a goal, but it gave the team and the fans the belief that something would happen. Thanks to a Thakuri, it did.
Mani Kumar Lama playing his second game for Nepal was very impressive. His calmness in midfield and ability to play the ball forward was a breath of fresh air. His gameplay and ability to involve his teammates in midfield was a key reason Nepal footballers were able to control the game in the final.
Nepal won the final thanks to goals from two young stars: Ayush Ghalan and Manish Dangi. Ghalan was even announced as the most valuable player of the tournament and rightfully so. He played all three games and was Nepal’s stand-out performer. Even when nothing was going right for Nepal against Laos in the first game and against Bhutan, Ghalan continued to push the team forward with his solo runs. But each time he went forward, he did not have anyone to pass to. Ghalan scoring in the final was justice for his overall impressive display in the tournament.
Dangi also showed why former Nepal football coach Abdullah Al Muatiri spoke so highly of him. He was one of the few players in the team who showed moments of brilliance. In the final, particularly in the second half, he was magnificent as his runs created chances for both himself and his teammates. Him scoring the goal to win Nepal the cup was only fair.
Al Mutairi’s time as Nepal’s coach came to an abrupt end due to his dispute with the players. Replacing him, the All Nepal Football Association appointed Annese as the coach.
Like Al Mutairi, Annese wants to play a progressive game and has gone with a 4-3-3 formation in all three games. When chasing the game against Bhutan, he was not shy to change the formation to a 4-4-2 to take the game to the opponent. He went with a similar formation when drawing 1-1 with Laos in the final.
A coach willing to make changes when necessary is a good thing moving forwards as the team will now play their next game during the SAFF Championship in Bengaluru on June 21. He knows how much the tournament means for the country, but with most of the players playing in the league, he understands the players are going to be fatigued.
But for now, things are looking good for him. He has not lost a game and has set up a good culture within the team. How long can the team go under him is anyone’s guess, but if a team that were put together three days before a tournament can do this well, giving the coach time can only make it better.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-football-post-3-nations-cup-023.html,sports
"Sita Rana Magar: Upset, Nepal women’s cricket top performer lets the bat speak for her","Friday, March 31, 2023","After taking a wicket in the second match of the T20 series against Uganda at TU Cricket Ground in May 2022, Sita Rana Magar celebrated symbolically. She brought out the Pushpa celebration that was making the rounds in the cricketing world thanks to the film.
She was not following a trend. The celebration meant more as she wanted to show everyone that she was not going to bow down to anyone and was ready to fight for her right.
Players usually prefer to express their displeasure through symbolic gestures that cannot be expressed in words. She did exactly that on May 17, 2022, after picking up Janet Mbabazi’s wicket.
She was upset about the way she had been treated. Despite performing with both bat and ball regularly, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) removed her as the vice-captain of the team.
Since then, she has been in the form of her life. On Thursday, Sita Rana Magar’s team, the Armed Police Force, beat Koshi Province comfortably to become Lalitpur Mayor’s Cup champions for the third consecutive time.
Leading from the front, Magar dominated with the bat with an unbeaten 79 becoming the player of the match. This was not the only time she had performed well in the tournament. In the five matches, no one scored more runs (214) than her and no one picked up more wickets (8) than her.
Magar won the player of the tournament for this, but it was clear she should have won the batter and bowler of the tournament as well. But she did not and no one know why.
The best batter was given to national team captain Rubina Chhetry who scored 139 runs in five games while the best bowler was given to Nisha Shah who picked up six wickets in five games.
After that, Sita Rana Magar questioned on Twitter why she was always targeted.
This is the first time in the tournament that the top scorer did not win the best batter award. In Lalitpur Mayor’s Cup’s earlier edition, Jyoti Pandey, who has the most runs in the tournament, won the best batter award.
In the Prime Ministers Cup held in Itahari in January, Kabita Kunwar who had the most runs won the best batter award along with the player of the tournament.
So Magar not winning all three awards is quite strange as many are questioning if CAN is targeting her.
Sita Rana Magar’s performance before this tournament was not great. After being striped with the vice-captaincy, she had not performed well. But things changed during the Lalitpur Mayor’s Cup as she carried the team on her shoulders and won the cup for the third time in a row proving how good an all-rounder she was.
Since she became the captain of APF in 2019, Magar has led the team to five domestic trophies like the 8th National Games, Prime Ministers Cup, and three Lalitpur Mayor’s Cup.
So no one can question Sita Rana Magar’s leadership credentials. No one, apart from CAN, of course.
“I think I have proved myself as a cricketer and my importance to the team. I am so happy to have won the Lalitpur Mayor’s Cup,” she tells Onlinekhabar after the victory.
Sita Rana Magar is a member of the first batch of female cricketers in the country. A part of the team since 2007, the 31-year-old has seen all the highs and lows of Nepali women’s cricket. But that said, no one can question her performance or her commitment to the team as many consider her a role model.
So when she was made vice-captain, she took it as an honour. But when it was taken away from her without reason, it broke her.
Sita Rana Magar was picked by Tornadoes Women to play in FairBreak Invitational Tournament in May 2022. The team reached the final and won it.
While she was playing the tournament in Dubai, Nepal’s women’s team was playing a T20 series in Kathmandu against Uganda Women. She informed CAN that she would miss the first game of the series as her team had reached the final. Instead of replying, CAN stripped her as the vice-captain of the team.
“After that, I wanted to prove how good I was. They may think I am not worthy, but I have been giving my 100 per cent each game,” she says.
Sita Rana Magar does not care about being appointed a leader as she believes she can lead from the front with her performance with both bat and ball. She says all she cares about is playing her best and helping the team win games.
“I don’t think there is a lack of leadership in the national team. CAN has given leadership roles to others because it believes they can do a better job than me. It is okay I’ll play my game and help the team how I can,” she says.

Machhindra FC have signed Bhutanese captain and superstar Chencho Gyeltshen for the ongoing Martyrs Memorial A Division League.
The 26-year-old signed an agreement with the league champions when he was in Kathmandu with the Bhutan national team to take part in the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup.
“All process has been fulfilled and we will officially unveil him on Sunday,” said Nabin Chitrakar, football agent and former Executive Committee member of Machhindra FC. “I have tried to get him to Nepal for quite some time and finally we have him here.”
This is the first time a Nepali club signed a captain of a national team. Often compared to the global icon Cristiano Ronaldo, Chencho Gyeltshen is called the Bhutanese Ronaldo by fans.
Gyeltshen has played in the Indian Super League and the I-League and has even played in Thailand.
With the signing of Gyeltshen, Machhindra hope to move up the table. They have won only one of their five games and are currently languishing in the 11th spot thanks to most of their first-team players, including Sujal Shrestha, leaving for Australia.

Monty Desai: It’s the new coach who led Nepal cricket to the World Cup Qualifiers,"Friday, March 17, 2023","On February 6, Monty Desai officially took over as the head coach of Nepal’s cricket team and became the fifth person to coach the team during ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2.
When he took over, he knew the team needed consistency as the team had four coaches, three captains and a plethora of issues both in and outside the field. The team had not won a single game in the last series and things were looking dire as he was tasked with saving Nepal’s ODI status that was earnt through the blood sweat and tears of players from yesteryears.
Fast forward a month, and things have taken a miraculous turn. Desai has rejuvenated the team in such a way that they have done the impossible. After securing the ODI status on March 12, the team, on March 16, in a packed house at the TU Cricket Ground, defeated the UAE in a dramatic fashion thanks to the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) method and punched a ticket to the ICC World Cup Qualifiers that will be held in Zimbabwe in June.
Following the win, the players are not shying away from crediting Monty Desai emphasising how he has changed the environment in the team leading them to a series of positive performances.
“He has been great for us,” said captain Rohit Paudel during the post-match presentation.
But Desai credits the players for standing up when it mattered the most.
“The UAE had us on the ropes and we should applaud them for pushing us all the way. But the way our boys fought until the end showed how much potential the team has,” Desai said following the match.
The team’s performances have made the country proud. Over 15,000 rushed to TU Cricket Ground on Thursday. Some were there as early as 5 am to ensure they got in to witness history being made in front of their very eyes.
A month ago, when Nepal was playing Namibia, things were very different.
League 2 started in August 2019 and Nepal played their first game in February 2020. In their first 24 games, Nepal won only eight games and amassed 18 points. Their form was so bad that they were definitely on the verge of losing their ODI status.
Monty Desai knew this; he was hired to stop that from happening. But the team members were the same. People in the Cricket Association of Nepal were the same along with the infrastructure that had driven out the past four coaches in less than three years. The team had forgotten to win and if they did not learn how to win, the team were going to be in deep trouble.
He understood the challenge at hand as he had coached associate nations like the UAE, Canada and Afghanistan (who were an associate nation when he coached them). He also had experiences with the West Indies cricket team along with Indian Premier League teams.
Monty Desai knew Nepali cricket too. Ever since Nepal took part in the T20 World Cup in 2014 in Bangladesh, where he played an advisory role, he has had a keen eye on the development of cricket in the country. He knew the players and what they were capable of and, since the start, promoted that.
“I want a happy dressing room that will play for each other. This team is special and can do well,” he said knowing how important togetherness was going to be if the team wanted to do well in the coming month.
He passed his first test when Nepal beat Namibia for the first time in League 2 on February 14. The team then went on to sweep the series beating both Namibia and Scotland twice. The team morale was at an all-time high.
The challenge shifted to the UAE where Nepal had to take on the hosts and Papua New Guinea. Nepal won three out of four games and were now two away from retaining their ODI status.
But Monty Desai-coached Nepal made three comfortable wins and one nail-biter as Nepal reached the ICC World Cup Qualifiers for the first time in their history.
Everyone, from players to fans to experts, has given the credit to Desai and his coaching methods for these wins. But he feels he is just doing his job.
“I’ve been disciplined to my job and not taken anything for granted,” he says. “The players have been great and been disciplined too and played their role well as we got better with every game.”
A total of 15 players played the last 12 games with a new player stepping up in each. This was only thanks to the togetherness that was instilled in them by Desai. Take Thursday’s match for example. Many had thought Nepal would lose chasing 311 as they lost their first three wickets cheaply. But the players still believed. Desai still believed as half-centuries by four Nepal players took Nepal to a memorable victory at TU Cricket Ground.
“Our dream has come true thanks to the efforts of the players. We have the momentum now and credit for that goes to Monty sir,” said captain Paudel after the match. “We’ll be playing against better teams, but as he (Monty) says, it is a one-ball battle. Whoever is the bowler, we will be facing the same ball every game.”
Coach Monty Desai says this success is due to the positive attitude of those who work for the team in a small role as a family. He thinks CAN has been equally important in this winning run.
“Everyone has had a role to play. We wanted to show what a champion team looks like and never dwelt on the past. We played thinking what’s ahead of us,” he says. “We were like a family and fought for each other collectively.”
Monty Desai believes that this is just the beginning. He is making the players excited for the future. He is reminding the players of their plans ensuring they work hard to make sure they reach the goals he has set for them. He also asks the supporters to remain patient and support the team even when they lose matches.
“I’ve never seen a crowd like this in associate cricket. I want to thank all the fans who came out here in large numbers. But I want to tell them, this team is young and is growing up so please be patient as we might not win all games but let me tell you, they are working harder than ever before and learning from mistakes made in the past,” he says.
Without naming a particular player, Monty Desai says Nepali cricketers have huge potential as they could reach higher highest in the coming years.
“I want to request our neighbouring countries [India, Bangladesh, Pakistan etc] to keep an eye on this team because this team also deserves a place amongst you and needs your support,” he adds.
Monty Desai’s task now is to make the team ready for the ICC World Cup Qualifiers that will take place in Zimbabwe in June and July. But before that, there are the Asian Cup Qualifiers where Nepal will take on Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in April.
Desai knows how important the qualifiers are going to be as if they qualify, they will be playing with the big boys and after that, the neighbours will have no choice but to notice them.

ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2: Nepal create history and qualify for the ICC World Cup Qualifiers,"Thursday, March 16, 2023","Kathmandu, March 16
Nepal have created history by directly qualifying for the ICC World Cup Qualifiers in Zimbabwe after beating the UAE by 9 runs via the Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) method.
The umpires stopped the play after the 44th over due to poor light, by when Nepal had scored 269 for the loss of six wickets and needed 42 runs in 36 balls.
Batting first, the UAE started explosively with Muhammad Waseem continuing his fine form from Wednesday. Despite Lalit Rajbanshi getting an early wicket, Waseem continued his power hitting scoring a quick-fire 50 before getting out to Sandeep Lamichhane for 63.
The UAE innings was then steadied by Vriitya Aravind who played the role of an anchor despite wickets falling on the other end. Aravind narrowly missed out on a century, but his 135-run partnership with Asif Khan proved pivotal as the UAE reached an above-par score of 310 in 50 overs.
Khan took on the Nepali bowlers all over the park including four sixes in an over off Lamichhane as he finished with 101 off 42 balls. This was the fourth-quickest century in ODI cricket.
Apart from Lalit Rajbanshi and Dipendra Singh Airee, Nepali bowlers had a hard time as others proved quite costly. Sompal Kami went for 74 runs while Lamichanne and Gulshan Jha went for 80 and 63 runs respectively.
In reply, Nepal got off to a poor start losing opener Aasif Sheikh in the very first over. Kushal Malla and captain Rohit Paudel soon followed Sheikh back to the dressing room without adding much to the total. Kushal Bhurtel tried to play an anchor role as he posted a quickfire 50, but when he held out in the 17th over, things started looking bad for Nepal.
The Nepali innings was steadied by Bhim Sarki and Aarif Sheikh who put up an 83-run stand. When Sarki got out trying to up the scoring with the lights getting poorer, Nepal looked to be in a bit of bother but Sheikh’s 52 and Gulshan Jha’s 48-ball 50 took Nepal ahead of the UAE via the DLS method taking them to the World Cup Qualifiers in dramatic fashion.

What revived Nepal cricket team’s ODI hope in just a month?,"Wednesday, March 15, 2023","The Nepal cricket team on March 12 retained their ODI status by beating UAE at TU Cricket Ground. This, until a month ago, looked highly unlikely.
The team were in disarray as they had won only two games out of 10. But in the last month, the team won 10 out of 11 games and are one win away from reaching the ICC World Cup Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in July when they will face test nations like Zimbabwe and West Indies among others.
So what is behind this overhaul?
Nepal’s start to ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 had not been consistent. During the last four years, the Nepal cricket team have had five different coaches, three captains and a toxic and disjointed dressing room. The Covid pandemic shifting back one series after another did not help either.
In 2022, captain and superstar Sandeep Lamichhane was accused of raping a minor and was sent into judicial custody. Between all this, Nepal had forgotten to win as it had not won a single game in the League 2 series against Nabimia and Scotland in December 2022.
Following these results, the Nepal cricket team coach Manoj Prabhkar resigned and was replaced by Monty Desai on February 6. Desai’s arrival came at a time when Nepal would be playing 12 ODI matches in 32 days. Out of the 12 games, Nepal had to win nine to retain their ODI status. But Nepal did one better as Nepal won 10 out of 11 games retaining their ODI status and edging closer to the World Cup Qualifiers.
The run started in the home series against Nabimia and League 2 champions Scotland on February 14. By this time, Lamichhane had been released on bail and included in the team as the Cricket Association of Nepal stated the team needed him to save the ODI status. Nepal swept the series and Lamichhane’s selection was justified.
The team was then due to play the UAE and PNG in back to back series – one in Dubai and the other one in Kathmandu.
The series in the UAE was going to be key for the Nepal cricket team and the Supreme Court allowing Lamichhane to travel to the UAE to play gave the team a huge boost. Nepal won three out of four games in the series that ended on March 6.
The team were back in Nepal to take on the same teams. So far, they have won all three games they have played comprehensively. They now only need one more win and if they are able to beat the UAE on Thursday, the Nepal cricket team will finish in the top three of League 2 and qualify for the World Cup Qualifiers with Scotland and Oman.
It has been a little over a month since Monty Desai got the job. His main goal was to save Nepal’s ODI status. This was important for the development of cricket in the country too as the funds would dry up if Nepal were no longer an ODI nation. CAN president Chatur Bahadur Chand has said the Nepal cricket team had to include Lamichhane because they were desperate to retain the ODI status.
Lamichhane’s return has been a boon too. Out of the 11 games, he has played in 10 and taken 29 wickets including a five-wicket haul against PNG on Monday. It is safe to say that he became one of the major contributors to the team.
What has also helped the Nepal cricket team is the different players standing up in different games. Both openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have played match-winning inning and scored centuries. Captain Rohit Paudel has won Nepal the games Nepal should have lost. Other batters like Kushal Malla, Gyanendra Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee all have contributed with the bat.
Apart from Lamichhane, Karan KC, Ariee, Kushal Malla and Lalit Rajbanshi have performed well with the ball. Rajbanshi took a five-for against the UAE on Sunday restricting them to only 71 runs.
But how have the Nepal cricket team that had forgotten to win turned a corner and started to win one game after another? The players want to give credit to Desai.
Desai is someone who has worked in Nepali cricket in the past. In 2014 when Nepal reached the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, Desai worked as an advisor. He did so with the U19 team during the 2016 U19 World Cup.
It is likely the wins are thanks to his positive attitude and focus on creating a connected and happy dressing room.
“He has made things easy for us. There’s no pressure on us,” said captain Paudel after the Nepal cricket team’s win against the UAE on Sunday. “That has helped players perform when they needed to perform. The dressing room is great right now.”
Prior to becoming Nepal’s coach, Desai was working as the West Indies batting coach. Now, as he has seen his work reap rewards, he feels extremely elated. But he says CAN should also get credit for the team winning games as it has helped him a lot since he joined.
“I was excited as I knew a few players from my time before. But I knew it was going to be a challenge and that is after taking over, I emphasised the need for a connected and happy dressing room,” said Desai on Sunday. “I’m glad the team have been able to do well in the last three series.”
He believes that the result is positive because everything happened at the right time. He says each player is focused on playing for the Nepal cricket team rather than individually.
“The main role is to prepare everyone for everything in one way so that I can use their abilities in the right place when needed,” he said during a recent press conference. “The atmosphere is such that everyone believes they can help each other to take on whatever challenge that may come their way. Even when the results are not coming, I appreciate their hard work.”
A win against the UAE on Thursday and the Nepal cricket team can dream of the World Cup again. It is going to be the first time Nepal take part in the ODI World Cup qualifiers. If they lose to the UAE, Nepal go to Namibia to play in the Global Qualifier Playoff where they will have another chance to get to the World Cup.
Given how Nepal have performed in the past 11 games and how the UAE have capitulated in recent games, it is highly likely Nepal will win. But the players are not overconfident as they believe they need to work hard to ensure they go places where no Nepali team has gone.
If the Nepal cricket team make this, they will create history and etch their names in the country’s cricketing history.

Nepal football team need to win as many games as possible: Coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese,"Tuesday, March 14, 2023","Kathmandu, March 14
The Nepal national football team’s head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese has laid out his plans and ambitions for the team.
At a press conference organised on Tuesday, Annese said he had been following Nepali football for the past two years and said he was extremely proud to be the team’s head coach.
“This is the highest point of my career and I want to explore the potential Nepali football has to offer,” he said.
Speaking about hoards of players leaving the country for abroad opportunities, he said he would field new players with new strategies.
“I believe in young energetic players. Nepal has quality young players. The only thing they lack is the experience that they will get from playing more games,” he said.
When asked if he would call players who went abroad to the national team, Vincenzo Alberto Annese said that would not be the case as he would prefer players who he has seen playing.
“If a player leaves for an amateur team, I cannot see them playing for the national team. I don’t know the actual situation. I would prefer calling the players I have watched playing,” Annese said.
Coach Annese said his goal during his one-year tenure with the national team would be to win as many games as possible.
“It’s not going to be easy as we have to change a lot of things, but I will give it my all to help the team win games,” he said.
The All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) appointed Italian Annese as the head coach of the Nepal national football team on March 1.

Abdullah Al Mutairi’s role in Nepal football self-reviewed: What is he proud of? What does he regret?,"Monday, March 13, 2023","Former coach Abdullah Al Mutairi feels him winning the best coach award at the Pulsar Sports Award 2023 is a fitting end to his stint as head coach of Nepal’s football team.
“It’s like a Bollywood ending. The hero won in the end,” he says.
Al Mutairi’s tenure started off great. He has the support of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA); the players believed in his vision as did the fans who were in awe of his outspokenness, something rarely seen in a Nepali coach.
He wanted to change the culture of the team and even though the results did not go his way, the team’s performances were better than what fans were used to. The players were fighting for each other and competing against the likes of Iraq, Jordan and Australia. They lost, but the score was not as bad as many predicted.
Under Abdullah Al Mutairi, the team ever reached the final of the SAFF Championship for the first time along with the third round of the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers. But the good days did not last thanks to tensions between him and then ANFA vice president Pankaj Bikram Nembang and then with the players; he ended his stint with the national team on a sour note as he resigned only six months into his new contract.
“I should have left after the SAFF final but I stayed hoping things would change. The mentality would change. But, sadly, it didn’t,” he says.
For Abdullah Al Mutairi, he feels he did whatever he could to make Nepali football better. He changed the mentality of the players, significantly dropped the average age of the team and ensured the team played a lot more games.
“You can look back to see our team and how we played when I was coach,” he says.
But over the course of his tenure, players and ANFA officials have called him a bad person, a dictator and even arrogant. But he does not care what people say about him.
“If they feel happy calling me that, I accept it. Because I don’t want any stress. In the end, it doesn’t matter,” Abdullah Al Mutairi adds.
He feels that if he was still the head coach, he would have been blamed for the players leaving the country for a better future abroad, especially in Australia. Many players that debuted under him have left leaving the national team without key players.
“I’m happy that I am not the coach because what is happening now is sad. It’s going to derail the national team, but I do not blame the players. They left because there’s no money in football in this country.”
Abdullah Al Mutairi feels an ecosystem needs to be developed to ensure the exodus of the players stops. He says the country needs to think of football as an industry and develop plans that benefit the players too. He says an environment needs to be created in the country through which players can sustain themselves playing football.
“They have to start now.”
That is what he had planned. Signing a contract extension in 2021, Al Mutairi had made plans till 2027. But with his resignation, will these plans be successful? He feels if the government and ANFA want, it can happen and adds Nepali football will continue without him just the same.
Abdullah Al Mutairi feels the team has come a long way since he was appointed. He feels the players now are able to speak up against their clubs or ANFA, but that said he does feel that while it is good to fight for their rights, discipline is important.
“There needs to be a balance.”
So why did he quit prematurely? He says it was due to his health. He says he had to undergo a lot of stress during his time as head coach of Nepal.
“I had to undergo multiple operations on my colon after the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. My mental health wasn’t great either because there was too much stress. Every day, there was some sort of drama,” Abdullah Al Mutairi says, “There were days I would pray to Allah and ask for one normal day. It was too much and I had made up my mind, I would quit after the qualifiers in Kuwait.”
Now after a six-month break, Al Mutairi is raring to get back on the field. He feels he has had enough rest and says he will be back in football management soon.
“I have been talking to a few national teams. I’ll be back soon but I want to tell Nepali fans that I will remember them all my life.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/abdullah-al-mutairi-nepal-football.html,sports
ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2: Nepal retain ODI status by beating UAE by 177 runs,"Sunday, March 12, 2023","Kathmandu, March 12
Nepal have retained their ODI status by beating the UAE by 177 runs at TU Cricket Ground on Sunday.

Spot-fixing in Nepal T20 League: 3 released on bail,"Thursday, March 9, 2023","Kathmandu, March 9
Three people arrested for spot-fixing during the Nepal T20 League have been released on bail.
Kathmandu District Court judge Rajendra Kumar Shrestha released them on bail of Rs 300,000 each as the police could not find evidence that these people did take money to fix matches.
Following the order, cricketer Adil Ansari, former cricketer Mehboob Alam and local cricketer Nitesh Gupta have submitted the bail amount and have been released.
A case had been registered at the Kathmandu District Court against five people for their role in spot-fixing during the controversial Nepal T20 League.
The investigation conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CIB) led by DSP Sundar Tiwari revealed that former national cricketer Mehboob Alam and Jatin Ahluwalia, the owner of Seven3Sports, a business and strategic partner of Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), offered players for fixing in the league matches.
During the investigation conducted by the CIB, an audio recording was found, in which Alam tried to lure the players by offering them Rs 3.6 million for fixing six matches.
In the statement given to the police by Alam at Government Attorney’s Office in Kathmandu, he reportedly admitted to approaching players for spot-fixing.
The police had proof that Ansari threw one no-ball and one wide-ball after being asked to do so by a person called Samir Sheikh via WhatsApp. He was offered Rs 100,000 for doing so.
But Ansari told the police he bowled the no-ball and wide-ball by accident. As the money was not a lot, he felt the person on WhatsApp was joking.

Dipesh Kandel: The bowler who sent Nepal back to the U19 Cricket World Cup,"Wednesday, March 8, 2023","Last Thursday (March 2), Nepal were staring at another defeat at the hands of the UAE. As captain Dev Khanal gave the ball to Dipesh Kandel, he was looking for nothing but a miracle. The UAE needed only 11 runs to win the match and break Nepali hearts to reach the U19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2024.
In 2019, the UAE won by one run thanks to the Duckworth Lewis method to reach the U19 World Cup in 2020. Thanks to that victory and performance, the UAE were given a place in the U19 World Cup 2022, which meant Nepal had not competed in the U19 World Cup since 2016.
But thanks to Dipesh Kandel’s hat trick, Nepal have another chance to play in the World Cup next year, for which the newly found star says they need to work very hard.
Only managing to score 191 and playing against the hosts, things were not looking good for Nepal last week. The UAE, even though they only had three wickets in hand, looked comfortable. Almost too comfortable…
Defending 10 runs, Dipesh Kandel gave three runs in his first three balls. Then came a twist that only a sport like cricket can offer.
In his fourth ball, Kandel clean-bowled Harshit Seth. Now there was hope as a new batter was coming and the pressure was on.
“This wicket was important as it opened the game for us,” says Kandel. “We knew anything could happen from then on.”
He and the team knew they needed wickets to win the game. They were confident too, he recalls.
“Everyone was hyping me up. I believed I could win it for us,” he says.
When Harit Shetty held out to Dev Khanal, the game turned on its head. Nepal, who were dead and buried a few balls ago, were now favourites.
“It was ecstasy at the point. The next ball was going to be the most crucial ball of my career,” he says.
The team were encouraging him too. This was the moment for which Dipesh Kandel and the entire team had worked hard.
He threw the ball as if it was his last. Gajeswaran tried to play it but missed it completely as the ball crashed onto the stumps giving Kandel a hat trick and sending Nepal to the U19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in a dramatic style.
Kandel did not know what to do. The moment was too emotional for him. He could not help but cry as he took his country to the U19 World Cup after nine years.
“I cannot explain what I was feeling at the moment. It is the best day of my life,” says Kandel. “These types of opportunities do not come often for people like us.”
If not for his efforts, the team would once again miss out world cup. During moments like these, the team usually put all their faith in players to come up with the goods.
“Dev (Captain Dev Khanal) told me how I had a chance to create history and asked me to take it one ball at a time. He and other team members gave me all the confidence I needed and that was that,” he says.
Cricket does not see many hat tricks. But for Dipesh Kandel, taking a hat trick was not as big as winning the game for the team.
“All our hard work paid off.”
Kandel was the hero for the day. But he feels this was a team effort and not something he did alone.
“The country won. Everyone played a part in this victory.”
Born in Latikoili in Surkhet, Dipesh Kandel’s cricketing career started far away from his home, in Biratnagar in eastern Nepal.
He started off playing gully cricket with a tennis ball. In the initial years, he was having fun, but as years went by, cricket became a part of his identity.
“I never thought I would play for Nepal. But as I joined a cricket academy, I started taking it seriously,” he says.
With every local tournament, Dipesh Kandel started to dream about playing for the country. He worked extra hard and that hard work paid off when he led the team to the U19 World Cup this time.
To develop as a cricketer, Kandel lives alone in Biratnagar. So far, his family has supported him in every aspect which has worked as a foundation for him.
“They have done everything they can for me to succeed. I want to make them proud,” he says.
Success has not come easy for him either. Dipesh Kandel has been representing Koshi province’s U19 team for most of his life, but he was not part of the province’s team for the Prime Minister’s Cup.
“I was in Surkhet when the closed camp happened and sadly I was left out of the team.”
But Kandel has played senior-level games too. He was in the Biratnagar Warriors when they won the Everest Premier League in 2017 and has represented the Koshi province in earlier versions of the Prime Minister’s Cup.
“I feel great to be a part of the teams that win, but I know I need to do more and keep working hard if I want to get to the next level,” he says.
Dipesh Kandel’s eyes are now set on the U19 World Cup in Sri Lanka. To do well there, he understands he needs to work very hard.
“The World Cup is a huge stage where we are going to take part after eight years. We need to work very hard if we want to do well.”

Usha Bhandari: Nepal’s volleyball prodigy proves a father’s role in shaping a daughter’s life,"Thursday, March 2, 2023","It was her father’s dream that drew Usha Bhandari, a native of Tanahun in central Nepal, towards volleyball, Nepal’s national game.
In 2014, her father Gajendra Bhandari, who was once a local volleyball player, went to the covered hall of the Dasharath Stadium with a friend to watch international women’s volleyball match that was between Nepal and Sri Lanka.
In that match, a Sri Lankan player with the number 7 jersey grabbed Gajendra’s attention. He still does not know the name of that player, but at that time he saw an image of his daughter in that Sri Lankan player.
This made him think of making Usha Bhandari a volleyball player. Immediately after reaching home, Gajendra asked Usha whether she wanted to join a volleyball team. Without any second thought Usha, who then was a captain of the school’s football team, agreed to her father’s decision. In retrospect, today, she believes it was the best decision of her life as her father takes pride in her achievements in her nine-year-old career.
The 18-year-old national volleyball player has accomplished a lot of things that a few sportspeople will ever dare to accomplish, despite playing for a very long time.
Usha Bhandari became the winner of Central Zone Volleyball Champion in 2019 and 2021 then runner-up in the 2019 South Asian Games as a member of the Nepal women’s volleyball team. She has also been a player in international clubs such as Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), Falcon Club, Vashafaru Club, and Eagle Club. She was also awarded the best player in the NVA National Women’s and Men’s Volleyball Championship.
Just recently, she has become a nominee for the People’s Choice Award under the NSJF Pulsar Sports Award 2078.
At the age of 12, Usha Bhandari played her first volleyball championship at the NVA Cup, representing Nepal Police Club. Two years later, she made her debut in the national team during the 13th South Asian Games 2019, organised in Nepal.
Through her progress, she has already proved that age is just a number, but she still has a long way to go.
Usha Bhandari says it is not merely her hard work and dedication that made her an established volleyball player at such a young age. The support from her family has an equal role in making it happen.
“My family has always been my driving force; they just want me to study and focus on volleyball,” the player says.
Bhandari’s father tries as far as possible to attend every match played by her. She says that the presence of her father gives her extra energy during the match and she also feels safe having her father around during the matches.
The dad, who claims himself as the biggest fan of Usha Bhandari, says, “Watching her playing on the court every time makes me proud and blessed.”
Not even the matches, but the proud father also does not want to miss her training.
She is the youngest player in Nepal’s national women’s volleyball team.  But, becoming the youngest player in the team has its own challenges despite being loved by all.
“Everyone in the team has high expectations from the young players, and failure to meet those expectations makes you nervous,” says Usha Bhandari.
In addition, she says the young players also mount pressure on the seniors to improve their games. If seniors do not play well, they will be replaced by the young ones. So in this regard, for the betterment of volleyball, Bhandari sees a great need for young and talented volleyball players. She expects a good number of young players in volleyball in the coming days.
Since volleyball as a sport is relatively growing in recent times, Bhandari sees a plethora of opportunities in it. “One can even be able to sustain their life through it,” she says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/usha-bhandari-volleyball-player.html,sports

While releasing the cricket star on bail, the Patan High Court has barred Lamichhane from leaving the country, but his fans and some other stakeholders have put pressure on CAN to make it possible for him to go to the UAE and play against the hosts and Papua New Guinea.
The pressure is growing bigger as Lamichhane performed well in the recent tri-series which Nepal swept in their homeland by winning both matches against Scotland and Namibia.

Nepal T20 League: Case filed against 5 for involvement in spot-fixing,"Monday, February 20, 2023","Kathmandu, February 20
A case has been registered at the Kathmandu District Court against five people, including cricketer Adil Ansari and former cricketer Mehboob Alam for their role in spot-fixing during the controversial Nepal T20 League.
Government attorney Achut Mani Neupane tells Onlinekhabar the case was filed based on the investigation conducted by the Central Investigation of Bureau (CIB).
An investigation committee was formed under the leadership of DSP Sundar Tiwari of the Bureau after the suspicion of spot-fixing in the Nepal T20 League became public. Police said that the involvement of 12 people was confirmed during the investigation conducted by the committee.
Among them, Nitesh Gupta, a local cricketer from Birganj, was arrested along with Alam and Anasari. According to the government attorney’s office, Navin Kandel, the co-owner of the Kathmandu Knights, and Ravi Majhi of Saptari have also been registered as fugitive defendants.
The petition has demanded they be sentenced as per sections 31, 32 and 33 of the National Sports Development Act.
According to this, those involved in such activities can be imprisoned for three years and fined up to 50,000 rupees.
Interestingly, Jatin Ahluwalia, the alleged mastermind behind the spot-fixing case, has not been made the defendant in the case.
Police had said Ahluwalia along with Seven3Sports CEO Abhishek Saklani were both involved in spot-fixing along with Indian nationals Samir Sheikh, Birendra Sah, Biash Dhyani, Rahul Sharma and West Indian Andre McCarthy.
But their names have been mentioned in the case and will be prosecuted if they are arrested in Nepal.

"Here’s how Jatin Ahluwalia, the strategic partner, masterminded Nepal’s 1st cricket spot-fixing case","Thursday, February 16, 2023","The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has finalised the investigation of the spot-fixing scandal that plagued the recently concluded Nepal T20 League, naming Jatin Ahluwalia, the co-founder of Seven3Sports, the commercial and strategic partner of the Nepal T20 League, as the mastermind.
As the report has been submitted to the government attorneys, a Nepali court will see a spot-fixing case for the first time in its history.
Nepal T20 League was the Cricket Association of Nepal’s first official franchise tournament that was held in Kathmandu from December 24, 2022, to January 11. As the league was ongoing, news of spot-fixing emerged, after which cricketer Adil Ansari and former cricketer Mehboob Alam were arrested. One more person was arrested for approaching a national team player.
According to an investigator, spot-fixing done by Alam is just the tip of the iceberg as Jatin Ahluwalia’s role in the league makes a curious case to learn lessons from in the future.
Seven3Sports got involved in Nepal T20 League after signing the initial agreement with CAN on January 2021. It was named the strategic and commercial partner for a decade for Rs 420 million. This was not taken well by some CAN members, after which the term was revised. Then, Seven3Sports was made a strategic and commercial partner for eight years for Rs 330 million.
In this amendment, CAN added conditions regarding the amount to be paid to it by Seven3Sports and the players by the teams.
By then, Jatin Ahluwalia had won over the trust of most CAN members. Therefore, even though he did not comply with any of the revised conditions, CAN took no action against him.
Instead, he tried to use it to his advantage. The Delhi tour of the Nepali cricket team is proof of this. Before going to Namibia to take part in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2, the Nepali team went to Delhi to play two practice matches.
The day the team arrived in Delhi, they were taken to a restaurant for dinner by Jatin Ahluwalia and Abhishek Saklani, the Seven3Sports CEO. According to a member of the Nepal team, representatives of Seven3Sports tried to get close to some cricketers during the tour.
There are claims Seven3Sports, privy to the strengths and weaknesses of many Nepali cricketers, tried to take advantage of their situation. A national team player says it tried to lure some players with promises of iPhones and cricket kits. Players were even held back at the offices of Seven3Sports in Gurgaon for photo and video shoots.
CAN acting secretary Durga Raj Pathak confirms Seven3Sports representatives met the players of the national team during their visit to Delhi. He says the visit was meant to connect Nepali players with franchise team owners. This is odd as the team owners should have done it separately. And, it was not the best time to meet the players as the team were there to prepare for an important series and not the Nepal T20 League.
If so, why did Jatin Ahluwalia and the representatives of his company meet the players? To know the answer, you have to look for the connection between Ahluwalia and the franchise team owners.
CAN and Seven3Sports announced six franchise teams for Nepal T20 League in July 2022. The teams were Biratnagar Super Kings, Janakpur Royals, Kantipur Gurkhas, Pokhara Avengers, Lumbini All Stars and Farwest United.
Out of them, only Lumbini All Stars and Pokhara Avengers were owned by Nepalis. The remaining teams were owned by people who Jatin Ahluwalia knew and was close with.
The choices of captains were also criticised from the start as the police believe the teams chose the captains to ensure spot-fixing happened in a subtle manner. It came as a shock to many when Nepali players were overlooked and international players were made captains.
Another interesting thing happened prior to the tournament. As the league was getting shrouded in controversy, Kantipur Media Group, which owned Kathmandu Gurkhas, pulled out of the tournament. The team then got rebranded as Kathmandu Knights, which was co-owned by Nabin Kandel. Even though Kandel was the co-owner, Jatin Ahluwalia’s confidant Bikas Dhyani was appointed as the chief financial officer.
Kathmandu’s team were built under the ownership of the KMG. This meant the team’s formation and captain could not be changed at the last minute. However, the police investigation states Dhyani, who was Kathmandu’s CFO, was approached for spot-fixing. An international player approached by him informed his captain Gyanendra Malla, who then reported the offer to the head of the anti-corruption unit (ACU) Vir Singh.
According to the investigators, Biratnagar manager Rahul Sharma and their captain West Indian Andre McCarthy were involved in spot-fixing. Janakpur and Farwest players were approached for fixing by their managers but they refused and immediately reported to the ACU chief.
The police report states Jatin Ahluwalia and his team asked players to fix matches promising them it would help them to get to the Indian Premier League and other top leagues. According to a CIB official, they (Seven3Sports and some franchise teams) came to Nepal with a plan to earn money through betting and spot-fixing.
Seven3Sports, which spent huge sums of money to become a commercial and strategic partner in the Nepal T20 League, had no official sponsor. A day before the tournament, 1XBat was announced as the main sponsor. Oddly, 1XBat, which is said to be a sports equipment manufacturing company, has not started its production yet.
Police believe Seven3Sports was trying to earn money through live betting and spot-fixing. Why? In India, Seven3Sports is registered as a betting company. They say Jatin Ahluwalia had already fixed things with some team owners and captains so that he could bet millions to get a higher return.
Take the match between Biratnagar Super Kings and Janakpur Royals on December 31, 2022, as an example.
Chasing 190 to win, Biratnagar was expected to play big shots from the start. Linden Fraser, Biratnagar’s coach, had the same thing planned and wanted Pradeep Airee and Gauranshu Sharma to open the innings and play attacking shots from the start. But, the team manager Rahul Sharma intervened and told Fraser to send the captain McCarthy instead. Despite being a former international cricketer, and chasing 190, his batting was very defensive as Biratnagar only scored 29 runs in the powerplay. Biratnagar lost the match by 49 runs and their coach vented his frustrations on how the openers played unnaturally during the powerplay.
During the CIB’s investigation, it has been confirmed that less than 30 runs had to be scored in the powerplay and McCarthy ensured it happened.
According to an official, when the CIB started investigating after receiving complaints regarding spot-fixing, Seven3Sports owner Jatin Ahluwalia along with CEO Saklani, Biratnagar manager Sharma and Kathmandu chief financial officer Dhyani had fled to India.
“If they could have been arrested, many things would have been revealed,” says an investigator. “But, our investigation confirms spot-fixing happened. But, how much money was transacted? We don’t know yet.”

Rape-accused Sandeep Lamichhane in the national team: Will it save or spoil Nepal cricket?,"Friday, February 10, 2023","Since Thursday, social media in Nepal are going frenzy after Nepal’s cricket governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), included Sandeep Lamichhane, a cricketer accused raping of a minor, in the squad of the Nepal-Namibia-Scotland tri-series, taking place from February 14 to 21 at the Tribhuvan University Ground.
After the announcement of the squad, the cricket governing body is largely receiving flak from people of different walks while CAN has gone defensive. Whereas CAN says he is included in the team as he is the need, apparently to save the country’s ODI status that is at stake following poor performances, the opponents say it will instead tarnish the global image of Nepal cricket.
On October 6, exactly one month after a rape complaint was filed against him, Sandeep Lamichhane was arrested at the Kathmandu airport. The Kathmandu District Court sent him to judicial custody to proceed with the case. But, on January 12, the Patan High Court released him on bail of Rs 2 million, still restricting him from going abroad until the final verdict.
According to CAN, Lamichhane was included in the squad because the court order has not prohibited him from playing the match.
“Respecting the court’s order, we will try to use Lamichhane’s potential as far as possible,” says CAN president Chatur Bahadur Chand.
Since the beginning of the Sandeep Lamichhane rape case, CAN did not look committed to justice but negligent. For instance, the hearing of the Attorney General’s Office’s appeal against the High Court’s order to release Lamichhane was scheduled for Friday (February 3) but CAN decided to lift his suspension a day earlier.
Secondly, CAN also did not conduct any kind of investigation even after finding Lamichhane spending a night away from the closed camp prior to the ODI series in Kenya in August 2022.
Yet, CAN’s acting secretary Durga Raj Pathak says, “It is our responsibility to protect our children. CAN is Lamichhane’s guardian. Respecting the court’s order, we have decided to include him in the team.”
CAN says it also studied international practices and consulted the ICC and the Office of the Attorney General before lifting Sandeep Lamichhane’s suspension.
“Everyone provided a positive response, and the national team was also in need of Lamichhane. There is no bad intention behind our decision,” adds Pathak.
But, the opponents think otherwise.
Activist Mohna Ansari says the government of Nepal has adopted the policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, but CAN, which enjoys government facilities, has breached the policy. “Can it do so?” she questions.
“CAN office bearers are violating the constitution and considering their charter as a law. This is totally wrong,” says Ansari.
The pride of the country will be affected if accused of such a Sandeep Lamichhane, an accused of a serious criminal offence, will be included in the team, she says.
There are several similar voices on social media.
“Go to hell CAN  for normalising rape!,” tweets activist Hima Bista. “Including a rape accused on the national team is the worst form of gender-based violence and thank you National Women Council and every leader, especially female leaders, for being silent on this! #BoycottCAN.”
Meanwhile, many Nepali people have decided to not support their own cricket team this time because of Sandeep Lamichhane’s inclusion. They have been running the campaign #boycottCAN.
Swarna Tamrakar is one among them. She tweets, “ I will stand by my decision of not supporting the Nepali cricket team as long as they have a rape accused in the team. #boycottCAN”
“#BoycottCAN This team is not my Nepal National team,” writes another Twitter user Niroj Upreti.

Nepal cricketers play under pressure following Nepal T20 League spot-fixing dispute,"Thursday, February 9, 2023","Nepal’s cricket team are currently in a closed camp to prepare for the triangular series against Namibia and Scotland that is a part of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2.
After months of uncertainty, Nepal cricketers even have a coach as Monty Desai was officially appointed the head coach on Monday.
Desai has been putting the players through the paces for over a week now as he plans to ensure Nepal do well in the home series against Namibia and Scotland that starts on February 14. He says the team are ready to fight, but given what happened over the course of the past month or two, it will be interesting to see how ‘ready’ the Nepal cricketers are.
The spot-fixing case during the recently completed Nepal T20 League has rocked Nepali cricket. It has not only shaken the Cricket Association of Nepal, but also the players and their psyche.
The competition organised by CAN has been shrouded in controversy from the start. But, things got ugly when reports of spot-fixing emerged.
A preliminary investigation report of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) even states that some franchise team owners along with the strategic and commercial partner of the league, Seven3Sports, were also involved in spot-fixing.
Accused of supporting fixers, former cricketer Mehboob Alam and all-rounder Adil Ansari were arrested by Nepal Police and are currently behind bars.
The arrest of these two has affected the current crop of Nepal cricketers as most of them had looked up to Alam who became a household name in Nepali cricket after taking all 10 wickets against Mozambique in 2008. Ansari, 19, on the other hand, is a friend of many of the current crop of players.
The CIB is still investigating the spot-fixing case. It has not officially said anything, but the names of some Nepal cricketers are being discussed as the ones being involved in spot-fixing due to their performance in Nepal T20 League. This has increased the fear among cricketers that they might also be accused of spot-fixing.
A current national team member says, in the past, all they had to face when they did not play well was criticism. But now, he fears people will accuse him of spot-fixing if his performance is not up to standards.
“This is playing on my mind ever since this case came to light. I’ve started to doubt myself,” he says wanting to remain anonymous.
The team members are selected based on the matchups and the condition of the wicket. Players feel that if the risk taken by the captain or the player does not bear fruit, they will be accused of fixing.
The performance of players in cricket, like any other sport, will not be the same in every game. In some games, players do exceptionally well, while in other games, things might be the opposite. That said, some Nepal cricketers feel their character might be questioned during the ongoing series due to what happened in the Nepal T20 League.
“I can be called a fixer any time. It’s scary and frustrating,” says a national team cricketer.
Former cricketer and coach Manoj Katuwal says fans and supporters of the game are bound to feel this way when CAN’s strategic partner has been accused of fixing matches.
“How will the fans trust the cricketers when the environment has been so negative,” he questions. “It’s sad to see that innocent Nepal cricketers now have to face the pressure and play with fear in their hearts and mind as they don’t want to be called fixers.”
Rohit Kumar Paudel, the captain of the Nepal national team, says he too feels scared that people will accuse him of fixing matches when he does not perform well.
But, he says all he and the team care about is winning games for the country.
“Fixing is a serious issue. But, we are trying to not let it affect us and are concentrating to do well in the series and trying to block all the negativity coming from the outside,” says Paudel.
All-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee says that since spot-fixing is based on a person’s thinking and behaviour, he is focusing solely on cricket to not let it affect him.
“You need to be honest to yourself and the game. If you listen to outside noise, that will just make you anxious needlessly,” says Airee. “I try and keep myself away from negativity. Whenever I play, all my focus is on batting, bowling and fielding and getting better at all three aspects of the game.”
Opener Kushal Bhurtel says the Nepal T20 League’s spot-fixing incident has taught Nepal cricketers a big lesson. He understands that if a game does not go in Nepal’s favour and he does not play well in the game, accusations of fixing are going to come his way.
“We don’t want to hear about spot-fixing and are fully focussed on winning each game and will give our 100 per cent for the same,” says Bhurtel.

Spot-fixing in Nepal T20 League: One more arrested for approaching national team player,"Wednesday, February 8, 2023","Kathmandu, February 8
Nepal Police arrested one more person involved in spot-fixing during the Nepal T20 League.
Nitesh Gupta, who plays for a local team in Birgunj, was arrested by police officials from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) and brought to Kathmandu for further investigations.
According to CIB’s preliminary investigations, Gupta approached a national team player, who he is close friends with, to get out hit-wicket during Nepal T20 League.
The player, however, refused to do so and reported it to the anti-corruption unit. Gupta was arrested based on this, says a source from the CIB.
According to the investigating officers, Gupta was asked to approach the player by an Indian national. Police say the player was offered Rs 300,000 for each spot-fixing incident.
On January 23, CIB arrested national team member Adil Ansari and ex-cricketer Mehboob Alam on charges of being involved in spot-fixing. According to CIB, 11 people’s involvement has been seen so far.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/spot-fixing-one-more-arrested-nepal.html,sports
Bharatpur cricket stadium: Dhurmus-Suntali’s dream lands in limbo,"Wednesday, February 8, 2023","Dev Neupane, 61, of Parbat, went to Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium, also known as the Bharatpur cricket stadium, during his recent visit to Chitwan.
He had heard a lot about the stadium being built under the leadership of the comedian duo Dhurmus (Sitaram Kattel) and Suntali (Kunjana Ghimire) under the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation. Out of curiosity, he went there to look at the progress of the stadium. He climbed the view tower inside the stadium to get a view of it.
“I doubt if the project would conclude anytime soon,” he told after the tour.
For the last one and a half years, there has not been a single progress on the construction of the Bharatpur cricket stadium. Instead, wild bushes are seen growing inside the stadium. The pillars are getting rusty too. The condition of the grass is deteriorating. The living quarters for the workers are getting old and damaged.
There was a next-level excitement when the construction of the stadium began on January 30, 2019. Nepalis at home and abroad as well as some expats chipped in their money, supporting the foundation financially. Everyone was hopeful that this would be Nepal’s most well-facilitated cricket stadium in a couple of years.
But, after the Covid outbreak, the story of Bharatpur cricket stadium changed.
To overcome the financial crisis, a mahayagya, a nine-day religious event, was conducted in the stadium that began on February 1, 2021. But, the mahayagya also could not collect the expected amount of money. Due to a hefty financial crisis, and Dhurmu-Suntali Foundation had to stop the construction of the Bharatpur stadium.
According to the foundation, only 39 per cent of the work has been completed so far. A total of 286 pillars have been installed in the parapet of the stadium which would have a capacity of 30,000 spectators. However, all the pillars are not placed properly. More parapets are anticipated, but it is uncertain when they will be constructed.
“The couple’s courage to start the project is appreciable, but maybe the time was not favourable for them,” says Neupane. “Now, the project should not be left stranded, this should be completed anyhow.”
The government should also do something about the Bharatpur cricket stadium, he adds.
As the foundation was unsure who would pay the loan of Rs 184.3 million, the construction of the stadium was halted on August 6, 2021, according to Dhurmus.
According to an audit of Bharatpur Metropolitan City, of the said loan amount, only Rs 19.7 million has been repaid with the support of different organisations and individuals. The remaining amount should be paid to the companies that supplied construction materials for the stadium. The foundation has to pay Rs 34.726 million to Chitwan Redimex, Rs 23.5 million to Jagdamba Enterprises, Rs 21.5 million to Bishes and Co Private Limited, and Rs 20 million to Hama Steel.
According to Dhurmus, if one-fourth of the money expected from the mahayagya had been collected, they would have had adequate money to clear the debt. The foundation had expected to generate Rs 694.6 million from the mahayagya, but only Rs 94.16 million was collected.
Several contractors, social workers, various organisations and government bodies promised to provide financial aid for the Bharatpur cricket stadium during the mahayagya, but they could not keep their word, Dhurmus laments.
Hence, to collect the required amount, the foundation sold fruits and made charity films, but nothing helped, according to him.
Whereas Neupane feels the government should take over the Bharatpur cricket stadium project to continue it, the comedian-philanthropist is expecting the government to take responsibility for the stadium and complete its construction.
Dhurmus says he is not solely responsible for the stadium. According to an agreement with the Bharatpur metropolitan city, the foundation has expected generous support from the metropolitan city as it has from other organisations. He says as the local government, the city should not rescue the project and take it to the conclusion.
Stating the same, he sent a letter to the city government on December 17, 2021, but could not get a positive response. In the letter, the foundation also said it would not claim any ownership of the Bharatpur cricket stadium if the government wants so.
Dhurmus laments that his plea remained unheeded by all the concerned bodies. “I am tired of knocking on the doors of Singhadarbar (the federal government),” he says.
“I am always ready to help to complete the stadium.”
But, Bharatpur Mayor Renu Dahal says the local government is not ready to take over the Bharatpur cricket stadium project at the current status of excessive liability.
She claims that the construction work will resume immediately if the foundation clears all the loans.
Dhurmus says that he took loans to pay the wages of the workers and pay for the credit. “I cannot remain indifferent to workers and their hard work,” he says.
“I would have lost all my reputation if I had not taken a loan to pay their wages.”
Meanwhile, Dhurmus and Suntali are also criticised for not maintaining financial transparency. They have not revealed the expenses of the Bharatpur cricket stadium.
Dhurmus blames the red tape involved in the audit process for the delay. “Very soon, I will inform everyone about the status of construction and expose all the hurdles I suffered through.”
The Bharatpur metropolitan city and the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction have prepared separate financial reports about the Bharatpur cricket stadium. While the reports have not been published, Onlinekhabar has obtained both.
If you tally the two reports, the expenses do not match. According to the report of the metropolitan city, the total expense of the stadium is Rs 579 million, but it is Rs 630 million as per the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction.
The audit report prepared by the metropolitan city office was sent to The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN), for verification.
ICAN appointed G Prakash and Associates to examine the entire financial status of the Bharatpur cricket stadium. The company completed the audit and submitted it to the metropolitan city office on February 11, 2022. But it has not made the report public. According to an audit report obtained by Onlinekhabar, the expenditure on the stadium was Rs 579.2 million.

Monty Desai gets official appointment as Nepal cricket coach,"Monday, February 6, 2023","Kathmandu, February 6
Over a week after he began training Nepal cricket team members, Indian Monty Desai received the official appointment as the head coach of the team.

“Now, he can sign the contract and begin the job.”
CAN took nearly a month to select the head coach this time due to the updated government rules about the involvement of foreigners in sports events. The national cricketing body had begun the appointment process by calling for applications on January 9.

"Futsal in Nepal: Amid hurdles, growing up slow and steady as a business","Sunday, February 5, 2023","After a ligament tear on his knee in 2021, Avishek Shrestha stopped playing futsal. After the injury during a match, doctors recommended he take a break of at least two years. But when he got a call from his friends asking him to play in a tournament in December 2022, he could not say no.
“The World Cup was on and I was itching to play. I’d been away from it for over 18 months and when I got back, I was like I never left,” says Shrestha.
Winter months are considered to be an off-season for futsal in Nepal, but this year, things were different. Thanks to the first-ever winter World Cup, most futsal grounds were packed. According to data, bookings in some futsal arenas in Nepal rose by up to 200 per cent during the World Cup. This came as a much-needed reprieve to futsal owners, many of whom were struggling as they had only opened sporadically during the Covid pandemic that hit the country hard for two years.
After a few years of struggle, things are looking up. But that said, many fear with poor policy and unhealthy competition, futsal in Nepal as a business is facing multiple hurdles.
However, despite these obstacles, the Nepali futsal community remains committed to promoting and growing the sport. Local tournaments and leagues are being organised and players are working to develop their skills and improve the quality of play.
Raj Maharjan started Dhuku Fustal Hub in Baluwatar of Kathmandu in 2013. A fan of football, he saw a lot of potential in futsal in Nepal and invested heavily to set up two futsal courts in the same place. The early years were great for him as people from all over the valley came to play.
“There were hardly 50 futsal courts back then so we got a lot of business. When the 2014 FIFA World Cup came around the corner, everyone wanted to play,” says Maharjan.
It was not just Dhuku that was doing well. Futsal in Nepal as a business across the valley started to boom. Almost every futsal ground during the 2014 World Cup was full with some earning around Rs 1 million a month.
By the next World Cup in 2018, there were nearly 200 futsal courts in the valley. This meant what happened in 2014 did not repeat in 2018.
“That discouraged a few people as they didn’t get a bigger slice of the pie. But things were sustainable,” says Maharjan.
What did not help futsal in Nepal as a business was what happened in 2016 when the police ordered that all futsal courts in the valley be closed. The police took such a decision, stating people misused the facilities to take illegal drugs and get involved in unsocial activities. People who lived near futsal courts had also filed complaints that these courts obstructed the peace and order of society.
“That was tough because these people had a prejudice that everyone did drugs in futsal courts. Society didn’t understand the game and the potential it had,” says Thamman Bhusal, a futsal operator who has built over 200 courts all over Nepal.
Times changed, as did people’s perceptions, thanks to the corporate sector that started to play futsal in Nepal regularly. But, then came the Covid pandemic and government restrictions, which put everything to a standstill.
“The two years of Covid hit us bad. None closed but everyone incurred losses as these businesses aren’t cheap,” says Bhusal.
WePlay Nepal, an application that helps players book futsal, has been witnessing this trend. Smriti Bajracharya Branding and Communication Head at WePlay Nepal says even though the past few years were tough on businesses, the World Cup in Qatar brought a much-needed reprieve to futsal in Nepal.
She says that they expected bookings to go further down than during the festive period, which was also hit by dengue, but things went surprisingly smooth after the group stage.
“We assumed bookings would further slow down as the match timings clashed with the player’s usual playing hours. But, booking requests increased by 188 per cent from when the World Cup started,” says Bajracharya.
She says most players were willing to play at any location, regardless of the distance.
“It seemed as long as they got to play, the distance travelled did not pose a big issue. We also noticed a rise in bookings placed late at night, especially after the match had ended,” she says, adding the World Cup hangover is continuing in futsal in Nepal despite the final being played over a month ago.
Bhusal feels futsal culture has changed too over the years. The players and their mindsets have changed. They are more disciplined and come with proper gear. The courts have changed too as the owners have realised the need to improve them.
“I’ve evolved too as doing it for 10 years has made me better equipped to make better courts,” says Bhusal, who now gives people a general idea of how to do the business of futsal in Nepal.
But, there are challenges, he says. While government and policy-related challenges are always going to plague them, a lack of land in the Kathmandu valley is another issue that businesses face at the current times. Nonetheless, futsal in Nepal as a culture is dispersing across the country.
“There will come a time when people will stop leasing land to futsal grounds in Kathmandu because the prices are too high. I see a future when most of the futsal courts in Kathmandu will relocate away from the valley,” says Bhusal.
Maharjan feels that this will happen sooner than later. His family have been pressuring him to sell the land where he is running Dhuku Futsal Hub.
“I’ve convinced them how bad a decision that would be,” he says.
That said, he does feel that maybe the business of futsal in Nepal will feel the pressure as the books will stop balancing in the long run. He argues that businesses are offering their services for cheap. With the competition now extremely unhealthy as most refuse to set a standard price, Maharjan feels most will definitely shut down as operating costs continue to go up.
“When businesses start to shut down, the price will automatically go up,” says Maharjan.
But, Bhusal sees things differently. He feels that most businesses will move to the outskirts of the valley where land is cheap.
Both say that the government has failed to capitalise on the sport. The Futsal League that took place in 2022 did the sport a lot of good and a team even took part in the Asian Futsal Cup qualifiers.
But that was that and after that, nothing much has been done. Consequently, the national futsal team’s captain and star player Anish Shrestha quit.
“The league was important for futsal in Nepal getting a positive image, but more needs to happen.”
When asked if unofficial leagues could take place in the valley, both Bhusal and Maharjan say not everyone shares the same sentiment.
“People here aren’t as passionate as I am. Most don’t want to spend time creating a team as they feel it’s an expense. They don’t see the bigger picture,” says Maharjan.

Sandeep Lamichhane rape charge: CAN lifts suspension hours after govt attorney takes the case to apex court,"Wednesday, February 1, 2023","Kathmandu, February 1
Nepal’s cricket governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), has lifted the suspension of former national cricket team captain Sandeep Lamichhane.
A meeting of the CAN central committee on Tuesday night made the decision in Pokhara. Coincidentally, the decision comes on the same day the government attorney filed an application at the Supreme Court, demanding Lamichhane be taken back to judicial custody until the trial over a rape charge filed against him gets concluded.
Lamichhane is facing a charge of raping a minor in August 2022. After a complaint was filed against him with the police in September, CAN suspended him from the role.
The next month he was arrested by police and sent to judicial custody following a preliminary hearing by the Kathmandu District Court. Nonetheless, based on an appeal filed by Lamichhane, the Patan High Court released him on bail in January.
Following the release, his supporters and fans were piling pressure on CAN to lift the suspension.

"‘Not as easy as you think, sports commentary awaits glamour in Nepal’","Wednesday, February 1, 2023","Avash Ghimire’s first football commentary was during the 2019 South Asian Games. He was thrown in at the deep end when asked to comment on a game between Bhutan and Bangladesh. He was nervous as this was a big stage.
But, this had been his dream. For years, he had projected himself as a commentator. The time had come and he was not going to let it slip.
“I made a few mistakes but I felt a high I’d never felt before. After that match, there was no going back,” says Ghimire.
Since then, Avash Ghimire has been regularly commentating on games. He has commentated on the track and field events at the South Asian Games. He was also a part of the team that commentated on the inaugural futsal league along with knockout football tournaments, cricket games, international football games and the A Division League.
Having learnt most of it on the job, Ghimire feels it is time that TV channels realised the importance of live sports. Despite his best efforts, he feels people still take commentators for granted and wants people to understand what they are doing is not as easy as many think.
That said, he wants to continue to grow as a commentator and hopes to pave way for the future generation and become the voice of football in the country and bring glamour to the live broadcasts.
Avash Ghimire’s love for commentary started at a young age while watching cricket with his father on television. He loved listening to Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri and enacted them when he played cricket with his friends.
When he was growing up, football commentary in Nepal was done mostly by Sanjeeb Shilpakar who he looked up to a lot. He listened to how he did it and always hoped he makes it there one day.
“Sanjeeb dai and Aman (Adhikary) dai have been my role models here in Nepal. Having worked with both has been a dream come true for me,” he says.
To pave his way, he joined the media industry. His goal was to learn and get better and become a commentator. He hosted and produced various shows, but his end goal was always commentary.
Avash Ghimire’s first stint as a commentator was during the first edition of the Pokhara Premier League in 2018. He was hired to be the host of the tournament, but knowing his interest was commentary, Aman Pratap Adhikary, the broadcast director of the tournament, gave him the microphone for five overs.
“He’s believed in me a lot and giving me those five overs was of great help.”
Ghimire then carried on doing things on YouTube and producing shows for Nepali media. But in 2019, when he was watching the South Asian Games, he felt sad hearing the commentary.
“It was being done by an amateur. Apparently, someone who was supposed to be there hadn’t arrived on time and someone else was filling in,” he says.
Avash Ghimire called Yopesh Pradhan, the broadcast director, and asked him why he was not considered for the role. Pradhan asked him to come to the Dasharath Stadium and that is how he got his first chance at doing football commentary.
But being thrown in at the deep end was not easy. This was something he calls the hardest thing he has done in his life. He made mistakes. There was no chance he would not have as this was his first time doing it. But, he did not hesitate and completed the entire match on his own.
“After that, I and Abhinav (Joshi) did the rest of the tournament together.”
That started a series of other tournaments. Avash Ghimire did the 2022 A Division League along with the very first futsal league. But, it has not been smooth sailing.
“Commentary is the hardest thing I’ve done in my life. It taught me a lot about the game and about how I should be doing it.”
As a commentator, the best make mistakes and so has he. He sometimes has got too emotional during Nepal’s games and has to be told to calm down. He has made mistakes when it comes to calling the match and has used terminologies that a Nepali audience does not understand. But, he feels most of the criticism is unfair as he is trying to pave the way for the future.
“There was a gap because of this discouragement. I feel I now have developed a thick skin and have been dealing with the criticism quite well.”
But, what does not help Avash Ghimire is terminologies. Football is a foreign game and the most of words when translated into Nepali do not make much sense. To ensure he does not confuse people, he uses English words but the audience always trolls him for doing so.
“I think people don’t realise I can’t use some words that do not make sense. Maybe with time, they will become accustomed to it,” he says.
Another issue that commentators like him face is the place from where they commentate on the game. Stadiums in Europe have a place called the gantry, a vantage point from where commentators see the game. But in Nepal, no stadium has a gantry as the country’s only international stadium forces commentators to commentate on the game from a room that is below the ground.
“We have to commentate looking at the TV screen. That’s not easy. We did get to do it from the stands during the Aaha Rara Gold Cup in Pokhara, but at Dasharath Stadium, we haven’t had that freedom,” he says.
This means they can not see the game as well as a commentator should, which makes it tough for them to explain what is going on in the game. For this to change, Avash Ghimire feels TV Channels need to understand what commentators need.
“They think it’s a simple job of coming and speaking but there’s more to this. This, along with reality shows, is what will hold the TV in the future and they need to understand.”
But, Avash Ghimire feels most TV channels take them for granted. They do not give them time to do their homework and pay them well below what they are worth.
“Most of us do it because it’s our passion. Now, we need to move ahead and bring glamour to the industry and make it better. I’m trying my best to try to change things, but Nepal is a difficult place to create change,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/avash-ghimire-football-commentator.html,sports
"Nepal T20 League controversy: 7 CAN members demand President Chand, Secretary Malla resign","Sunday, January 29, 2023","Kathmandu, January 29
Seven central committee members of the national cricket governing body, Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), have demanded resignations from CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand and Acting Secretary Prashant Bikram Malla among five over the Nepal T20 League spot-fixing controversy.
Organising a press conference on Sunday, members Rishi Raj Gautam, Daud Ansari, Sanjaya Raj Singh, Karan Mahatara Chhetri, Amit Bir Pandey, Chhumbi Lama and Dharma Raj Giri demanded resignations from Chand, Malla, Treasurer Roshan Singh and members Durga Raj Pathak and Padam Khadka.
The dissidents say the CAN leadership team made a mistake by assigning the Indian company, Seven3Sports, to manage the league.
“Generally, organisations rarely get involved in spot-fixing, but here the partner company has been into fixing,” the dissidents say in a statement, “Therefore, the CAN leadership cannot skip from the spot-fixing charge.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-t20-league-can-dissidents.html,sports
Monty Desai begins working as the Nepal cricket coach without formal appointment,"Sunday, January 29, 2023","Kathmandu, January 29
Monty Desai has begun working as the head coach of the Nepal national cricket team without obtaining a formal appointment.
As the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) announced a 28-member preliminary squad for a tri-series against Namibia and Scotland under the ICC World Cup Cricket League 2 on Friday, Desai began coaching them at the TU cricket ground, Kirtipur.
As the appointment process got entangled in a complicated bureaucratic procedure taking a longer than expected time, CAN decided to begin working with him as an expert for now.
The CAN recommendation to pick Desai as the coach has reached the National Sports Council now, and a formal decision would be made by the Ministry of Youth and Sports.
“But, we don’t have enough time to wait for the formal appointment,” CAN Manager Binod Das says, “The sessions happening now can’t be considered official training either.”

CAN recommends Monty Desai as Nepal cricket coach,"Friday, January 27, 2023","Kathmandu, January 27
The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has nominated Monty Desai to be the new coach of the men’s national team.
CAN has sent the file recommending Desai to be the head coach to National Sports Council (NSC). But the file has not been sent to the Sports Ministry which needs to give CAN approval to hire him.
The position of head coach has been vacant after Manoj Prabhakar resigned as the head coach of the men’s cricket team following a series of poor results.
With the team due to play a home series of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 in two weeks, no head coach means the team are yet to be called to a closed camp.
“We have chosen the right candidate and it is up to the NSC and ministry to do its job,” says CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand stating the board was worried about the team’s recent performances in League 2.
NSC’s Chandra Rai says the due procedure is being followed and after completion, the file will be sent to the ministry.
The series against Namibia and Scotland will be held at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur from February 14.
Nepal currently have 18 points and are in the sixth place only above Papua New Guinea with eight wins in 24 games. League 2 was Nepal’s only chance at direct entry into the global qualifiers of the World Cup that is due to take place in India in October. But, given the performance of the team, that door has closed now.

Nepal’s Aasif Sheikh has won the ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2022.
The global cricket governing body, International Cricket Council, announced the winner in a statement on Thursday.
Sheikh is the first Nepali player to win the award.
The ICC says the award recognises “his decision not to run out Andy McBrine after the Irish star tripped while attempting a run” during a match in February 2022.
Nepal and Ireland faced off in the sixth match of the Quadrangular series in Oman on February 14, 2022.
ICC defines the “spirit of cricket” in the statement, “Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its laws but also within the spirit of the game.

Nepal footballers’ Australian dream challenges the sport’s future,"Thursday, January 26, 2023","When newly promoted A division club, Church Boys United signed national team defender Dinesh Rajbanshi and midfielder Tej Tamang, they had high hopes from the Nepal football sector.
The club wanted to make an instant impact in the league by associating the two players who had been regular in the national team for the past five years.
The two, who played for a big club like Manang Marsyangdi, signed after they were offered a monthly salary in excess of Rs 100,000. But before the club could announce the two had signed, Rajbanshi and Tamang were on a flight to Australia.
On the same day as the two left Nepal, defender Gautam Shrestha also left for Australia. A few days later, midfielder Nitin Thapa and striker Ranjan Bista also left. Thapa had signed for Sankata Club, Thapa for Khumaltar and Bista had renewed his contract with New Road Team.
The trend of Nepali footballers leaving the country has risen. In the last year alone, around 35 footballers have left the country. This, on the eve of the new season starting, is bad news, say experts, who feel the Nepal football sector is on a downward spiral.
“The players that have been doing well leaving the country during the prime of their career is quite disheartening. We need to find out why this is happening,” says football analyst Sanjeeb Mishra.
Mishra believes that the players are looking for another way to sustain their lives. This, he feels, is not wrong as football in Nepal is semi-professional and the players have not been able to earn enough to sustain themselves by playing football alone.
But, Mishra feels the players have not been able to trust themselves or their ability
“It’s sad to see that they’ve left the country using the game that gave him an identity. It’s like they don’t believe in themselves,” Mishra says. “Yes, they will earn a lot. However, that money surely won’t give them the satisfaction that would come from performing for their country.”
Jagjit Shrestha was in the prime of his career in 2016 when he decided to leave Nepal to go to Australia. Following him, Shulab Maskey, Heman Gurung and Alan Neupane also went to Australia. Having seen them do well in Australia, many other members of the Nepal football team followed suit.
If you take the 20 players participating in the South Asian Game’s U-23 team that won a gold medal in 2019, eight have left Nepal for Australia.
Dinesh Rajbanshi, Suman Aryal, Mikchhen Tamang, Hemanta Thapa Magar, Nitn Thapa, Tej Tamang and Abhishek Rijal are not in Nepal. Most of these players were substitutes for the national team, some had become regular starters.
Suman Lama, Ashish Lama, Darshan Gurung and Sajog Rai are also not in Nepal. Gurung had become a hero after scoring Nepal’s first goal against Kuwait in 40 years during the Asian Cup Qualifiers.
Lama, who made his debut with the national team against Sri Lanka in 2016, has 22 caps. Suman Aryal, who made his debut against Pakistan in 2018, has 26 caps. Dinesh Rajbanshi, who made his debut against Yemen, has 24 caps and Abhishek Rijal, who made his debut against Malaysia in 2019, has 12 caps. Similarly, Tej Tamang, Santosh Tamang and Ashish Lama who have 24, 16 and six caps respectively were seen as the future of the Nepal football team.
Nepal’s former coach Abdullah Al Mutairi handed debuts to 15 players during his nearly two-year tenure when Nepal played 20 games.
Gautam Shrestha, Akash Budha Magar, Shiva Gurung and Rajan Gurung, who got a chance during this period, did not see a future in Nepal and left for Australia.
The future of Nepal football leaving the country is bad news as national team regulars like Bishal Shrestha, Rohit Chand, Kiran Chemjong and Sujal Shrestha are in the latter half of their careers. This trend will disturb the balance of club football, which will have a negative impact on the national team too, say experts.
Football coach Meghraj KC says when the generation prepared by years of investment leaves the country, a crisis can arise.
“If we only played domestic football, this is not an issue as others will take their place. But as we play internationally, these players leaving creates a huge vacuum,” says KC.
KC says the past three years have been quite bad for the Nepal football sector resulting in the players giving up entirely.
After the A Division League and knockout tournaments concluded in 2019, football was at a standstill due to the Covid pandemic. In 2020, no football activity took place. The league happened again in 2021 as did various knockout tournaments across the country.
But these are not enough for footballers to sustain themselves playing a sport they love, argues KC. According to data, Nepal footballers were only involved in the game for 10 months in the past three years. This means players were only paid for those 10 months.
“When you don’t have other means to put food on the table, they have to think about alternatives. I won’t be surprised if more leave,” says KC.
Jagjit Shrestha left Nepal in 2016 for similar reasons. Football activities had gone down following the 2015 earthquake and he stopped seeing a future in the Nepal football sector.
“When it’s hard to fulfil your basic needs, you stop seeing a future in a sport,” says Shrestha. “We hardly get to play there and there is no set footballing calendar. Inflation is on the rise every year, yet our pay doesn’t change. I don’t blame players leaving the country.”
Sankata Club President Indra Man Tuladhar sees the need to look at this problem from the perspective of the players.
“It’s safe to say that the lifestyle and social security in Australia are miles better than in Nepal. The players feel they have a better future there,” says Tuladhar. “The Australian government loosening its immigration rules has also helped these players.”
Most of the Nepal footballers have reached Australia on subclass 400 temporary work visas. This is a short-term work permit given to skilled personnel of a special nature. Those going to Australia on this visa cannot do anything else other than what’s specified on the visa.
However, according to Australia’s immigration policy, those who come in this way can change their visa type and get a student visa, so the attraction of the players is more, says Chiranjeevi Devkota, the president of the Australian Nepalese Journalists Association. None of the footballers who have gone from Nepal can join the competitions or clubs under the professional football pyramid there. Apart from Jagjit Shrestha, all other footballers play in community competitions.
“There are dozens of competitions organised by the Nepali community in Australia during the weekends. The number of clubs is huge too. These clubs bring the Nepal footballers to come to play for their teams,” says Devkota from Melbourne.
Behind these community competitions is the Australian Nepalese Football Association (ANFA), registered 12 years ago in New South Wales, Australia. The association has been looking after Nepal footballing activities there ever since.
Raju Manandhar, who was the president of the organisation from 2013 to 2018, admits that players are coming from Nepal in coordination with clubs playing in the Nepali Community League.
“Around 2,500 Nepali players from New South Wales are registered in our organisation. There are 12 clubs playing in the Premier League, 10 clubs in the Minor League and six clubs in the Veterans League,” says Manandhar. “There is a game every Sunday. Players’ fees and cash prizes are also arranged accordingly.”
According to him, the Premier League, which is the top division, operates for six months.
Now, most of the Nepal footballers who are in Australia under the sponsorship of the clubs founded by Nepalis have changed their visas. Manandhar says if they get a student visa and complete the course there, it will be easy for them to get permanent residence in the future.
With one player after another leaving for Australia, it has become difficult for the Nepali football clubs to form a team before the A division league.
Football’s season started a month ago with various knockout competitions and the A division league is due to start on March 3. As the date for the league is nearing, players tied with the clubs are leaving the country.
Ruben Rai, the president of Church Boys United, says all Nepal football teams are facing problems due to this.
“The only way we can stop this is by giving out large salaries or creating a change from the ground up. It’s not something our club or All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) can do alone,” says Rai.
But, football analyst Mishra says that the responsible bodies and individuals are not interested to create a change.
“More will leave before the season starts because those in leadership roles in the government and the governing body are not doing anything about it. It’s like they don’t care,” says Mishra.
Mishra is right as the country’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), does not have a concrete plan to stop the exodus of players. So far, it has not even collected the data of the players who have gone abroad.
“It’s their personal choice,” says Dawa Tamang, the ANFA vice president. “We can’t go to the airport and stop them from leaving, can we?”
Tamang says he does not believe that it is hard for Nepal footballers to sustain themselves in the country. On the contrary, he says that the players are highly ambitious and opt to leave the country. “I don’t think it will be solved unless the government does something. ANFA can’t do anything,” says Dawa.
He does nonetheless admit ANFA’s regular and long-term planning and implementation are weak. But he says that ANFA is aware of the issue and is serious about it.
“We want to produce players from the grassroots and work by making a long-term plan. We will discuss this in the working committee and develop a system, which will develop the players in a manner in which they won’t have to think about going abroad,” he says.

Fabiano Flora: How this Portuguese coach sees hopes for Nepal football in little Kathmandu kids,"Wednesday, January 25, 2023","On a lukewarm winter afternoon, UFEA pro licence coach Fabiano Flora is putting 43 children through their paces at St Xavier School’s football ground in Lalitpur, a part of the Kathmandu valley. After giving the children aged between six and 16 a theory class, he keenly observes if they are doing what he has taught them.
Dividing them into three groups based on their age, Flora instructs the students to follow what they have been taught. He wants them to use the wide spaces before building attacks. When the kids do what he has asked them to do, his face lights up like a proud father watching his children.
“There are kids who have the potential to be great, but we need to be patient with them,” says Flora.
Fabiano Flora conducted a two-week football camp between January 9 and 20 where he taught them the fundamental basics of sports. The aim of the football camp was to strengthen the foundations of the children and equip them with the skills and techniques needed to succeed at the top level. Through this, he hopes, more camps like these are held by the government or the governing body, which in turn will help in the development of grassroots football in the future.
“If the base is not great, there is no way football will improve,” he says.
For Fabiano Flora, the children, until they are 14, must pay full attention to skill, coordination and agility. This, he believes, will help them in the long run. But, to do that, the children should be put through drills to develop muscle memories, which they will use during in-game situations.
To ensure they get that, he took an hour-long theory class every day where he discussed what they would be doing. The first week was spent on first touches and passing while the next week was spent on shooting, dribbling and other in-game scenarios.
“They need to learn how to use spaces during the game. We also discussed how to take advantage of situations like 2v1, 3v2 etc. The kids seemed to get it,” says Fabiano Flora.
But, he believes that they need to have the mental fitness to continue to work too if they want to keep on progressing.
For their progress, camps like these are essential, he says. These camps teach them more than just kicking the ball. It also teaches them brotherhood and the importance of teamwork.
“More camps like this will make them better and that will make the national team better,” says Flora.
The youth football camp project has been in pipeline since the pandemic, says Dipesh Ghaley, the founder of Periwinkle Services, a marketing, branding and promotion company that invited Flora to come to Nepal to conduct the camp.
Having been involved in football, Ghaley always wanted to do something for the grassroots. He had seen young children undergo training in different futsal areas, which gave him the idea to conduct a rigorous camp.
“Kids don’t have a place to go take training to get better. For our football team to get better, these camps are necessary and that is what we wanted to show,” says Ghaley.
For that, Ghaley was looking for a coach who understood how to coach young children and through his contacts in the United Kingdom found Fabiano Flora.
“His record is great. He’s a pro licence holder who’s been involved in youth football for nearly a decade. He’s a top professional who’s been amazing,” says Ghaley.
Flora is not an alien to Asian football either. He has been around South East Asia and has been involved with teams in Myanmar and East Timor. Comparing the children in Asia to those in Europe, Flora feels these children deserve a good foundation as the quality, culture and skills are different in Europe compared to Asia.
“The foundation here is weak. There’s no infrastructure and the grounds are poor,” he says.
Helping Fabiano Flora during the camp were coaches from Nepali clubs. One of them was Prabesh Katwal, the interim head coach of Nepal’s national team. For Katwal, this was an opportunity to learn under a UEFA coach and says he has learnt a lot from Flora.
Katwal says Flora’s experience and his way of doing things, especially his planning and the manner in which he treats the young children, is entirely different to what is happening in Nepal.
“It’s the same drills, but the way of doing it is what stood out. Small things make a big difference,” says Katwal.
Katwal feels fortunate to be part of such a camp and feels Nepali football would benefit a lot if similar camps could be held regularly, especially in a densely populated area like Kathmandu.
“If you see our national team, it doesn’t have players from Kathmandu. These camps would change that and help us create players from the valley,” says Katwal, “It would improve players’ technique too and would be great if we could take it away from Kathmandu to other cities too.”
But that is a farfetched dream for now. Ghaley knows this as he has had no help from the country’s football governing body, ANFA, as the entire programme was done solely by him and Periwinkle.
“We want to do more camps like this in the future too.”
Fabiano Flora believes camps like these are only the start and that a country like Nepal needs reform in football starting with a proper plan and investment.
“These kids need proper facilities like training centres, academies and more games. They also need better grounds to play football along with better coaches,” says Flora.
He believes the country should also invest in coaches and give them foreign exposure as they will come in handy in the future.
“Like players, coaches need to learn too and that is what Nepal needs to do if it wants to improve its football team,” Fabiano Flora says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fabiano-flora-youth-football-nepal.html,sports

The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has announced the dates for the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 series against Namibia and Scotland. The series will be held at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur from February 14.
With the first match of the series less than a month away, CAN has still not filled the position of the cricket team’s head coach which has been vacant since Manoj Prabhakar resigned following a series of poor results.
The 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 is the first edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, a cricket tournament which forms a part of the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualification process. The tournament is being played from August 2019 to February 2023, with all matches played as one-day internationals (ODIs).
Nepal currently have 18 points and are in the sixth place only above Papua New Guinea with eight wins in 24 games. League 2 was Nepal’s only chance at direct entry into the global qualifiers of the World Cup that is due to take place in India in October. But, given the performance of the team, that door has closed now.
Nepal’s poor performance in League 2 also means that they are likely to lose ODI status.

"Nepal T20 League: Mired in controversy, how an ambitious project spoiled Nepal cricket’s global image","Tuesday, January 17, 2023","Nepal T20 League, which has been mired in one controversy after another, had its first champion: Lumbini All Stars. But, this tournament has not only exposed the managerial inability of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), but it has also destroyed the image of Nepal as an emerging cricketing country as experts fear that the loss will be huge if the spot-fixing allegations are true.
When Chatur Bahadur Chand became the CAN president, one of the main goals of his central committee was to host an official T20 league tournament in Nepal. The reason? The popularity of T20 cricket was on the rise and it was also a good means to raise funds for the development of cricket in the country. For that, CAN envisioned the Nepal T20 League.
The league, however, became controversial and opaque from the start. It started by giving the league to an Indian company Seven3Sports.
The idea came up during CAN’s annual general meeting in 2020. The plan was to sell the rights of the league to the company for the next 10 years and get around Rs 420 million for it.
This was too cheap. As the move was criticised both inside and outside CAN, Chand backtracked from the idea. But, he had already signed a preliminary agreement with Seven3Sports, so he could not cancel it entirely either.
The coronavirus pandemic meant all sporting activities were put on hold and Seven3Sports did not put pressure on Chand and CAN either. But as soon as the pandemic subsided, CAN announced Seven3Sports as Nepal T20 League’s strategic and commercial partner.
The league started obscurely as CAN did not give clear information about the franchise teams, prize money or sponsors. CAN held a press conference on the eve of the tournament and announced a subsidiary of a betting site 1XBet, 1XBat, as the official sponsor of the tournament and stated the prize money for the tournament would be around Rs 12.5 million.
This raised a lot of eyebrows as the league did not have any other sponsor other than the betting company. Many were questioning how Seven3Sports would pay for the prize money and the additional Rs 39 million it had to pay CAN.
The controversy increased when Nepal T20 League started on December 24, 2022. The first issue was that of work permits as many foreigners played without obtaining one. A few days later, allegations were made about the league being a target of spot-fixers.
As people started to question if the spot-fixing was taking place during the league, Seven3Sports co-founder Jatin Ahluwalia disappeared and fled to India.
Chand confirmed that Ahluwalia had fled and stated that CAN was looking to terminate the contract with him.
The very next day, on January 3, players from Kathmandu Knights and Biratnagar Super Kings refused to take the field stating they had not received their salaries for their games in the Nepal T20 League. After talking with CAN, the players agreed to play the match. Following the match, Kathmandu Knights captain Gyanendra Malla even said some of his players were approached by people to fix matches.
Coincidently, that was the day when Biratnagar Super Kings changed their captain. The team, until January 3, was captained by West Indian Andre McCarthy, but the team replaced him with Rohit Paudel, who also captains Nepal’s national team.
Biratnagar had chosen Paudel as their captain initially before McCarthy was chosen but, on the eve of the Nepal T20 League, they withdrew from it, which raised eyebrows everywhere.
The reputation of the league took another hit when commentator Sachin Timalsina posted a video on Facebook telling the world how he saw instances of spot-fixing during the tournament.
That caused an uproar as people called the government to investigate the league and the allegations of spot-fixing. Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane then instructed Nepal Police to investigate the case. National Sports Council also formed a task force to investigate the case as a team of officials from the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) anti-corruption unit (ACU) came to Nepal after being reported about the incident.
The ICC has not given its verdict yet, but CIB’s preliminary reports suggest at least three Nepali and four foreign players were involved in spot-fixing.
CIB sources claim that people connected with Seven3Sports were working as agents to fix the games in the Nepal T20 League. Many believe Ahluwalia fled to India to avoid the investigation.
Chand, however, says he is in constant talks with Ahluwalia.
“He’s said he’s managing funds that Seven3Sports owes us,” says Chand.
CAN officials, from the beginning, had been stating that CAN is the organiser of the Nepal T20 League and Seven3Sports was only the commercial and strategic partner. But, when the tournament started, Ahluwalia and Seven3Sports started calling the shots.
“The way Seven3Sports was handed the contract was wrong. We’re seeing its impact now,” says former captain LB Chhetri, who had been questioning the contract with Seven3Sports from the start.
He is right as CAN told one lie after another to cover up the mistake in the initial agreement. Seven3Sports took advantage of it and things started to get worse for both the league and CAN.
The situation was so dire that there was no transparency about who owned the Nepal T20 League teams. Many players say never met the team owners.
The worst was when Kathmandu Knights, owned by Nepal Sports Ventures, did not even have a team manager, coach or foreign players when they played the eliminator against Biratnagar Super Kings.
Players from Biratnagar Superkings and Janakpur Royals, owned by Diamond Digicap Sports Private Limited and Gold Sports Private Limited respectively, say they did not get the expected treatment from the management.
Players from Farwest United, who were eliminated from the league stage of the Nepal T20 League, have said they did not get a single penny for playing in the tournament. The team is owned by SS Events and Ventures, a consortium based in the United Kingdom.
Only two teams seem to have been fair to their players — Pokhara Avengers and Lumbini All Stars who paid their players on time.
As per the agreement CAN signed with Seven3Sports, the latter is responsible for giving all the prizes for the tournament. Lumbini All Stars, who defeated Biratnagar Super Kings by 24 runs in the final, should get Rs 5.5 million while the runners-up are due to get Rs 3 million.
CAN says Seven3Sports will hand out this prize along with one for the best batter, bowler and emerging player. People are unsure if they will get the money as those who won the player of the match during the Nepal T20 League events are yet to get prize money.
Chand believes that Seven3Sports will hand over the prize money sooner or later. But, when asked the date for the handover of the prize money, Chand has no answer.
“The contract doesn’t say by when they need to give the prize money,” says Chand. “He (Ahluwalia) said he’s trying to raise money. Everyone will get what they are owed.”
CAN itself has not got the money it is owed. Out of the Rs 39 million, CAN is still to receive Rs 17 million from Seven3Sports. As it wants this money, CAN has not been able to terminate the contract yet.
“We will hold a board meeting to see what we need to do in the future. This decision was made during the AGM so I think we should take the final decision then,” says Chand. “I think the Nepal T20 League was a success even though there were some issues. Now we should look forward and think about how we can improve it.”
That said, this tournament is proof that CAN cannot hold a major tournament in Nepal.
“This tournament was a failure and they (CAN) need to accept it,” says former captain Chhetri. “A lot of people have sacrificed so much to take Nepali cricket to this height. But I’m worried that tournaments like the Nepal T20 League will kill Nepali cricket altogether.”

Will Sandeep Lamichhane be back on the pitch? CAN says it’s consulting experts,"Friday, January 13, 2023","Kathmandu, January 13
The national cricket body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), says it has begun consultations regarding whether to include rape-accused former national team captain Sandeep Lamichhane back in the team.

Manjushree Trail Race: Story behind the birth and growth of Nepal’s only one certified 100-miler,"Friday, January 13, 2023","When a group of Nepali runners started assisting foreigners who ran the Kathmandu valley rim, a 100-mile-long trail that goes around the hills surrounding Kathmandu valley, around 2018, little did they know that they were sowing the seeds for one of the toughest races in the country.
These runners ran with trail runners like Lizzy Hawker and Seth Wolpin and developed a liking for long-distance running. After years of being pacers, in 2021, a few wanted to run the trail themselves and the Manjushree Trail Race was born.
It is the only International Trail Running Association (ITRA)-certified 100-mile trail race in Nepal.
“I wanted to do it in one go like others so I approached a few friends like Jimmi Oostrum who suggested organising a race and that started it all,” says trail runner Jeevan Lama, the winner of the first edition of the race held in the summer of 2021.
Only seven people ran the Manjushree Trail Race in 2021, but the team knew that the race had potential and they were right as the next year saw 36 people run the 100 miles and nearly 100 took part in other events of the race.
Now, the team is gearing up for the third edition as it hopes this one will be bigger and better. The team aims to ensure that it becomes one of the premier races not just in Nepal but also in Asia.
“It’s going to take time, but we want it to be a reason why people come to Nepal,” says Ashish Mishra, one of the team members of the race.
The first person to run the Kathmandu valley rim loop, in November 2015, was Seth Wolpin. After Wolpin, Lizzy Hawker completed her first loop in March 2016. Following them, Simon Castro, Jocelyn Powelson and Raj Pradhan did the loop in March 2018. It was around then the idea to create a race started brewing in the minds of Nepali runners.
Even though the idea started then, work did not begin until 2020 when the country went into a Covid lockdown. The team says as the restrictive measure were in place, most of them started to run the trails around the valley to get fresh air.
Hawker had taken Rashila Tamang as her pacer in 2018 and told her the trail might be useful for her for training purposes. But, there were issues with the complete loop and that was an issue for them.
“When I ran with Lizzy, we ran most of it on road and that wasn’t fun. That is why in 2020, we set off looking for alternatives to the roads because we wanted the race to have more trails as possible,” says Tamang, who is also a part of the Manjushree Trail Race team.
As they started circumambulating the trail, their concept started to get broader and in 2021, they decided to mark the trail permanently, which would not only help them during the race but also people who enjoyed hiking or cycling.
“We wanted people to feel what Manjushree, a Tibetan saint and ruler who believed to have visited Kathmandu and drained the water from a big lake here to establish a valley, did when he walked around the valley. That is why we named the race in his honour,” says Mishra.
The Manjushree Trail Race route takes runners along the Kathmandu valley rim ridge line and across the seven peaks that surround the valley – Jamacho, Shivapuri, Nagarkot, Phulchoki, Champadevi, Bhasmasur and Chandragiri. It covers 175.18 km, with an incline of 12,695 metres across the seven peaks.
“Over 85 per cent of the route is on the trail, most of which is in the jungles. Even though you’re still within the Kathmandu valley, you will feel like you are far away from urbanisation many times during the race,” says Mishra. “Runners encounter dense forests and the occasional view of Nepal’s capital from the exposed ridges and peaks.”
Manjushree Trail Race is also the only race in Nepal to which the ITRA has given six points. “This means anyone who wants to enter the UTMB lottery can come and run the race. It’s an opportunity for us to ensure many people take part in it. Great for tourism too,” says Mishra.
After the first year, the team also decided to put in other events on the race. As running a 100-mile race is not for anyone, the team, from 2022 onwards, included 21km, 50km and 50-mile races.
“We get many people running shorter distances and we’ve also applied for ITRA points for these races,” says Tamang.
When asked if it can be a part of an international event like the UTMB in the future, the team says it is a long shot as the government needs to be involved for the same.
Annapurna 100, a 100-km race held in Nepal, was a part of an international event like the Golden Trail Series in 2019. But following that, Golden Trail Series stopped coming to Nepal, which is disappointing as continuing it would have been great for the Manjushree Trail Race, the sport of running and for the country’s tourism, says the team.
“All the top runners take part in these international events, which are watched by millions of people. We missed something there,” says Mishra.
The Majushree Trail Race team hopes that the government will come on board as it needs governmental help. For now, the event has been done with help from the supporters and sponsors but for the race to reach the next level, it needs the government’s support.
“We’ve been to Nepal Tourism Board to talk about this, but they didn’t take it seriously. Maybe they will in the future,” says Mishra.
Another challenge has been maintaining the trails. Due to unplanned development, most of the trails the team has marked have turned into roads along with the locals making concrete steps on parts of the trail.
“This is a major challenge because it kills the beauty of the trail,” says Lama.
He says one of the aims of the Manjushree Trail Race is to spread the message about saving trails around the valley that have disappeared in recent times. The team feels saving the Kathmandu valley rim could be an important step in that as it joins all the prominent peaks of the valley.
“We also want the Manjushree Trail Race to be a platform for the future generation. Everyone comes to Kathmandu and having a race like this here is great for the sport as it gives us chance to see the younger generation test themselves against the best,” says Tamang, who feels the race can be good for training for races abroad too.

"Nepal T20 League: CIB says 3 Nepali, 4 foreign players involved in spot-fixing","Sunday, January 8, 2023","Kathmandu, January 8
The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has made a preliminary conclusion that there has been spot-fixing in the Nepal T20 League organised by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).
News of spot-fixing and match-fixing has dominated the league.
Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, on January 3, instructed the CIB to investigate the case.
According to the preliminary investigation, three Nepali and four foreign players have been found to be involved in spot-fixing.
A CIB source says there is evidence that the Seven3Sports, the commercial and strategic partner of the Nepal T20 League, was involved in spot-fixing.
Fearing he would be caught in all this, Jatin Ahluwalia, the co-founder of Seven3Sports, fled Nepal on January 2. Following that, CAN said that it would start the process of terminating the contract with the company.
But, contrary to reports, CAN, has said that spot-fixing has not taken place during the tournament.
The CIB has taken statements from the suspected players. A source says the report suggests the first few matches of the tournaments were fixed but after news of fixing broke out, the players stopped indulging themselves in spot-fixing.
According to the source, it was found in the investigation that a player took less than Rs 1 million for spot-fixing in a match.

Taekwondo in Nepal is losing its force as players choose migration over medals,"Sunday, January 8, 2023","Bhupen Shrestha was only 19 when he won a gold medal during the 13th South Asian Games (SAG) in 2019. Shrestha, who was physically strong and technically agile, was seen as the future of taekwondo in Nepal.
There were valid reasons for people to be hopeful as he had won a gold medal in just two years of training. He was taekwondo’s golden boy and many had hoped he would make the country proud. But a little over four months ago, Shrestha decided to leave his gold medal behind and fly to Australia looking for a better future.
“I thought I’d get more exposure and better facilities after I won an international gold. But contrary to that, I didn’t even receive regular training. The (Nepal Taekwondo) Association didn’t treat me like an international athlete,” says Shrestha.
This is not just the case for Shrestha. Out of the 34 players of taekwondo in Nepal who won medals at the 13th South Asian Games in 2019 December, 13 have left the country for a better future abroad.
This shows how terrible the state of taekwondo in Nepal is as many promising players who have done well and won medals in international tournaments have left the country after not seeing a future in the sport.
Many say the situation is going to get worse as the officials associated with taekwondo in Nepal are currently in an internal tussle, which has caused uncertainty for those who have dedicated their lives to the sport.
What has not helped is the move by the National Sports Council (NSC) that scraped the Nepal Taekwondo Association and formed the Nepal Taekwondo Federation two weeks ago.
Bitterness started between the Olympic-recognised Nepal Taekwondo Association and NSC in September 2021. Nepal Taekwondo Association has not been happy with the NSC’s leadership when it formed another association called the Taekwondo Union in 2011. Things got worse between the two when the Nepal Taekwondo Association went ahead with its annual general meeting and elections in spite of the NSC asking it not to.
The association held a general meeting in Bhairahawa on September 30, 2021. Three days before that, the NSC had instructed to postpone the election because it did not approve the association’s revised constitution.
Nepal Taekwondo Association did not stop the general meeting saying that the election process had started after dissolving the working committee, and a new working committee was elected with Prakash Shamsher Rana as the president. But the NSC did not recognise the new working committee led by Rana.
This controversy flared up when competitions started to be conducted for the development of taekwondo in Nepal. Aiming at the upcoming Asian Games, the NSC directed the head coach Naveen Kumar Shrestha to start the training of the national team in October 2021. But the working committee led by Rana did not allow the chief coach Shrestha to train according to the NSC’s plan.
Instead, without coordinating with the head coach and trainer, they formed a national team preparation sub-committee under the leadership of Ram Giri and organised the 17th National Taekwondo Tournament on April 1 and 2, 2022. This meant the training of the national team of taekwondo in Nepal could not start.
The NSC then held a two-month closed camp from May 2022  for the Asian Games. In the camp, the NSC called players who won medals in the 2019 SAG and those who had performed in national-level taekwondo tournaments.
Asian Games was postponed to September 2023 and the closed camp was halted for the time being.
The 113th board meeting of the NSC held in July 2022 decided to form a committee under the leadership of its vice-chairperson Shiva Koirala. The aim of the committee was to solve issues related to sports associations.
Interestingly, Koirala is also the president of the National Taekwondo Union. This is the same union that was registered by the National Sports Council, which caused controversy in taekwondo in Nepal.
Nepal Taekwondo Association did not accept Koirala as the coordinator of the dispute resolution committee. According to the committee, the leadership of the Nepal Taekwondo Association did not come to the discussion despite being called for several times. The committee hence recommended the cancellation of the registration. On December 10, 2022, Sports Minister Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj endorsed the recommendation of the committee.
According to the instructions of the minister, the NOC revoked the registration of both the Nepal Taekwondo Association and the National Taekwondo Association on December 20, 2022. Then, it registered the Nepal Taekwondo Federation with Pradeep Joshi as the coordinator and Indraman Tuladhar as the general secretary.
Joshi is the former vice president of the Nepal Taekwondo Association and Tuladhar is the former general secretary of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA).
After cancelling their association and forming another one, the Rana-led association went to court and the Patan High Court gave an interim order. On January 4, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the NSC and others were called for discussion.
As this dispute in taekwondo in Nepal seems never-ending, the ones to feel the brunt are the players. This has resulted in many leaving Nepal and going abroad.
Taekwondo, karate and other sports started in Nepal in 1982 when martial arts was recognised as a sport in the country. Taekwondo, registered at NSC in 1989, then became a sport that brought Nepal the most success on the international stage.
In the 13th SAG held in Nepal in 2019, taekwondo won the most medals (12 gold, 6 silver and 11 bronze medals). Taekwondo was the only sport in the 13th SAG in which all 34 athletes representing Nepal won medals.
But the key players winning medals for taekwondo in Nepal are in abroad now. The list includes Bhupen Shrestha, Parwati Gurung, Sanjila Timalsina, Sangeeta Basyal and Saksham Karki who won the gold; Neema Gurung and Apsara Karki who won the silver; and Manoj Malla, Gyanendra Hamal and Nischal Man Shrestha who won the bronze medals.
Similarly, Krishna Bahadur Tamang and Kiran Bahadur Ale who went to South Korea to take part in competitions representing taekwondo in Nepal have not been in contact with Nepal Taekwondo Association since then. Both won silver medals at the 2019 SAG.
Manita Shahi, who won a silver in the 13th SAG, left for the US a while back. Double gold winner Ayesha Shakya and gold winner Seena Maden, who are still in Nepal, have decided not to be involved in taekwondo. They chose not to take part in the 9th National Games held in Pokhara.
“This happens when the associations don’t care about the players. They did what they thought was right because competitions stopped happening regularly when they were at the peak of their careers,” says Deepak Bista, the most successful player of taekwondo in Nepal.
Players quitting taekwondo and leaving Nepal have put an end to all hopes that Nepal might do well in international tournaments in the coming days.
“Not everyone in taekwondo in Nepal has thought for the game and the players,” says the head coach Naveen Kumar Shrestha. “Champions are not produced overnight. There is a long process for that. We could not protect the players who had potential. Now, we are paying the price for the lack of long-term planning.”
Even if you look at the international performances, as the head coach Shrestha said, taekwondo in Nepal is on a downward spiral. Since Deepak Bista, Ayesha Shakya and Manita Shahi won bronze medals in the 2006 Doha Asian Games, taekwondo has not won a medal in major international competitions.
Nepal’s Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in taekwondo, which was included as an exhibition sport in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Lama and Sita Rai have also won medals in the World Championships. Sangina Vaidya won a gold medal in the Asian Championship. Vaidya and Bista even took part in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.
Before that, Lama, Ram Bahadur Gharti Chhetri, Raj Kumar Rai and Rajkumar Budhathoki won the bronze in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games. In the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Man Bahadur Shahi won the bronze.
While Sabita Rajbhandari won a historic silver media in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Bista, Renuka Thapa Magar and Ritu Jini Rai won the bronze in the 2002 Asian Games in Busan. The silver won by Rajbhandari is the highest success in Nepal Taekwondo so far.
In the Asian Taekwondo Championship held in South Korea last year, Nepal’s Yunisha Rai (Olympic scholarship holder), Bir Bahadur Mahara, Niraj Deuba and Kiran Bahadur Ale participated. They went to Korea at their own expense as they did not get any sponsors or help from the associations promoting taekwondo in Nepal. They even tried to take part in the World Championship by paying money from their own pocket, but due to visa issues, they could not take part.
Deepak Bista called Bhupen Shrestha Nepal’s golden boy and saw him as the future of taekwondo in Nepal. But, now in Melbourne, Shrestha feels he did not get anything from the sport even though he gave his entire youth to it.
“Training is poor. We hardly get to take part in international tournaments. I can’t sustain myself doing taekwondo in Nepal. The association also does not care about it. Why do I keep playing this,” he questions.
The coaches of the national team are in unison about the need to keep players like him in the country if they aim to win an international medal in taekwondo.
But, despite being undisputed in his weight category, he was not considered worthy of a scholarship for the 2024 Olympic Solidarity Course.
“I was hoping that I would be able to go to the Asian Championship last June. But after talking to my seniors, I understood that I had to bear all the cost. That made me want to quit taekwondo in Nepal because no one cares about us players despite calling us jewels,” he says.
Why did the golden boy quit a sport in which he was destined to succeed? Olympian Bista says the government needs to find an answer to this question to ensure this does not happen again.
“A lot of effort goes into producing players like Bhupen. But all our efforts go in vain when the associations and the government stop caring,” says Bista. “This trend will continue. More people will go abroad and that will be the end of taekwondo in Nepal as we know it.”

Nepal T20 League: ICC team inspects spot-fixing allegations and returns,"Friday, January 6, 2023","Kathmandu, January 6
Officials from the International Cricket Council (ICC) were in Kathmandu to investigate the spot-fixing allegations in the ongoing Nepal T20 League.
The team came to Kathmandu on Thursday after being notified by Nepal T20 League’s anti-corruption unit (ACU) chief Vir Singh. Singh has been getting complaints about spot-fixing on a regular basis.
The ICC team left Kathmandu on Friday after taking stock of the issues reported to them by Singh.
After the suspicion of spot-fixing in the tournament, the ICC has increased its surveillance. According to sources, it is said that the ICC has started an investigation with priority based on the reporting done by Singh and his team.
The ICC officials inspected the TU Cricket Ground and met Singhon Thursday. The team also met officials from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police and the member secretary of the National Sports Council (NSC) Tanka Lal Ghising.
On Wednesday, the NSC formed an inquiry committee under the leadership of executive committee member Ekendra Kunwar to investigate foreign players playing in the Nepal T20 League without a work permit, betting and possible spot-fixing.
Member Secretary Ghisingh admits that he had a meeting with the ICC representatives but does not want to reveal more.
“Both ICC and NSC are the regulatory bodies of Nepal cricket. Necessary discussions were held between us,” he says. “They have asked us to keep the contents of the discussion confidential.”
Cricket Association of Nepal says it is notified about the ICC sending its ACU officers only on Wednesday evening.
“They have come and taken stock of everything,” says CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand who added the spot-fixing had not taken plan in Nepal T20 League.
However, team captains have publicly said their players had been approached by various people to fix matches. A member of CAN has told Onlinekhabar that the list of complaints at the league’s ACU in regard to spot-fixing is long.
Biratnagar Superkings captain Andre McCarthy has not been allowed to play based on the complaint filed in ACU.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-t20-league-icc-team-inspect.html,sports
Nepal T20 League: CAN planning to terminate contract with Seven3Sports,"Thursday, January 5, 2023","Kathmandu, January 5
The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) is planning to terminate its contract with Seven3Sports.
This comes after Jatin Ahluwalia, the co-founder of Seven3Sports, the commercial and strategic partner of the Nepal T20 League, fled to India.
CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand says Ahluwalia fled to India as he did not want to pay the money his company owed to CAN.
“He told us he’s going to India to manage the bank transfer, but it looks like he’s not coming back. This automatically terminates the contract we had between us and them,” says Chand.
Ahluwalia, citing security reasons, has refused to return to Nepal.
CAN, in May 2022, signed an eight-year agreement with Seven3Sports. According to the agreement, Seven3Sports  would pay can around Rs 330 million for having exclusive rights to the Nepal T20 League.
As per the agreement, CAN should have received around Rs 39 million for the first edition, but it says Seven3Sports only gave it Rs 12 million so far in two instalments.
Speaking to Onlinekhabar, Chand says that CAN is ready to terminate the contract with Seven3Sports if Ahluwalia does not contact them soon. He also says it would seek legal remedies to solve this issue.
“We will finish the tournament and then deal with his issue,” says Chand.
According to Chand, Ahluwalia was planning to pay CAN through Nepali sponsors and ticket money. But as both did not happen, he fled to India.
Ahluwalia before leaving Nepal had even proposed that CAN take the tournament to Dubai. After news of fixing surfaced in Nepali media, he told CAN things would be easier for them in Dubai.
“We refused that offer and told him we’d seek permission from the government to do the next edition in Dubai,” says Chand.
This, however, will not affect players as the franchise teams will pay them, says Chand.
“The teams are in contact and they will pay the players,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/can-terminate-contract-seven3sports.html,sports
"Nepal T20 League: CAN says fixing news is fake, asks people to come with proof","Wednesday, January 4, 2023","Kathmandu, January 4
The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has responded to match-fixing and spot-fixing allegations that are casting a dark shadow in the ongoing Nepal T20 League.
Issuing a statement on Wednesday, CAN dismissed claims that match-fixing and spot-fixing were happening in Nepal T20 League.
In the statement, CAN also asked people to come up with proof of match-fixing and spot-fixing and report it to either CAN or the tournament’s anti-corruption unit (ACU).
Acting secretary, Prashant Bikram Malla asked people not to spread fake news and hurt the integrity of the league and Nepal as a country.
Following the allegations, the Home Ministry has asked Nepal Police to form a team and investigate if fixing is going on in the tournament.
Players from different teams, however, say they have been approached by people to fix matches. They have also accused teams of not paying them salaries.

Nepal T20 League controversy: What happened today?,"Tuesday, January 3, 2023","Kathmandu, January 3
Nepal T20 League is once again in the news for the wrong reasons.
Players representing Kathmandu Knights and Biratnagar Superkings refused the take the field on Tuesday morning. They said they did not want to take the field stating they had not been paid their due salaries.
The players did take the field later on as the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) guaranteed that the players would be paid.
They resorted to protest after the news of Jatin Ahluwalia, the co-founder of Seven3Sports, the commercial and strategic partner of Nepal T20 League, fleeing to India to avoid paying the players started making rounds.
Ahluwalia however, dismissed the claim as he told Onlinekhabar from India that he had gone there to manage bank transfers to ensure the cricketers would be paid.
This is not the only news that has come out from Nepal T20 League.
Sachin Timalsena, one of the commentators of the tournament, has said he is no longer going to be a part of the tournament as he has seen hints of spot-fixing during the tournament.
Releasing a video on Facebook, he said he had seen hints of spot-fixing during different matches and had reported them to the anti-corruption unit and CAN.
Gyanendra Malla, the captain of Kathmandu Knights, supported Timilsena’s claim as told journalists on Tuesday that one of his players was approached by someone who wanted to spot-fix.
“When he came to us, we directly went to the ACU and reported the incident,” said Malla.
This news is bad news for CAN which had hoped the tournament would be a springboard for Nepali cricket.
Onlinekhabar had previously reported that betting on the Nepal T20 League had been seen rampant outside Nepal.

Priya Rai: Nepal’s emerging trail and ultra runner can’t wait to show what she’s made up of,"Sunday, January 1, 2023","Standing at the start line of the Doi Inthanon Thailand by UTMB in Chang Mai in Thailand on December 10, 2022, Priya Rai was nervous. It was the 22-year-old’s first race away from Nepal and there were over a thousand men and women waiting to start the race with her.
Thanks to her record in Nepal, she was in the front row, which was full of elite runners. There were people far more experienced than her, but she was not letting that get to her. She had trained for nearly three months and was desperate to show the best version of herself and prove to everyone out in Thailand and Nepal what a great runner she was.
“Looking back I put myself under a lot of pressure. I wanted to win the race so bad,” says Rai.
Rai did not win, but her efforts got her second place in the 54-kilometre race. It was a long hard grind, but all her training paid off as she defeated some good runners to come in second. Now, Priya Rai wants to continue to push hard and make her name for herself in the field of trail and ultra running as she hopes to win bigger races in the future and make herself and the people who supported her proud.
Priya Rai only started running around four years ago. After reading about runners like Courtney Dauwalter, she wanted to try it out. But, as trail running was not big despite the likes of Mira Rai achieving a lot, Priya decided to start her training by running on the hills of Shivapuri.
“I started by running two kilometres uphill every morning around the hills of Shivapuri. It was tough at the start as I injured my calf in school when I practised taekwondo,” Rai says, “But gradually, it started to become easy as I started to follow Nepal Army personnel during their morning run.”
Things changed for her when she ran her first race in college. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing when she decided to take part in the race on the day itself. She did not have proper clothes nor did she have shoes. A teacher lent her his jersey and shorts and Priya Rai stood in the starting line wearing oversized clothes.
“I didn’t even have shoes so I ran barefoot.”
Running barefoot, she came in second overall and first in the female category. This was the beginning for her as she started to feel she was born to run. That win gave her the confidence to go to Bhojpur where Mira Rai was hosting the Bhojpur Trail Race.
“I only found out it was a trail race when I got on the bus.”
Priya Rai ran it and did not do as well as she had expected. She even fell ill during the race as it was strenuous on her body.
“I learnt a lot about trail racing in 2018. I played a lot that year and didn’t do well but was a great learning phase that year.”
The more races she ran, the more she understood what she needed to do and that shaped her into who she is today.
But, for that, Priya Rai also needed gear. Trail running gear is expensive and is rarely available in Nepal. She took part in different races in Kathmandu valley and slowly started getting recognised. That got her support from the likes of Richard Bull who even gave her proper shoes to run with.
She also stopped eating spicy food, her favourite, as she started to step up her effort to get better at trail running. Her sacrifice then started to bear fruit as in 2019, she announced herself in Nepal’s running scene with podiums and wins in trail races across the country.
Priya Rai won the Sindhupalchok Trail Race and Manaslu Mountain Trail Race and came second in the Mustang Trail Race and Gosaikunda to Helambu Trail Marathon. She also came in the top five of the Annapurna 100 and Stupa to Stupa Ultra.
“That made me feel I could compete with anyone.”
But, then Covid happened and everything went to a standstill. That frustrated her a lot, but she continued to train.
“The uncertainty didn’t help but I carried on training.”
Her family was quite supportive of her too and has always pushed her to continue her passion. They have always provided her with whatever they could, but there have been times apart from the coronavirus pandemic that has frustrated her.
“Money is something that has been an issue. Coming from Nepal, we rarely get sponsors and getting shoes, bags and other gear have been a challenge as they cost a fortune.”
Priya Rai says she has even sewn running shoes after they tore and were worn out. There were times she was embarrassed by it, but as races usually started in the dark, she felt no one would notice.
Another challenge for her was getting support from fellow Nepali runners. Apart from a few like Preeti Khatri, who arranged a coach for her before going to Thailand, she says no one really helped her out by giving tips and tricks.
“This year, when I ran in Thailand, I realised how helpful foreign runners are. The person who came first taught me so much. In Nepal, the competition is somewhat unhealthy,” Rai says.
Rai also does not understand why the government does not support runners like her. She believes people like her have so much potential to win big, but as the government does not recognise the sport, whatever has been done so far has been by adventure enthusiasts alone.
But, that has not stopped Priya Rai as she qualified for the Doi Inthanon on her merit and came second. When she crossed the finish line, she was still unsure if she really had finished second. Before going to Thailand, she had rehearsed how she would celebrate, but when she crossed the finish line, she forgot all about it.
“I didn’t have any emotion in me. I think I was relieved more than anything. Looking back, I was so shy and had to ask people in Nepal if I had really come in second.”
That second place got Priya Rai a lot of attention. Many companies approached her and asked if she had been signed up. One even offered her a contract and provided her with a coach and a team who she is in contact with regularly.
“It’s opened up new avenues and now I want to push myself to see how far I can go.”
This podium finish means she has qualified for the UTMB OCC (Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc Orsières-Champex-Chamonix), a 55km race that is one of seven races featured in the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc event that takes place annually at Chamonix in France. There, she will go head-to-head against the best in the world.
Priya Rai knows it is going to be tough but knows that she has the ability and is eager to show the world what a little girl from Khotang of eastern Nepal can do.
“I can’t wait to show what I am made up of,” she says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/priya-rai-nepal-runner.html,sports
2022 review: 9 things to remember from the Nepali sports sector,"Saturday, December 31, 2022","This year, the Nepali sports sector witnessed a plethora of events. Some of them made the nation proud and raised hope while some of them broke the hearts of thousands of Nepali sports fans. Meanwhile, it also saw the downfall of a star player.
Among the various events that happened in the Nepali sports sector in 2022, Onlinekhabar has chosen nine events that you should know about.
In November, Nepal won the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) U-15 Women’s Championship. Nepal earned 10 points from four matches in the competition played in a double round-robin format. Nepal remained the tournament’s sole unbeaten team, sparking a new hope in the Nepali sports sector. Bangladesh, the runners-up, were limited to seven points.
In November, Nepal won the Ssixer ODI Series beating the UAE by 6 wickets at Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground. This was the first bilateral ODI series win for Nepal at home.
The Nepali women’s football team became the first runners-up at SAFF Women’s Championship after losing to Bangladesh 3-1 at Dasharath Stadium in September. Nepal entered the final after winning over India in the semis. India were defeated for the first time in the 12-year-long history of the SAFF Women’s Championship.
The Nepali women’s basketball team ended up being the first runners-up in the South Asian Basketball Championship (SABA) Women’s Championship held in the Maldives in September.
Nepal had played in an international basketball tournament after three years.
After three years, the National Games was organised in October in Pokhara. The ninth edition of the biggest event in the Nepali sports sector featured 36 sporting disciplines. Nepal Army with a total of 371 medals stood in the first rank. Similarly, APF and Nepal Police Club stood in second and third position with 219 and 195 medals, respectively.
The Nepal T20 League, the franchise tournament of the Cricket Association of Nepal, kicked off on December 24. The tournament featured altogether six teams: Kathmandu Knights, Lumbini All Stars, Biratnagar Super Kings, Janakpur Royals, Pokhara Avengers and Farwest United. However, the event has been shrouded in controversy due to different factors. It seems the Nepali sports sector is not much hopeful of its impact.
The Nepali sports sector was shaken to the core after famed cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane was arrested on the charge of raping a minor. In November, the Kathmandu District Court sent Nepal’s former cricket captain Lamichhane to judicial custody until the final verdict on the rape charge he is facing.
Dozens of Nepali national footballers left the country this year after feeling financially insecure in the Nepali sports sector. The failure of the football-governing body led them to choose foreign land, as reported.
Some of the aspiring footballers who left Nepal this year include Ashish Lama, Suman Lama, Abhishek Rijal, Rajan Gurung and Shiva Gurung. All these players are currently playing amateur football in Australia.
This year, the Nepali national cricket team performed under the supervision of two different coaches: Pubudu Dassanayake and Manoj Prabhakar. The Nepali cricket team have a history of playing for a short span of time under the guidance of foreign coaches, and the trouble continued this year also.
Dassanayake was appointed in December 2021 and he resigned in July. Similarly, Prabhakar was appointed in August as the head coach of the national team and he stepped down from the post in December, making the entire Nepali sports sector hopeless.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/2022-review-nepali-sports-sector.html,sports

Match-fixing suspicions as Nepal T20 League is on betting sites,"Monday, December 26, 2022","Kathmandu, November 26
Betting on Nepal T20 League has been seen rampant outside Nepal.
Betting applications like Bet 365 and 1xBet have included Nepal T20 League on their app, through which millions are involved in betting.
Some photos emerged from India show a betting code appearing during broadcasting on the FanCode app. This has raised suspicions that the matches are being fixed.
Betting is illegal in Nepal. But, Seven3Sports, which has entered into a commercial and strategic partnership agreement with the Nepal Cricket Association (CAN) to run the Nepal T20 League, has been registered with the purpose of operating betting houses in India.
Even in Nepal, this company has been registered by the Company Registrar’s Office despite the rejection of the Nepal Sports Council.
Indian companies and businesspersons have heavily influenced the league as an Indian company is operating the league and four out of the six teams are owned by Indians.
1XBat, which was announced as the main sponsor of the tournament, is also connected to betting.
As betting is taking place prominently, many say that the chances of the matches being fixed are quite high.
However, Seven3Sports, which has received the CAN and operating rights, has been saying that the tournament will be held under the direct supervision of ICC’s Integrity Officer and Sports Radar.
No CAN official was ready to make any comment about the issue.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-t20-league-betting.html,sports

Cricket coach Manoj Prabhakar to resign,"Monday, December 12, 2022","Kathmandu, December 12
The coach of the Nepal national cricket team, Manoj Prabhakar, is planning to resign. He signed a one-year contract on August 8.
Prabhakar left for India on Monday after officials of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) pressured him to leave the post. He will likely send in his resignation from India.
An official working for CAN said it was unlikely that Prabhakar would continue as coach of the national cricket team as results over the past few months have been really poor.
During his tenure, Nepal beat Kenya 3-2 in a T20I series and 3-0 in an ODI series. He also led Nepal to a 2-1 win in the Ssixer ODI Series against UAE in Nepal.

Nepal cricket: ODI status is at stake as the new captain and coach couldn’t solve old problems,"Monday, December 12, 2022","There was a time when the only way to follow Nepal cricket was ESPN’s Cricinfo ball-by-ball update. The time was such when a Nepali cricket fan would jump with joy when they saw a boundary being scored while they would often pull their hairs out when a wicket fell. Live cricket was an anomaly back then, yet the interest was crazy.
Times are different now. Nepal cricket games are live either on TV or on YouTube, but the interest is not the same. With the onset of T20 crickets, fans do not care for or do not have the time to sit through a 50-over game. Further, what has not helped is Nepal’s poor performances in the 50-over format, which seems to have frustrated the Nepal cricket fans.
The recent Namibia tour, which was a part of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, is evidence of this.
The ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 was Nepal’s best chance to be a part of the 2023 ICC World Cup that would be held in India. Performances in League 2 also determine if associate nations retain or lose their ODI status.
Nepal ticket team played their sixth series of League 2 in Namibia and it was Nepal’s worst performance so far, which means Nepal’s road to the World Cup is most likely over and it is also likely that Nepal will also lose their ODI status.
The team went into the series with a new coach and captain. But, the tour turned out to be a nightmare for both Manoj Prabhakar and Rohit Paudel.
This was Paudel’s first overseas tour as the captain and Nepal were not able to win a single game as they lost three matches while one was a washout. His personal performance was also below par. It was not just him. Everyone’s performance in the series was poor. To put it bluntly, everyone, from the coach to the players, flopped on this tour.
This was the first time that Nepal failed to win a single in a League 2 series, which has raised alarm bells.
Out of the seven teams in League 2, Nepal cricket team are currently in the sixth position with 18 points from 24 games. Now, with the World Cup qualification out of the window, Nepal’s focus is on ensuring they retain their ODI status. But, even that is hard.
Nepal have not beaten Namibia in League 2 and even though they won one game against Scotland in Scotland, they lost the next three games. If you look at past results, Nepal are winless in the last six games.
Before going to Namibia, Nepal played a three-match series against the UAE at home and won 2-1. They even went to India to play a few practice games before going to Namibia. The spirits were high as even Prabhakar said preparations were good.
But, he had said Nepali players needed to learn from mistakes and not repeat them. Paudel also emphasised the need to play better cricket with both the bat and the ball.
That was easier said than done as Nepal continued to make the same mistakes as batting once again became the team’s Achilles’ heel as Nepal’s batters kept throwing their wickets right from the start as runs dried up.
Bowlers, who have been Nepal’s strength, also did not perform. With Sandeep Lamichhane facing a criminal case, Nepal’s middle-over bowling suffered as spinners failed to pick up wickets. No Nepali bowler was able to break partnerships to turn the game in the team’s favour.
Even though the coach had said preparations were good before the series, the reality looked different. This has resulted in many calling for Prabhakar’s head, which, after such a performance, should not be surprising.
Former captain Gyanendra Malla’s 75 runs in the first match against Namibia was the only half-century made by a Nepali player. Captain Paudel failed in the first match but followed it up with 44 and 47, but with the team needing a bigger score, he failed to make an impact as the captain.
What did not help the batters was the constant chipping and changing of players. With the batting order continuously changing, players seemed to be confused about their roles. Only Arjun Saud played all four matches in the same position.
Nepal’s ODI status is in jeopardy after the Namibia tour. This shows how Nepal cricket is taking a step back after a few good years. With Nepal needing to win nine of the remaining 12 matches, it is almost certain that they will lose their ODI status.
Nepal’s only chance to preserve the ODI status is through the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off. Six teams will take part in the tournament, the bottom four teams from League 2 along with the top teams in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League. The top two teams from this tournament will progress to the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.
Past results suggest even this qualifier series is not going to be easy. But, if the Nepal cricket team want to retain the ODI status, they have to play out of their skin.

"World Cup dream all but over for Nepal cricket team, battle to retain ODI status","Thursday, December 8, 2022","Kathmandu, December 8
After losing to Namibia by 86 runs in the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, Nepal cricket team’s doors to qualify for the global qualifiers of the ICC Cricket World Cup in India in 2023 is all but over.
Out of the three games played by Nepal in Namibia, they have not won a single match. The first game against Namibia was a washout as the two teams shared a point each. Nepal lost the next two games to Scotland by three wickets and Namibia by 86 runs.
With this, Nepal have accumulated a total of 18 points from 23 games and are currently in the sixth position in ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 standing. This means Nepal’s chances of finishing in the top 3 of the standing are all but over.
The top three directly qualified for the global qualifiers of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup.
Scotland currently lead the table with 44 points. Oman, also on 44 points, are second due to net run rate followed by Namibia on 37 points.
Nepal now have 13 games remaining and can reach 44 points if they win all their games, which, given recent performance, is unlikely.
Now Nepal’s focus is on retaining the ODI status and reaching the global qualifiers via the playoffs. To retain the ODI status, Nepal have to finish fifth in the standing which is currently occupied by the UAE who have 27 points.
After returning from Namibia, Nepal will play three more series part of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 out of which two are at home.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-cricket-odi-world-cup.html,sports
Mausam Dhakal: 21-year-old cricket star is here to fill Nepal’s spin bowling gap,"Tuesday, December 6, 2022","Before the Prime Minister’s Cup national one-day cricket tournament, Mausam Dhakal was not a name people heard. The 21-year-old leg spinner, who is under contract for the departmental team Armed Police Force (APF) Club, has managed to attract the attention of many after being declared the emerging player of the tournament.
In the match, Dhakal who hails from Bhalwari of Rupandehi, took wickets in five out of six matches played by the champion team. His feat includes the crucial three wickets of the Tribhuvan Army Club in the final.
Apart from that, Dhakal also took two wickets from Sudurpaschim, four each from Gandaki and Karnali, and two wickets from Madhesh. Dhakal, who bowled 38 overs in six innings, took 15 wickets, spending 185 runs while keeping two maidens.
With his potential, Mausam Dhakal is considered a strong contender for the national team. The emergence of Dhakal has come at a time when the Nepali cricket team are looking for a reliable leg spinner.
The bowling performance of the national cricket team has declined after Sandeep Lamichhane, who has been behind bars following a rape accusation. Nepal’s strength in international cricket is spin bowling, and Lamichhane had been the one on the reins for the last five years. However, in his absence now, Nepal can use Dhakal, another leg spinner, as their weapon.
It has been seven years since Mausam Dhakal started looking for a future in cricket. His career started at 14, playing in the Star Cricket Academy in Rupandehi.
Shakti Gauchan, a former star spinner of the Nepali national cricket team, taught him how to hold the bat and hit the ball. Similarly, Indian cricketer Pradeep Sahu, who came to Nepal and played franchise cricket, improved his ability.
Even though he got unexpected success in his first attempt at domestic cricket, he is not in a hurry to take a giant leap in his career. And, he has not thought about anything other than cricket. But, now that he is emerging, the joy and pressure are equal for him.  And, he understands that he can experience his share of success, with time.
“I do not wish to rush and do everything right now. If the process is all smooth and if I can continue to prove myself, I know I will reach the top, eventually,” says Mausam Dhakal. “I will continue to work hard. I had not thought that I would reach this far.”
There is a lot of competition among the players who play from the bowling position in the national team. And, Dhakal, knowing all the challenges of maintaining his position and rhythm, has not rushed to join the national team.
In domestic and franchise cricket in Nepal, Sharad Vesawkar is known as a captain who believes in young players. He is credited for identifying current established players like Asif Sheikh, Rohit Paudel, and Kushal Malla. Vesawkar took Dhakal in his team Bhairawa Gladiators during last year’s Everest Premier League. Unfortunately, he did not get to play.
Mausam Dhakal had already signed a contract with the APF for the ninth National Games men’s cricket last August. However, he did not get the opportunity to debut in the national competition.
After Abhinash Bohora of the APF went to Australia, Dhakal was given the opportunity to play for the team; and the decision proved right. “Mausam is a good player with great abilities. He can do even better in the future,” Vesawkar shares about Dhakal.
Though he made his debut in one-day domestic cricket, the cricket fraternity is confident that Dhakal can perform better in the T20 series too. Dhakal has a record of playing T20 more than one-day series while training in India.
“It is wrong to think that I will be a part of the team without any performance. If you work hard and perform, you will be in the team. Otherwise, someone better than you will come along,” says Mausam Dhakal. “Getting a chance in any team is not a small achievement. The national team is a place to represent the country, but I need more time and hard work to reach there.”
Bu,t a player’s career is not going to be constant. Dhakal’s career has just started among his peers, and Dhakal’s role model Vesawkar keeps reminding him not to be distracted by the ups and downs of his career. Heeding his advice, Dhakal even says that he has started to meditate and do yoga during his difficult and unstable times.
The one who created the fascination regarding cricket in Dhakal’s mind was his father, Ghanashyam. His father was also very fond of cricket. It was his father who took the teenage boy to Shakti Gauchan’s Star Cricket Academy. He trained in the academy for five years under Gauchan.
After completing his school, Mausam Dhakal went to New Delhi, to learn cricket from Pradeep Sahu. “Now I stay in India a lot; I only come to take exams.”
His training there and the standard of cricket in India have greatly influenced him. “The only thing a player needs is the experience of playing games. And while training in India, we get to play many games.”
During the lockdown, while bowling at the Tirupati Cricket Academy in Rupandehi, Dhakal caught cricketer Basant Regmi’s attention, and it became easier for Dhakal to play in the format of domestic cricket as Regmi connected Dhakal to APF.
And there, he met his idol Sharad Vesawkar. “The first time we talked, he asked me to send a video of my gameplay.”
Talking about his inspirations over the years, Mausam Dhakal says, “My coach also tells me that I can do much better. Shakti dai and Basant dai also encourage me a lot. I am eternally grateful to them.”

Nepal cricket’s Namibia tour: Do the new team live up to the World Cup qualification hope?,"Friday, December 2, 2022","A new-look Nepal cricket team led by Rohit Paudel will play their first match of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 today as they take on hosts Namibia in Windhoek.
Here, Nepal will take on Namibia and Scotland until December 8 as they hope to make inroads in the league table to stand a chance at qualifying for the ICC Cricket World Cup in India in 2023.
Currently second from the bottom with 17 points, Nepal face a tough battle to reach the global qualifiers of the World Cup where the top three teams will take part. So if Nepal want to make inroads, they will have to will all four games in Namibia.
But, past records do not paint a good picture as the Nepal cricket team only managed to win one out of the four games played against the same two opponents in Scotland in July.
A lot has changed since the series. Both the captain and coach have changed as have some members of the team. The environment of the Nepal cricket team is also different as many are keeping a keen eye on how the team fare against Scotland and Namibia.
Following the rape charge against former captain Sandeep Lamichhane, the Nepal cricket team are going into the four matches with Paudel as the captain. Lamichhane led the team in three of the five series in the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2.
Nepal are likely to miss Lamichhane the bowler more than Lamichhane the captain as he took 42 wickets in 20 League 2 games. Even though Karan KC has a good record of picking up 37 wickets in 19 games, there is doubt among many regarding who will take wickets during the middle overs of games.
In the recently held Ssixers ODI Series against the UAE, Nepal’s middle-over bowling looked weak. Despite Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal doing well along with Kushal Bhurtel, the Nepal cricketers were unable to pick up regular wickets during the middle overs. Despite Nepal winning the series 2-1 and the bowlers doing a decent job, it will be interesting to see how they will perform away from home and how Paudel will captain his troops.
Nepal’s coach Manoj Prabhakar said the series against UAE was like a practice series before the League 2 series in Namibia.
In the first match, Nepal’s batting failed as the UAE beat Nepal by 84 runs. Following that loss, the batters did show grit and they won the second and third matches by three and six wickets respectively as the Nepal cricketers won their first bilateral series at home.
Before leaving Nepal, coach Prabhakar said the team did well in the series against the UAE and added it was good preparation for the Namibia tour. That said, he said as the team were still young they were still susceptible to mistakes and that he was working with the players to reduce these mistakes.
Along with reducing mistakes, captain Paudel said the team needed to bat well and they had learnt a lot from the UAE series.
Openers Arjun Saud and Aasif Sheikh along with Gyanendra Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee all scored half-centuries in the series, which is a good sign.
The Nepal cricket team then even went to Delhi to play a few practice matches as they could not practice at the TU Cricket Ground due to a u-19 cricket tournament taking place there. Nepal lost the first practice game in Delhi despite captain Paudel and Airee scoring centuries. Nepal won the second game thanks to a superb bowling display from Sagar Dhakal. How much will this help in Namibia? Only time will tell it.
Namibia are the informed team as they won three out of the four matches they played against the USA and Papua New Guinea. Scotland are not a slouch either as they recently returned after playing the T20 World Cup in Australia.
The Nepal cricket team have seen a host of changes since the Scotland series. Following a disappointing series, Pubudu Dassanayake resigned and was replaced by former Indian allrounder Manoj Prabhakar.
Prabhakar’s approach to the game was different from Dassanayake’s. Former captain Gyanendra Malla was recalled to the squad, but destructive opener Kushal Bhurtel was dropped and replaced by Arjun Saud. Both Malla and Saud played well in Kenya and impressed Prabhakar who has once again included them in his team to take on Namibia and Scotland.
Basir Ahmed, Adil Alam, Binod Bhandari, Dev Khanal, Kishor Mahato and Pawan Saraff, who were part of the Scotland tour, miss out on the Namibia tour.
Replacing them are Gulshan Jha, Nandan Yadav, Sagar Dhakal, Hari Shankar Sah and Lalit Rajbanshi. Prabhakar expects Jha, Airee, Bhurtel and Sah to perform with both bat and ball.
The current Nepal cricket team have four specialist batters: Paudel, Aasif Sheikh, Malla and Saud. Saud and Aasif are wicketkeepers too. Airee will also have to play well for Nepal to stand a chance at winning games in Namibia along with Bhurtel who will likely be used as a finisher in this series too.
This is going to be tough series for Nepal. Even though Nepal are familiar with conditions in Namibia thanks to the different series they have played there, the team will want to do better than what they did in Scotland.
Former captain Gyanendra Malla says the preparation of the teams has been good and they hope to do a lot better than the Scotland series when they lost three matches.
“Our aim is to win three out of the four matches. That’s the challenge we’ve given ourselves and we hope we can achieve it,” says Malla.

Nepal T20 League: Katmandu Gurkhas pull out of tournament,"Wednesday, November 30, 2022","Kathmandu, November 30
Kathmandu Gorkhas, a franchise team planning to participate in the Nepal T20 League, have pulled out of the tournament.
The team owned by Kantipur Media Group pulling out of the tournament less than two weeks from the first game has cast a shadow over the tournament.
Nepal T20 League is the first T20 league being organised by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN). The tournament was due to start on December 11 and end on December 31.
Acting secretary of CAN, Prashant Bikram Malla, says efforts are underway to find a new team and transfer the players to the other team.
“Since we’ve taken ICC’s permission to do the league, we have to do it at any cost. We think the league will be delayed by a week,” said Malla.
Earlier, the league scheduled to be held in September had been postponed after the Home Ministry told CAN that it could not provide security on the eve of the elections.
All procedures have been completed including the player auction. The marquee player of Kathmandu Gorkhas was former Nepali captain Gyanendra Malla.

"FIFA World Cup 2022, for Nepali migrant workers’ families, is a reminder of deaths and sufferings","Tuesday, November 29, 2022","Bhim Bahadur Lohar, from Madhuwan rural municipality in Bardiya, went to Qatar to work in 2010. There he worked for a construction company tasked to build buildings including one of the eight stadiums that are currently hosting the FIFA World Cup 2022.
Lohar called his wife every day; they talked about his day there and what his family were doing in Nepal. He sent most of what he earnt, Rs 35,000 a month, back home as his family built a house with the money he sent.
He was healthy and was not suffering from any chronic disease but one day his wife, Sita, received a call from relatives telling her Lohar died in Qatar.
“His death certificate said he died a natural death. But, it didn’t state how he died,” says Sita. “He hadn’t been paid for around five months and his company sent Rs 295,000 after his death.”
If the money was his due salary or the provident fund, she does not know.
Lohar died on January 13 and he arrived in a box 10 days later. After the arrival of his lifeless body, the insurance company gave Sita Rs 1.4 million and Rs 700,000 from the government’s labour department.
“Who will look after us now? How long will the money last,” says Sita, who worries for her 12-year-old daughter, as the FIFA World Cup begins in Qatar in fervour.
As Nepal and the world is engulfed in the World Cup fever, many seem to have forgotten its dark side. Lohar is one of the thousands of Nepalis who died in Qatar due to harsh working conditions. Even though Qatar continues to deny this, multiple reports in various international media outlets show how extreme working conditions were for those involved in the construction of stadiums and other buildings.
Despite many Nepalis returning home in coffins and others with chronic illnesses, their families here still waiting for compensation and insurance money. Many refuse to watch the FIFA World Cup hosted by a country which changed their lives forever, for the worse.
Janakpur’s Budhan Pandit is one of the many victimised by Qatar’s FIFA World Cup plan. Pandit and his family lived in a small hut made out of zinc sheets and tarpaulin. During the summer, it got unbearably hot; in the monsoon, water sept in from everywhere; in the winter, the cold was spine-tingling. To ensure his two teenage sons did not have to suffer the same fate, Pandit went to work in Doha in 2017. But, little did he know that he would never see them again.
Pandit, 42, died while building the runway for an airport in Doha on June 21, 2021.
Pandit’s family was shaken. The only source of income for them was Pandit, but after his death, his elder son Umesh, 19, has been tasked with the responsibility as he tries to earn money working as a labourer.
Pandit’s family hoped they would get compensation and insurance money. But, all they received was Rs 25,000 to perform the final rites. They did all the paperwork, but they are yet to receive compensation from the Department of Labour or the company he worked for.
“I’ve been going to different government bodies, but they don’t respond to my questions. It seems the government just doesn’t care. I’ve given them all the necessary documents, but things have not moved forward,” says 17-year-old Dinesh, Pandit’s younger son.
Pandit’s wife Urmila is worried about what they will do if they do not get the compensation amount. A case has been filed against them for building a house on the land that is owned by her father-in-law. Her elder son dropped out of school as the family could not afford it while their younger son is on the verge of dropping out.
“I worry for the future of my sons,” she says.
Baldev Sah, 64, is emotional when he talks about his son. With tears in his eyes, he accuses the leaders of the country of not caring about people like them. He accuses them of buying votes but not creating opportunities for young people who have no choice but to go work abroad and come home in the box.
“They are selfish. They don’t care about the poor. All they care about is money and power. I can’t believe my son is gone,” he says, remembering his son Dasain who died while preparing infrastructure for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
Qatar won the race to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, beating out powerful countries. But, the country did not have the infrastructure to host the world’s biggest football tournament. To build them, Qatar started recruiting a large number of workers from countries like Nepal, India, and Pakistan among others.
As the demand for workers increased, lots of Nepalis started queueing up outside recruitment agencies. The number of Nepalis going to Qatar in 2010 was less than 50,000, but after that, the number crossed 100,000. The excitement was such that everyone wanted to go earn money working in the rich Gulf country.
But, as more and more people started to go, another side of the country started to come to light. News of human rights abuse started to appear in different newspapers across the globe. People died due to the harsh working conditions and thousands were injured building infrastructure for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
The Guardian published a report on February 23, 2021, saying that migrant workers are dying unexpectedly in Qatar. This news shed light on the number of Nepalis that died there.
This showed how the Nepal government did not care about Nepalis dying working in temperatures soaring above 50 degrees C. Rameshwar Nepal, South Asia Director of Equidem International, an international human rights organisation, says Nepal and its policies are weak when it comes to labour diplomacy.
A report published by Equidem on November 10 shows that there has been extreme exploitation of the workers engaged in the construction of the FIFA World Cup stadiums. The report prepared after talking to the workers at eight stadiums from September 2020 to October 2022 suggests many were put to work in temperatures above 50 degrees C. It is mentioned in the details that many were not paid on time and some were not paid at all while a lot were told they would be fired if they did not work or complained too much.
Anish Adhikari, who worked at the Lusali Stadium where the final match of the FIFA World Cup will be played, told Equidem that he was not paid.
“I was not paid what I was promised. I was told I was being recruited for one thing, but when I got to Qatar, I was asked to do something else,” says Adhikari, adding the living conditions were pathetic as many were not even given proper food to eat.
Things got so out of hand in the past few years that companies banned workers from speaking to a team from FIFA visiting Qatar to see if news of worker exploitation were true.
A Nepali who works at Al Thumama Stadium in the run-up to the FIFA World Cup tells about his pain with Equidem and says, “After I got tired while working, the boss came and threatened to cut my salary for two days and sent me to Nepal.”
According to the data given to The Guardian by the Nepali Embassy in Qatar, 1,641 Nepali workers died in the ten years between 2011 and 2020. Ghal Singh Rai, who came to work at the Education City Stadium, which was being prepared for the FIFA World Cup, died of suicide within a week of his arrival in Qatar.
The Qatari government has been saying that the deaths of migrant workers were due to natural causes and diseases. However, organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Labor Organization (ILO) have been saying that the migrant workers died because they were forced to work in the heat, exploited and were not provided with good food and healthcare.
Qatar demanded 30,000 workers just to build the stadiums needed for the FIFA World Cup 2022. Most of them were Nepalis, Bangladeshis and Indians. In a report published by Amnesty in 2016, a Nepali worker working at the Khalifa Stadium complained about not getting their wages.
“My family has become homeless, my children have been expelled from school. I am stressed every day because of this torture,” the worker told Amnesty.
The International Labor Organization says the reason migrant workers died in Qatar was the inhumane treatment by the state. According to the ILO, in order to avoid paying compensation after the death of the worker, Qatar claims that the death was due to natural causes and illness instead.
The Foreign Employment Board has recorded that 582 Nepali workers died in Qatar from 2011 to 2021 due to natural illness. According to the data, 1,883 Nepalis lost their lives in Qatar from 2011 to 2021. More than 400 Nepalis were injured in this period.
The Foreign Employment Board, however, says only 1,865 families were compensated.
A report published by the ILO in October 2019 showed that workers’ internal body temperature reaches 38 degrees Celsius when they have to work in the hot sun and workers die due to hyperthermia.
Dr Anup Subedee says that mental stress added to hard physical work in extreme heat will cause heart problems.
“After working hard for a long time in the hot sun, the body will definitely get weak and that affects the heart,” says Subedee.
This is why Human Rights Watch strongly objected to the fact that Qatar said that people who died of cardiac arrest and hyperthermia as natural deaths. It has been demanding an impartial investigation into the deaths of workers in preparation for the FIFA World Cup, 2022.
According to the Foreign Employment Board, the number of deaths and injuries may be higher. “We only have the data of those who died abroad and applied for compensation during the period of the contract and within one year of the end of the contract,” says Maiya Kandel, the information officer of the board, “Not all relatives of workers who died abroad reach us.”
Following an outcry from human rights organisations from around the world, Qatar loosened some of the laws imposed on migrant workers in late 2017.
Qatar started by changing the Kafala system which holds them hostage and prohibits workers from working under the open sky during the summer. However, by the time this reform was made, the hot Qatari sun had already destroyed thousands of Nepali lives.
Amnesty International accused Qatar of trying to escape from paying compensation by treating the deaths of workers who died due to extreme heat as natural.
“This is a violation of labour rights. It also tries to block the way of legal treatment and compensation for the victim’s family,” said an Amnesty report.
According to Qatari law, if a worker dies due to natural causes, no compensation shall be given to the worker’s family.
Income from foreign employment accounts for a large part of Nepal’s economy.
According to the Nepal Living Standards Survey, 2011, 17 per cent of the total household income is covered by remittance. This accounts for one-third of Nepal’s households.
Despite the death of thousands of workers who play an important role in the country’s economy, the government of Nepal has also remained silent.
In 2005, a labour agreement was signed between Nepal and Qatar. It was only in 2010 that Qatar, which is considered a relatively safe destination for Nepali workers, was chosen to host the FIFA World Cup 2022. After that, the death rate of Nepali workers in Qatar also increased.
After the death rate increased, the government planned to place health workers in embassies located in key labour destination countries. The plan was made in 2019 as the government felt Nepalis abroad did not receive healthcare on time and even if they did get treatment, it was difficult because of the language. However, this plan was not implemented.
In November 2017, Qatar promised to improve workers’ conditions by signing an agreement with the ILO. However, international human rights organisations have alleged that Qatar has not fulfilled this promise in its rush to host the FIFA World Cup. Two years after Qatar promised not to make workers work in the summer sun, on October 2, 2019, 24-year-old Nepali Rupchandra Rumba, who worked at Qatar’s Education City Stadium, died, reported The Guardian.
Qatar deported 60 Nepali workers in August 2022 who protested against working conditions. This was seen negatively in Nepal and the world as many Nepalis who built these stadiums for the FIFA World Cup will not get to watch a single match in it.
Saru Joshi, an expert on foreign employment matters, says Qatar dismissed the deaths of migrant workers as natural and heart attacks while preparing the necessary infrastructure for the World Cup.
“For Qatar, the FIFA World Cup is bigger than human lives,” says Joshi.
She also blames the Nepal government for its role in this as it did nothing despite knowing that Nepalis were dying in Qatar,

Nepal’s 14-member team for the upcoming ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 series against Namibia and Scotland in Windhoek has been announced.
The series will take place in Windhoek in Namibia from December 1 to December 8.
The team led by captain Rohit Paudel includes newcomer Nandan Yadav, who will hope to make his debut for the national team. Yadav has represented Nepal in different age groups over the years.
While Yadav has been called up to fill the void of an all-rounder, players like Bhim Sarki, Adil Alam and Kamal Singh Airee have been left out of the team even though the three were part of the Ssixer ODI Series against the UAE held in Kathmandu earlier this month. The trio did not play a single match.
Out of the 16 players who played in the series against the UAE, 13 remain in the team. When asked why the three were dropped, coach Manoj Prabhakar said players like Alam were more appropriate for T20 cricket.
All-rounder Harishankar Shah, who made his debut in the UAE series, also continues in the team as new coach Manoj Prabhakar emphasises the need for more all-rounders.
The Nepali team under the captaincy of Paudel includes Aasif Sheikh, Arjun Saud, Gyanendra Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee, Aarif Sheikh, Kushal Bhurtel, Gulshan Jha, Nandan Yadav, Lalit Rajbanshi, Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Harishankar Shah and Sagar Dhakal.
Nepal will play their first match against the home team, Namibia, on December 2. Similarly, they will play against Scotland on December 4, Namibia on December 7 and Scotland on December 8.
Nepal are currently sixth in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 table with 17 points from 20 games. The top three will directly get entry into the Global World Cup qualifiers. To finish in the top three, Nepal have to win all its remaining games.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/icc-mens-cricket-world-cup-league-2-nepal.html,sports

Nepal beat UAE by 6 wickets to win Ssixer ODI Series,"Friday, November 18, 2022","Kathmandu, November 18
Nepal won the Ssixer ODI Series beating the UAE by 6 wickets at TU Cricket Ground on Friday.
The three-match series was tied 1-1 before this game. This is the first bilateral ODI series win for Nepal at home.
Winning the toss, captain Rohit Paudel put the UAE to bat first. That turned out to be a masterstroke as Nepal took full advantage of seaming conditions and took three early wickets as Sompal Kami and Gulshan Jha sent back the top order within the first four overs.
Rohan Mustafa and Alishan Sharafu steadied the innings, but their 63-run stand was broken by Diprendra Singh Airee sending back Mustafa for 24. Wickets kept falling regularly thereon in as Airee, Dinesh Rajbanshi and Kushal Bhurtel sent back the middle over cheaply.
A last-wicket 83-run stand between Aayan Afzal Khan and Hazrat Bilal saved the UAE’s face in the last match of the Ssixer ODI Series as visitors managed to reach a respectable 176 runs in the allotted 50 overs.
In reply, Nepal managed to chase the total easily. Openers Arjun Saud and Aasif Sheikh were cautious at the start, but the former got out quite quickly. Sheikh then took Nepal’s innings forward along with former-captain Gyanendra Malla who was at his former best as he played shots to all parts of the ground and scored a half-century after 2021.
The two’s 122-run stand led Nepal to the victory of the Ssixer ODI Series as the hosts managed to reach the total with 6 wickets and 59 balls to spare.
Sheikh was announced as the player of the match for his 119 balls 88.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-win-uae-ssixer-odi-series.html,sports
How to watch FIFA World Cup live in Nepal? Your FAQs answered,"Thursday, November 17, 2022","The biggest event in world football, the FIFA World Cup, is starting in Qatar on Sunday. It is estimated that more than half of the world’s population will watch the World Cup live this time.
World Cup fever has engulfed Nepal too as restaurants, shopping malls and the streets are full of flags of countries taking part in the football festival.
So how can you watch the World Cup live? Which TV channel will show it? Do you have to pay for it?
All these questions have been answered below:
The Qatar World Cup will be exclusively shown on Himalaya Premium HD, a new television channel being launched for this World Cup. Along with this, you can also watch live broadcasts of football in public places like cinema halls, restaurants, hotels etc. In some of these places, it may be necessary to obtain permission from Media Hub, the official licence holder to show the FIFA World Cup live this time.
Like other Nepali television channels, Himalaya Premium launched by Himalaya Television Network will be available on all TV networks. An agreement has been made with cable TV operators such as Net TV, Via TV, Dish Home and Clear TV to show the Himalaya Premium channel broadcasting the FIFA World Cup live.
To get the channel, you will have to pay Rs 500 plus taxes. Although there was a legal dispute about this payment, it has been all settled now. Call your cable TV operator for more detail.
This time, FIFA, which runs the World Cup football, has sold separate ‘rights’ for each country for broadcasting the World Cup live on televisions, radios, mobile phones and the internet. Through the sale of these rights, FIFA has collected around USD 3 billion from 223 countries around the world. The Indian company, Viacom 18, has purchased rights from FIFA to show the live broadcast of the World Cup in South Asia. Media Hub has bought the rights from Viacom 18 to show the World Cup live in Nepal.
Open the link to see the list of which companies have obtained the rights in which countries
This time, FIFA has sold live football broadcasting rights separately for television, radio, mobile and the internet adding a geo-lock system. In other words, the company that has acquired the right to show the World Cup live in one country can broadcast in that specific country only.
In India, Viacom-18 is showing a live telecast of the World Cup on the Sports-18 channel, a channel that does not operate in any other country except India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Since the channel is not available in Nepal, you will not be able to watch it in Nepal.
FIFA has sold the rights to every country with a geo-lock system. For that reason, no one else can broadcast live football on social networking sites. In addition, if the World Cup is shown live on social media sites, the artificial intelligence (AI) of social networks will detect it immediately and end it. The account or page showing the World Cup live will also be banned.
No. FIFA has locked the territory when selling television rights and since Media Hab has the right to broadcast football live in Nepal, it is not possible to watch football on Indian channels in Nepal as before. Apart from that, Sports-18, which is owned by Viacom-18, and has the right to broadcast live football in India, is not even available in Nepal. Apart from Sports-18, no other channel has the right to telecast the World Cup live in India.
Yes. This time, you have to pay to watch the World Cup. This time, the live broadcast can be watched only after the consumer pays a fee of Rs 500 per plus taxes per set-top box.
Apart from the monthly subscription charge, you will have to pay your cable operator an extra Rs 500 plus taxes to watch the World Cup. After you pay them, Himalaya Premium will appear on your television sets, where you can watch the matches. For more information, call your cable operator.
Well, you have never been able to watch World Cup football for free. Previously, the cable operators included the fee of the World Cup live in the monthly subscription fee they charge.
For example, in 2018, Sony Television had the rights to broadcast the World Cup in India and Nepal. Cable operators in Nepal pay millions for Sony television channels every year and Sony Sports was showing the World Cup.
However, this time, Indian channels operating in Nepal do not have the right to show the World Cup live.  This means you will have to pay extra to watch it in a pay-per-view model.
This fee is not binding for everyone. It is only for those who are interested in watching World Cup football.

FIFA World Cup live dispute: Court scraps previous order to let broadcasters cast the matches,"Wednesday, November 16, 2022","Kathmandu, November 16
The Supreme Court has scrapped its previous interim order about the FIFA World Cup live broadcasting debate, letting broadcasters charge money for casting the matches.
This means each viewer has to subscribe to a new channel to watch the World Cup matches beginning Sunday at the cost of Rs 500.
A division bench of justices Prakash Kumar Dhungana and Manoj Kumar Sharma issued the order.
Earlier last week, the Supreme Court issued an interim order asking the media agency, Media Hub, to not collect fees from the audience for watching the FIFA World Cup live. Following that, the company exclusively licensed to telecast the global event in Nepal said it might not be possible to broadcast the matches free of cost.

"Ssixer ODI Series: Nepal beat UAE by 3 wickets, level series","Wednesday, November 16, 2022","Kathmandu, November 16
Nepal have levelled the Ssixer ODI Series defeating the UAE by three wickets in the second match of the three-match series held at TU Cricket Ground on Wednesday.
Batting first, the UAE had given Nepal 192 runs to chase, which the hosts chased with 13 balls to spare.
Compared to the first ODI event between the two on Monday, Nepal’s bowler restricted the visitors, who were off to a solid start thanks to openers Vriitya Aravind and Muhammad Waseem, who put up a 72-run stand, to a below-par score.
But, once Nepal picked up Aravind, wickets kept coming as spin bowling of Dipendra Singh Airee, Lalit Rajbanshi and Kushal Bhurtel restricted the hosts to a poor total.
Bhurtel, known for his batting, impressed with the ball as he gave away only 28 runs in seven overs picking up his first ODI wicket. Apart from that, Rajbanshi and pacer Sompal Kami picked up three wickets each while Airee, Karan KC and Gulshan Jha picked up a wicket each.
In reply, Nepal did not have the best of starts, losing openers Arjun Saud and Aasif Sheikh in the first five overs.
Wickets kept tumbling regularly as Nepal had lost half their sides by the 25th over. The innings, however, was rescued by Aarif Sheikh and Jha, who put up a 62-run stand for the seventh wicket, with Jha scoring the majority of the runs scoring 37 in 49 balls. Jha was also announced as the player of the match.
By the time Jha got out, the game was in Nepal’s hand as Sheikh’s 58-ball 33 took Nepal home with over two overs to spare.

"SSixer ODI series: UAE beat Nepal by 84 runs, take 1-0 lead","Monday, November 14, 2022","Kathmandu, November 14
Rohit Paudel’s first match as Nepal’s new captain came to a losing start as the UAE beat Nepal by 84 runs in the first match of the SSixer ODI Series held at TU Cricket Ground in Kathmandu on Monday.
Winning the toss, Paudel asked the UAE to bat first. Openers Muhammad Waseem and Vriitya Aravind gave them a great start as they put up a 76-run partnership for the first wicket. Even though both got out missing out on their half-centuries, Rohan Mustafa steadied the innings with his 73-ball 53. A few run-outs caused issues for the visitors but a late burst from Ahmed Raza pushed them to a par score of 267.
Nepal’s bowling didn’t look the best as both Karan KC and Sompal Kami struggled. Gulshan Jha did his best picking up two wickets as did Lalit Rajbanshi and Dipendra Singh Airee with their economical spell. But with KC and Kami misfiring, Nepal relied more on their fielding to get wickets with three of the seven wickets being runouts.
In reply, Nepal were off to a horrible start as they lost Aasif Sheikh, Gyanendra Malla and captain Paudel in the first 10 overs. A resilient partnership between Arjun Saud and Airee looked to steady Nepal’s innings but as they kept losing wickets, they never got a sniff at victory as they only managed to score only 179 runs in 50 overs.
The UAE’s Aayan Afzal Khan bowled superbly as he picked up four wickets for just 14 runs in his 10 overs winning him the player of the match award. Zahoor Khan, Mustafa, Basil Hameed and Raza helped as they chipped in with wickets, which meant the hosts lost by 84 runs.

"Nepal’s 1st pump track, built by a Swiss company, pumps up cyclists and skateboarders","Thursday, November 10, 2022","There is a small crowd gathered near the bank of the Bagmati river near Kupandol in Lalitpur. The crowd has bicycles and skateboards with them as they wait to inaugurate the country’s first asphalt pump track.
Everyone is excited; after eight days of working hard in the sun, the track is ready, and those who volunteered to help build it are the first to try it.
“It feels great. The track looks good and I can’t wait for people to try this. This is going to be great for the mountain biking community. It will help us grow a lot,” says Abishek Mainali, a mountain biker and a volunteer, after taking a lap on the track.
The pump track is part of Velosolution’s Pump for Peace project through which the company aims to build pump tracks in underdeveloped countries with aim of making cycling and action sports more accessible than ever before. And, in a bid to help the cycling and mountain biking community in Nepal, it has brought the project and in little over a week, completed it.
“We hope more and more kids come here and cycle or skate. The excitement was great and we hope the community benefits from our work here,” says Claudio Caluori, the founder of Velosolutions.
The Pump for Peace project, according to Caluori, started when the company was building a pump track in Thailand. There, it saw how interested young underprivileged kids were to try it.
“These kids near the border between Thailand and Cambodia were so excited to try it. The joy on their faces to ride bicycles on a pump track was great to see. From then, we decided that we would do our bit and try and build tracks in these communities so that these kids could use it free of charge,” says Caluori.
The project built its first track in Lesotho in 2018. Since then, there have been two more tracks in Lesotho, three in South Africa, three in Israel and one in Armenia.
The project in Nepal has been in the pipeline for over three years. Different issues including the Covid pandemic meant they had to delay it.
Caluori says he was contacted by Jenny Caunt from Himalayan Single Track. He came to Nepal in 2019 to even see a few areas but as the project had to be halted, he choose a different destination for it.
“We have one criterion; the location needs to be accessible to all. And, this felt quite central and I want to really thank people like Jenny and Jay who made this possible.”
He also thanks the High-Powered Committee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilisation for providing land for the project.
To build the pump track, Caluori and three members from Velosolutions came to Nepal. Here, they were helped by people from the mountain biking community to build the 170-metre-long track.
Caluori and his team from Velosolutions say this project is a collective effort and hope that people build relationships around the track.
As per preliminary calculations, the project has spent around USD 100,000 in Nepal. The fund was generated with the help of a mountain bike accessories company, Crankbrothers.
Despite the cost, the project wants to keep the place free for all age groups and free of cost too. It wants it to be as accessible as possible as it is the best way to get into any of the biking or skating sport.
“We want this place to be very inclusive. Sure, it’s good for the sport, but I personally to see the community grow,” says Bojan Magister, a member of Velosolutions.
“You don’t need any expensive gear as people with basic bicycles can ride around the track. All you’ll need is a helmet,” says Caluori.
Raj Gyawali, a tourism entrepreneur and mountain biking campaigner, says the track will help the future generation a lot as it helps build the basics for those who want to get into the sport as those who ride on a pump track can handle their bikes on the trail.
“It strengthens their body and legs and prepares them. This track is great news for the community,” says Gyawali.
The track can be used both by beginners as well as pros. People can start slow without taking risks but after learning the basics, the riders can try different like and jump.
“It will never be boring and after learning this skill, you can go to the forest or hills to do down hills,” Caluori says.
Now, Caluori hopes that he can bring a global qualifier to Nepal and host it on the pump track here. The winner of the qualifier will then take part in the Pump Track World Championship.
“One male and one female will get entry. I hope we can make it happen here,” he says.
But for now, bikers are just happy that they have a place within the city where they can polish their skill through which they can compete in races abroad. Mainali feels the track will improve the core strength of many riders and is confident that their racing skills will improve as a result.
“I’m sure even current athletes will benefit from this,” he says.
But, as Pump for Peace wants, the track will be accessible for all. That could be seen when a person with no legs came on his skateboard and went around the track with a bright smile on his face.
“That is what we want to achieve through this,” says Caluori.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-1st-pump-track-lalitpur.html,sports

With the rape charge against suspended Nepal cricket captain Sandeep Lamichhane entering the court, the national cricket governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), has begun discussions on his successor.
The association is under pressure to pick the skipper as it has already scheduled a three-match ODI series with the United Arab Emirates from November November 14 to 18 in Kathmandu.
Different sources reveal that the Nepal cricket board will select the new captain from among former skipper Gyanendra Malla, former vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee and young Rohit Kumar Paudel who captained the national team for a few recent matches in Lamichhane’s absence.
Malla was the captain of the team before CAN took action against him and picked Lamichhane to replace him after he engaged in a dispute with the Nepal cricket governing body’s leadership. After a hiatus of months, he is back to the team from the Kenya tour in August.
Paudel, meanwhile, captained the team during three 50-over matches in Kenya, and Nepal won the series under his leadership. Before this also, he has consistently shown a promising cricket career.
Airee, Malla’s deputy during his captaincy, has also made a promising comeback as he has recently scored a century in the PM Cup.
CAN Acting Secretary Prashanta Bikram Malla says the new captain will soon be selected in consultation with the coach and the selection committee.
“We will select 24 players for the training to prepare for the UAE series. From among them, the 14 will be selected from the final squad,” Malla says, “But, picking someone for captaincy is a serious issue; we need to be farsighted. Hence, it is taking time.”

Sharmila Roka Magar: How a Nepali cricketer walked 23 hours to play in the National Games,"Wednesday, October 19, 2022","When Sharmila Roka Magar left Bhairahawa to celebrate Dashain with her family in Rolpa, she was not as happy as she would be any other year. She spent a lot of time and effort to ensure she would make the Lumbini provincial cricket team for the ninth National Games, but there were no assurances and she was worried sick.
If she was selected, she would have to go to Pokhara from Rolpa as soon as Dashain was over. She did not want to go, but as her brother insisted, she could not say no as she had not been to Rolpa in years as she was studying in Kathmandu. So she told her brother she would go as long as they return on October 5.
On October 4, Magar received a call from the team’s coach, Sanju KC. Her heart was racing, but when KC told Magar she had been selected, she was over the moon. Excited, she told KC she would arrive in Dang by the evening of October 5.
She did not realise what it would mean the next day.
The weather was all fine during the day, but by the time the sunset, it started to rain. Not only it started to rain, it started to pour down heavily.
It rained the entire day the next day. Landslides were reported in different areas, which meant that no bus or SUV could come. Due to the incessant rain, the mobile network was also down. There was no way Sharmila Roka Magar would get to Dang.
“I stayed in Rolpa, hoping the rain would stop, but it didn’t. And when it didn’t I set off on foot in the hope to reach Libang on October 6,” she tells Onlinekhabar in Pokhara.
But, it did not go as planned as landslides had destroyed the roads to such an extent that walking was also considered dangerous. As the rain continued, most landslides were reported.
“Walkling those roads felt unsafe as the landslides were continuing in the same area. So I tried to walk through the forest and got lost multiple times. It was almost impossible to get to Libang,” she says.
Tired and frustrated, Sharmila Roka Magar returned to her sister’s house where she would spend the night. She then walked two hours to get to a place where the phone network was availed and called her coach telling him how it was hard for her to get to camp.
“I wanted to go, but there was no way. I told him. I can’t explain how frustrating it was,” she says.
By October 7, the weather had cleared up a bit and she then decided to rush to Libang. As the usual roads were not operational, she decided to take a different route. Thanks to locals and family members, she reached Libang.
Sharmila Roka Magar had walked over nine hours and her legs were swollen and her shoes had started to wear and tear as they were not meant to walk the trails she had to take.
“I thought I’d reach Dang quite easily from there, but I was so wrong,” she said.
After not finding a bus to get to Dang, she got on a bus to Kathmandu hoping she would get down somewhere. But less than 5 kilometres away, police stopped the bus and told it to turn around as there was a landslide which would take two days to clear.
It was already October 8 and she had to get to Pokhara soon as the first game was on October 10. She had to report by October 9 anyhow.
“The coach told me to get there anyhow but with no roads, I had no other choice,” she says.
Sharmila Roka Magar’s dream of taking part in the national games was hanging by a thread.
On the bus, she met others like her who had to get to Dang. They decided to hire an SUV and take a different route which they hoped would be clear. But halfway, their plans were left in tatters as they saw another landslide. By that time, it was already midnight on October 8. She only had a few hours to get to Dang.
“We decided to walk. That was the only option,” she says.
There were 12 people in the SUVs and all of them started to walk towards Dang. Not stopping for even a minute, they walked all night and reached Holeri at 6 in the morning.
Both of Sharmila Roka Magar’s legs were swollen by then and due to continuous walking, she had bruises all over it too.
“But I was happy I’d made it as I knew getting to Dang would be a lot easier now,” she says.
Sharmila Roka Magar reached Dang, but her team had left for Pokhara already. And, she heard that landslide had obstructed the Lamahi-Ghorahi road sections too.
“Changing one vehicle after another, I reached Pokhara,” she says, with a smile on her face.
It was only when she reached Pokhara that she breathed a sigh of relief. She had left Rolpla 48 hours ago. She walked, took buses and SUVs and walked more to get there. For her, playing in a national-level competition meant a lot.
“I had given up many times, but I wanted to play so bad that I finally made it. I can’t compare this to anything,” she says, adding she will never forget her journey from Rolpa to Pokhara in her life.
Sharmila Roka Magar’s team lost to the APF by 67 runs in the first semifinal match on Monday.

SABA Women’s Championship: Nepal runners-up again,"Thursday, September 29, 2022","Kathmandu, September 29
The Nepal women’s basketball team have finished the SABA Women’s Championship as the runners-up once again.
Defending champions Sri Lanka retained the title as they defeated the hosts, the Maldives, 72-59 during their last match last night.
Also yesterday, Nepal defeated Bhutan 65-26, giving them hope of winning the title. But, Sri Lanka’s victory over the Maldives took them to the top of the scoreboard.
In the event hosted by the South Asian Basketball Association (SABA), four teams–Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bhutan–participated. India chose to withdraw their team at the eleventh hour.
Nepal lost to the Maldives in the first match 51-47, but they won the two others including the champions Sri Lanka 55-49.
“We played after three years and we have mixed feelings… good because we beat Sri Lanka for the first time but bad because we lost to the Maldives for the first time with some silly mistakes that robbed our gold medal,” coach Bikas Shahi says.
“Because of a lack of practice, we couldn’t do well. Yet, young players such as Anusha Malla and Pratiksha Magar really played well.”

ANFA fixes high ticket prices for Nepal-Bangladesh friendly,"Monday, September 26, 2022","Kathmandu, September 26
Nepal’s football-governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), has fixed high ticket prices for a friendly match to be held between the national men’s teams of Nepal and Bangladesh.
The friendly will be held at the Dasharath Stadium at 5:30 pm on Tuesday.
ANFA says a normal ticket costs Rs 500 whereas two types of VIP tickets cost Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 respectively.
These prices are significantly higher than the rates the football-governing body would fix in the past. For example, a normal ticket for a SAFF Women’s Championship held recently cost Rs 300 and a VIP ticket cost Rs 500.
But, ANFA General Secretary Kiran Rai says, “The normal ticket rate (Rs 500) is okay but not expensive. Of course, the rates for men’s football are higher than those for women’s football.”
He says the VIP seats are priced high as these seats are limited, adding it would help Nepal football grow professionally.
If people cannot afford the tickets, they can watch live broadcasts, according to him.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/anfa-high-ticket-prices.html,sports
"Shooting in Nepal has potential as a sport. But, why has it taken a backseat now?","Monday, September 26, 2022","The sport of shooting in Nepal goes way back. Unlike other sports where Nepal just participates, the country’s shooting team actually competed for medals in both the Olympic Games and the Asian Games. There was even an instance when Nepal beat India to win a gold medal in shooting in the South Asian Games.
But, recently, shooting in Nepal has taken a backseat as it is currently fighting for its existence. Lack of infrastructure, equipment and management is killing the sport as those who have given their lives to the sport feel they have just wasted their time. Many have even left the country as they see no hope continue a sport that is discarded by everyone in the country.
In 1991, Anita Maharjan from Nepal beat Indian and Sri Lankan shooters to win the gold medal in the 10-metre air rifle event at the fifth South Asian Games. Two decades on, when Nepal hosted the 13th South Asian Games, the country’s shooting team could not even compete let alone win a medal in any event.
There were even cases where the rifle did not even go off, which shows how irresponsible the Nepal Shooting Association and Nepal Sports Council were in developing the sport of shooting in Nepal.
Shooting is one of the premier events during the Summer Olympics. Nepal has been taking part in shooting events in the Olympic games since 1988 when Parwati Thapa became the country’s first female olympian. Following Thapa, six others have taken part in the games in the shooting events.
In the recently held Olympic Games in Japan in 2021, Kapana Pariyar took part in the 10-metre air rifle event. She was a wild-card entry in the event. She could not do well and many knew she would not do well as she had practised with an old rifle given to her by the army.
“My training wasn’t adequate. Even though I was going to the Olympic games, I didn’t even have modern rifles, which was a major disadvantage for me,” she says.
Pariyar is a member of the Nepal Army. After she performed well during her army training, she was directly sent to the army’s sports department. It has been eight years since she has been shooting but says that nothing has changed in shooting in Nepal when it comes to preparations or training.
“Everything is the same. I train in the same manner when I take part in the national games and the Olympic Games,” she says, stating they have not been able to hire a foreign coach who would help take her and other shooters to the next level.
In other countries, shooting competitions are held regularly. In India, these events are held on a monthly basis and it has helped them improve substantially. In shooting in Nepal, competitions rarely happen. Kathmandu having the only international shooting range in the country does not help the sport either. And as the sport is quite expensive, not everyone has the reach or the will to take part in it. This has resulted in the sport being neglected by everyone.
“If we had competitions in Nepal, things would be different. But, shooting in Nepal does not even have future talents, which the country could groom. This is very sad for the sport,” says Pariyar, adding only the departmental teams (affiliated with Nepal Police, Nepal Army and Armed Police Force) have shooters. “The sport doesn’t have a future.”
And how would there be a future? With no tournaments, the shooters do not earn any prize money to help them sustain and buy better equipment. And as a result, the sport is not attractive anymore for athletes.
“I’m an Olympian, but I don’t feel that. I am in the army, and I’m doing my duty. If we had better infrastructure and foreign coaching, I believe I would do a lot better when I took part in international events,” she says.
A reason why shooting in Nepal has never taken off is the sport just does not have enough players that push each other to succeed. With the sport only being played in Kathmandu, it does not make sense for shooters from other parts of the country to come and train. And, with no sponsors or events to sustain, that is not practical.
Nepal Shooting Association also has not done enough to make the sport appealing at the local and provincial levels. And, with only departmental teams having shooters, shooting in Nepal will not evolve, believe stakeholders.
And, they are right. In Dang, there is hardly any shooting equipment so shooters are using bricks to train. Shooting’s national champion Arnab Ghimire is aiming to win a third gold medal in the upcoming National Games, but as he does not have guns, he feels he might not do as well as he had hoped.
“Dang has two rifles, but both are currently in a sorry state. We have no option but to hope for the best,” he says.
Recently, Asian Shooting Confederation has handed Pariyar some quality rifles, after which she hopes her performance will get better.
“What we’ve been able to achieve is due to our passion. We hope we get more help from the association and the government because we really want to perform better for our country,” says Pariyar.
Nepal Shooting Association’s president Pushpa Das Shrestha says the association is hopeful the newly built shooting range will aim to help create more shooters and overall develop shooting in Nepal. He also hopes the new range and infrastructure will develop the existing shooters in the country.
“We have all the equipment we need for the Asian Games,” he said.
Pariyar also feels that the new range and equipment will help shooting in Nepal, but they need to be taken to other parts of the country too.
In the past, there have been different instances where Nepali shooters have lost before they even went to compete as they had to take part in competitions with outdated equipment.
When Pariyar went to compete in the Tokyo Olympics, she did not have the proper equipment. Even though she knew she would beat a few people, due to her outdated equipment, she was morally down before she competed.
The association’s president Shrestha knows they cannot expect much from shooters like Pariyar as he knows they do not have the proper equipment.
“The equipment we have doesn’t meet the standards set by the International Sports Shooting Federation (ISSF). There have been times we’ve been left redfaced because we were disqualified from taking part due to our outdated equipment,” says Shrestha, adding the association has brought new equipment that meets the standards set by the ISSF.
Shooting coach Upendra Thapa says the development of shooting in Nepal is going at a snail’s pace. But, Thapa, like Shrestha, is hopeful that the new range and equipment will make things easier and help develop both new and current shooters in the country.
He believes the sport should also be introduced at the school and local levels, which will help bring produce more shooters.
When asked why the team did not do well in the South Asian Games and Tokyo Olympics, he said it was mostly due to poor preparation for shooting in Nepal. He says the shooters did not have enough time to practise before SAG and when the Olympics was around the corner, Covid obstructed practice drastically.
“The range in Kathmandu was under renovation so we couldn’t practice as much as we wanted,” says Thapa.
Thapa also believes that the coaching staff also need upgrading to develop shooting in Nepal.
“We seldom get training, but the ones we do get are the national ones. We needed to be trained international too. The association has been positive about this, so, hopefully, we will get the training before the Asian Games,” says Thapa.

Clinical Bangladesh break Nepal’s heart in the final of the SAFF Women’s Championship,"Monday, September 19, 2022","Kathmandu, September 19
Nepal lost yet another final of the SAFF Women’s Championship losing to Bangladesh 3-1 at Dasharath Stadium on Monday.
With this, Bangladesh became only the second team to lift the SAFF Women’s Championship.
Bangladesh opened the scoring early in the first half of the game with Shamsunnahar’s neat finish. Nepal tried to get back on level terms but could not thanks to some resolute defending from Bangladesh.
Both teams were not helped by the waterlogged pitch which slowed the flow of the game. As Nepal were getting into the game, Bangladesh doubled the lead, taking advantage of some poor defending, as Srimoti Sarkar scored in the 42nd minute.
Nepal came out all guns blazing in the second half, creating one chance after another but did not take it. The hosts did score in the 70th minute with Anita Basnet’s cleaver finish. They also created some great chances but Rashmi Ghising and Sabitra Bhandari both failed to convert the chances.
As Nepal were going all out, they left holes in their defence, after which Sarkar scored her second goal of the game all but settling the game and winning the first championship for Bangladesh. With this victory, they became the first team after India to win the championship.
Sabina Khatun, the captain of Bangladesh, finished as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. She was also announced as the tournament’s MVP (most valuable player).

6th SAFF Women’s Championship: Here are 6 new records including the certain new winner,"Monday, September 19, 2022","The ongoing sixth edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship has seen some new records in nine matches in the group stage and two matches in the semi-final.
Now, there is final match remaining and it will surely have a new record. Both the finalists, Nepal and Bangladesh, have never won the SAFF Women’s championship. It means whoever wins will become the new winner this time.
Nepal have reached the final for the fifth time and Bangladesh for the second time after 2016 when Nepal could not reach the final.
So, what are these new records being set in the sixth SAFF Women’s Championship?
The SAFF Women’s Championship will get a new champion in its history of 12 years: either Nepal or Bangladesh.
Previously, India bagged the title of the fifth edition of the championship. Nepal have been defeated four times and Bangladesh one time in the final.
In 2010, Nepal lost 1-0 against India in the final of the SAFF Women’s Championship held in Bangladesh. Likewise, in 2012, they lost 3-1 to India in the championship organised in Sri Lanka.
In the third edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship in Pakistan in 2014, Nepal lost to India 6-0. With this victory, the South Asian giant made a hat-trick in the championship.
In the 2016 edition, Bangladesh reached the final for the first time ultimately to get lost to India 3-1. In 2019, Nepal were defeated by India 3-1 on their home ground.
India have been defeated for the first time in the 12-year-long history of the SAFF Women’s Championship this time. The five-time winner even could not reach the final phase this time.
The other interesting thing about this edition is the South Asian giant lost the match against both the finalists. In the group stage, India were defeated 3-0 by Bangladesh whereas they lost to Nepal 1-0 in the semifinal.
In the 2016 SAFF Women’s Championship, Bangladesh played a draw against India in the group stage before losing to them in the final. Nepal have lost four finals and one semi-final to India.
In 2019, Nepal won over India in Hero Gold Cup held in their (Indian) home ground. At that time, Nepal’s goal machine Sabitra Bhandari aka Samba scored two goals for Nepal. But, this time, in the absence of Bhandari too, Nepal won over India. After the first match of the group stage, Bhandari was infected with dengue.
In this edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship, only the winning teams have scored goals.
So far, Nepal have scored 11 goals. Under the leadership of new captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba, Nepal won three matches without conceding a goal and maintained a clean sheet.
In the group stage, Nepal scored 4-0 against Bhutan, 6-0 against Sri Lanka and in the semifinal 1-0 against India.
Bangladesh in the group stage scored 3-0 against the Maldives, 6-0 against Pakistan and 3-0 against India. In the semifinal, they scored 8-0 against Bhutan.
Likewise, Bhutan and Pakistan also did not concede any goals in their winning matches during the group stage. Bhutan scored 5-0 against Sri Lanka and Pakistan scored 7-0 against the Maldives. Pakistan played football after a hiatus of seven years yet won their first match.
Sri Lanka and the Maldives, during the group stage, faced two and three losses respectively. Sri Lanka conceded 11 goals and the Maldives conceded 19 goals without scoring a single.
Lately, the Bhutan government has been investing well in its football academy. The men’s team have already proven themselves. Likewise, the women’s team of Bhutan won the first match in history and were promoted to the semifinal.
In the first match of Group A, Bhutan lost to the hosts while in the second match they won over Sri Lanka 5-0. Bhutan reached the SAFF semifinal for the first time to get defeated terribly (8-0) by Bangladesh.
For the first time in the history of 12 years, SAFF Women’s Championship has been organised at Dasharath Stadium, Kathmandu. When Nepal hosted the event for the first time in 2019, it took place in Sahid Maidan Stadium, Biratnagar. Prior to that, the championship has been organised by Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India one time each.
This is the biggest women’s football tournament ever held at Dasharath Stadium.
Bangladeshi captain Sabina Khatun has been showing great performance in the ongoing SAFF Women’s Championship. She has scored eight goals that include two hat-tricks, making her the highest scorer in this edition of the championship. Khatun scored hat-tricks against Pakistan in the group stage and Bhutan in the semifinals. Likewise, she also scored two goals against the Maldives in the first match of the group stage while she could not score against India.
Similarly, Nadiya Khan of Pakistan also scored four goals against the Maldives in a group stage.
MS Jahan Shopna of Bangladesh and Anju Tamang of India have scored four goals each.
Similarly, Sabitra Bhandari, Anita Basnet, Amisha Karki and Rashmi Kumari Ghising have scored two goals each for the Nepali side.

Rashmi Kumari Ghising made the decisive goal for Nepal in injury time before the first half concluded to make her team win 1-0. Nepal’s performance in the second half was also commendable.
With this, India have failed to reach the final for the first time in SAFF women’s history.
Now, Nepal will face Bangladesh, who had entered the final by winning over Bhutan in the first semifinal earlier this afternoon, for the title in the final to be held on Monday.

Can Sagar Pun make it to the national cricket team with an aggressive comeback after 4 years?,"Tuesday, September 13, 2022","On September 8, Sagar Pun, who took a rest from cricket for a long time due to a knee injury, made an aggressive comeback. With his contribution of 45 runs (not out), the Non-resident Nepali team started their journey in the 9th National Games with a victory.
The victory did not merely increase the confidence of the team but it also raised hope for Pun to continue his cricket career once again in the national team.
Allrounder player Sagar Pun sustained an injury in December 2018 when his career was at its peak, and it ruined all of his name and the fame he earned with his performance.
The knee injury recovered after a year, but Pun went through a lot of troubles and humiliation. He went to the US after his efforts to join the national team failed. “I was preparing to get back in the national team and began my practice as well, but I couldn’t make it happen,” says Pun.
Sagar Pun is not the first Nepali sportsperson who left the country due to an injury.
Now, he says national players must have easy access to the national team after recovering from injuries. “There must be someone to encourage the injured player, but in my case, there was no one who ask about me,” says Pun. “I was seeking motivation and encouragement rather than financial support.”
Yet, he continued playing cricket in the US. But, he did not get an opportunity to return to Nepal. But, this time, he grabbed the opportunity for the 9th National Games, representing the NRN team. “I was desperately looking for a chance to play cricket again,” says Pun.
The opening match between NRN and Sudurpaschim was dropped to six overs due to the rain. Sagar Pun as an opening batsman scored 46 runs (not out) in 19 balls accompanied by 3 fours and 3 sixes.
The captain of the team Sunam Gautam scored 24 runs. In total, the team scored 74 runs in six overs, losing four wickets. In the second innings, Sudurpaschim earned 62 runs in the six overs, losing six wickets.
The NRN team added two points after winning the match by 12 runs. And, for this, Sagar Pun is very much happy with his comeback as he became the Player of the Match.
“To get a chance to play in the homeland gives me the next level of happiness,” says, adding he badly used to miss Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground of Kirtipur while in the US.
The immediate goal of Pun is to get the victory for the NRN team in the tournament. But, at a personal level, he is already emotional to play in the homeland after a hiatus of four years. He still has hope of playing for the national team. Every player has a dream to play for the national team, and Pun is no exception.

(Updated) Abdullah Al Mutairi says he resigned as Nepal football coach,"Sunday, September 11, 2022","Kathmandu, September 11
Amid reports that the All Nepal Football Association is preparing to decide the fate of head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi, the controversial coach unilaterally says he decided to resign.
“After 525 days in the service of Nepali football, I announce the end of my tenure as coach of the Nepal national team,” he wrote on Facebook, “Thank you to everyone who supported me on this journey that was not without moments of joy, love, sadness and pain.”
An ANFA source says it is now looking forward to hiring a European coach.

Kathmandu, September 11
Nepal football-governing body, All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), says it will decide whether to continue working with controversial football coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
Al Mutairi, who has been constantly controversial since his appointment in Nepal in early 2021 is highly unlikely to return to Nepal as the coach. Following the Nepal football-governing body’s election in June, there is no favourable environment for his return to Nepal.
Further, Pradip Humagain has already been appointed the national team’s interim coach and he has already begun training.
ANFA spokesperson Suresh Shah says the football-governing body is keen to finalise the issue as soon as possible. “The procedure is underway,” he tells Onlinekhabar, “It might take one month at most.”
A probe committee has already told the football-governing body to find alternatives to the controversy king after 10 players accused him of misbehaviour and left the camp.
Abdullah Al Mutairi was sent by Qatar for Nepal’s football development under a memorandum of understanding signed between the two countries. Hence, Nepal cannot independently terminate the contract signed with him.
Meanwhile, ANFA President Pankaj Bikram Nembang had a meeting with the QFA President Hamad Bin Khalifa Bin Ahmad Al Thani in Doha on Saturday. During the meeting, he asked Al Thani to help ANFA conclude the controversy soon, informs a source privy to the meeting.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/anfa-deciding-abdullah-al-mutairi.html,sports

"Nepal fails to provide mental health support to players, and it’s costing the country medals","Monday, September 5, 2022","Nepal’s taekwondo star Sangina Baidya’s career was at its peak in 1998. She was ranked number one in Asia and had the potential to bring home a gold medal from the Asian Games.
However, she got badly injured in a road accident while she was preparing for the event, which later developed into a mental health issue. She had had leg surgery after the accident, which did heal gradually. Nevertheless, the pain of missing the opportunity to bring home the gold medal could not be overcome.
Baidya’s sisters used to convince and motivate her by saying that she would be able to play the game again, but she was confident. “Watching the match that I was supposed to participate in on TV made me sad,” says Baidya.
Thankfully, Baidya had a supportive family who helped her strengthen her mental health to get back to sports. Yet, today, she feels that she could have recovered earlier if she had been counselled by a psychologist.
There are many other players like Baidya who have gone through mental health issues during different times of their careers. Stakeholders hence highlight the need for strong mechanisms to help the players in difficult times.
Psychological/psychosocial counselling and therapy are necessary for people who cannot focus on sports due to various mental health issues. Social backgrounds, financial problems and family issues can be developed into mental health issues, barring the players from focusing on the game.
Baidya, who is also deputy director of the training and coaching department of the National Sports Council now, recalling the incident, says she was able to return to the game just because of her family and Babu Kaji Shrestha, a doctor at B&B Hospital. If it had been the case with other players, the comeback could have been impossible.
Thanks to the support, Baidya bagged gold medals in the 8th and 9th South Asian Games. Likewise, she also became the first Nepali athlete to participate in the Olympics.
“In the past, we did not allow other players to dominate us psychologically. We used to feel that we were no less strong than anyone,” Baidya says, “But, today’s players have sufficient technical knowledge, but they lack confidence. Due to this, even the players who perform well in domestic matches cannot maintain their consistency in international games.”
Rita Maiya Prajapati, a former national table tennis player, also dubs Baidya. “Due to a lack of mental health support such as therapy and counselling, we are losing in most international matches,” says Prajapati, who is also a sports expert at National Sports Council.
“Even the best players cannot perform well in international matches. The environment and society there make us hopeless and we cannot perform well.”
Lately, psychosocial counselling is being conducted prior to any international matches. The council conducted psychosocial counselling for mental health support even before the 13the South Asian Games, she adds.
From the grassroots, it is essential to make players strong both physically and mentally. But, Prajapati believes that the government’s effort to do so is insufficient. “Giving psychosocial counselling to only national players is not sufficient,” says Prajapati.
“Sometimes, players could face a personal problem and in such a situation, personal counselling should be provided.”
It is learnt that the irregularities of tournaments, financial crisis and unemployment compelled Sanju Chaudary, a national weightlifting champion, to kill herself.
Studies suggest that most female players stop playing after the age of 20. But, Prajapati says this is just because of the inadequacy of mental health support including counselling.
But, the council does not have the mechanism to identify problems and provide support.
The only time Pratibha Mali, a member of the national women’s volleyball team, got psychosocial counselling in the eight years of her career was during the 13th SAG. But, this was just a lecture, which was insufficient.
“The financial problem also creates mental health issues among the Nepali players,” says Mali. “Unable to be selected in a team and inconsistency in performance add more pressure on the players.”
Mali says that the players can give their best only if their mental health status is strong. “It is not necessary that only a psychologist or psychosocial counsellor can help them,” she says, “But, the family, friends, coaches and managers can also play a significant role in making them mentally strong.”
In 2019, Mali’s career was challenged after she was badly injured in a club championship. “Back then, I felt like I would never be able to play again. At that time, I used to feel suffocated.”
But, the support from family, the volleyball association and the coach made Mali easy to continue playing. She also agrees that due to a lack of psychosocial counselling, Nepali players have been weak at international tournaments.
The performance of other players makes us feel weak and we cannot perform well, she adds.
A psychologist at the council, Ramesh Khanal, says he holds sessions for only those who personally come to him although he also agrees that weak mental health conditions greatly affect their performance. “Despite having potential, Nepali players are affected by anxiety,” says Khanal.

"Back from CCC UTMB Mont Blanc race, Sunmaya Budha says she wants to be world number one","Sunday, September 4, 2022","Kathmandu, September 4
Nepal trail runner Sunmaya Budha says she has a dream to be the world’s number one runner.
Budha arrived in Kathmandu after completing the CCC UTMB Mont Blanc race in France on Thursday last week. Budha had finished the race in the second position after completing the 101-km race in 11 hours and 45 minutes, just five minutes behind the winner.
“But, now, I want to be the world’s number one. For that, I need to work hard.”
Yet, Budha says she had not dreamed of coming second. “I was committed to giving my best performance time-wise,” she says, “But as I ran, I got more energy and motivation.”
A native of Jumla in Karnali, Sunmaya Budha started running at a very early age. She first ran in school events. Then, she got the chance to run in the President Running Shield, a grassroots event for runners that takes place at all local units across Nepal.
She was only 13 and performing well in this competition, she started to catch the eye of people around. One of them was Hari Bahadur Rokaya, former Olympian, long-distance runner and three-time Everest Marathon winner, who was also a coach at National Sports Council. He wanted Budha to join the running club.

Mustang Golf Course: World’s highest-altitude golf course holds new promises in popular tourism destination,"Sunday, September 4, 2022","When Shyam Tamang registered his name for the recently held golf tournament in Mustang, he had a lot of doubts regarding the standard of the Mustang Golf Course. There were valid reasons for him to be doubtful. The course was relatively new and as it was situated at an altitude of 4,645 metres, there were doubts about how it would play through given the hard weather in the region.
“Whenever you hear Mustang, the first thing that comes to mind is the rugged terrain. I was afraid that my golf club’s iron would be damaged,” says Tamang.
But, when Tamang reached the course on August 26, a day before the tournament, he was pleasantly surprised. After crossing a 3,700-metre hill that was full of rock and sand, he reached a green patch of land where Mustang Golf Course was situated.
“I had a completely different picture of what it would look like. I realised how wrong I was and how making preconceptions was bad,” says Tamang, who recently won the stableford 3/4 handicap event held in the Mustang Golf Course on August 27.
Called the Top of the World Golf Classic, the event was organised with one purpose: to tell the world that a golfing event could be held at Mustang Golf Course which is on the verge of getting into the Guinness Book of World Records. Now, the challenge is to get competitions going on this nine-hole golf course and hold them regularly as many believe that it can be another tourism product for the country.
“It’s great for a place like Lomanthang,” Tamang says. “Everyone looked to enjoy it. The locals wanted this to be a success and I feel it was a very successful tournament.”
The event was a joint effort of the Lomanthang rural municipality and Lomanthang Youth Club where the local youth became caddies for the golfers and the women’s group provided water and other services to the golfers.
“It looked like a joint effort and it was lovely to see men, women and children be a part of history,” says Tamang.
Usually, a golf course is full of greenery. But, Mustang Golf Course is not as green as usual. It’s also quite high, which means people can suffer from altitude sickness.
But, there are ways around it as shown by Rita Thapa, 84, who teed off the tournament. As long as people acclimate well, the altitude will not be an issue, says Tamang.
“I didn’t know that there are such green meadows up there. We have nine holes so far and I think we can make nine more holes and make it the best high-altitude golf course in the world,” says Tamang.
Currently, Mustang Golf Course is on natural grass, but with some investments and the right planning, the course can be developed substantially, he says.
“We can bring in high-quality grass to make the putting green better. That’s the number one priority the course should focus on along with a tee box,” he says.
Comparing the terrain to that of Las Vegas in the US state of Nevada, he feels the course can attract the top professional golfers in the world.
“We need to bring in golfers from around the world and make them members so that they can help make the course better,” says Tamang.
Indra Dhara Bista, a Provincial Assembly member who is also the chief campaigner of the golf course, says he envisioned the Mustang Golf Course project after vising the Arizona desert in the United States of America.
“If they were able to make a golf course there, why couldn’t we dream of making it here,” he says.
The project started in the fiscal year 2021/22 after a budget of Rs 1 million was set aside for it. The budget was used to make tee boxes and holes, cut grass and create a putting green.

“Since our terrain is a bit rough, we couldn’t make the putting green as flat as we wanted,” says Bista.
Bista says a plan to add nine more holes and make it an 18-hole golf course by using the flat pasture next to the current course is in the offing. But, that needs building a bridge to join the two land plots.
Bista also believes that if Mustang Golf Course is able to get into to Guinness Book of World Records and make an 18-hole course, golfers from around the world will come and that will in turn help promote tourism in the area.
“I want people to come to Mustang to play golf in the same manner they go to Everest,” he says, adding the area has enough hotels to accommodate tourists and golfers.
When asked why they invested in golf, he says all the rich play golf. “We want high-end tourists to visit us. Most rich people in the world play golf as a recreational activity, and we want to tap into that market,” he says.
Mustang Golf Course can also be a boon for Nepali amateur and professional golfers who cannot practice during the monsoon; as it does not rain in Mustang, it can be an ideal place for them, believes Bista.
With all that said, he knows this is just the start and a lot needs to be done. The course requires a lot of development, for which a lot of funds will be needed.
“We will gradually turn this course into a major attraction in the country. We need time and money for that,” says Bista.

Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has fined the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) USD 7,000 for breaching the competition code of conduct during the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers held in Kuwait in June.
AFC has fined ANFA USD 6,000 after coach Abdullah Al Mutairi, who was suspended in the match against Indonesia after receiving yellow cards against Kuwait and Jordan, entered the team dressing room before the match and entered the field of play after the match with an accreditation card which was not validly issued to him.

Sunmaya Budha: Running off an imminent teenage marriage in Nepal for trail running across the globe,"Monday, August 29, 2022","Sunmaya Budha was on the verge of getting married off by her parents when she was in her early teens. Things were almost certain as her family was adamant about the marriage if she persisted in running. But, Budha did not want to get married.
She told her parents she was going to the city to get admitted into a high school. But, she did not and instead joined a running club and started training to get better as a runner. And, since then, she has never stopped.
This Saturday (August 27), after 11 hours and 45 minutes, she finished the 101-kilometre-long CCC UTMB Mont Blanc race in second place. It was only about time that Sunmaya Budha burst onto the international scene and the manner in which she did, finishing the race only five minutes behind the winner shows how much potential the young runner has.
Known as one of the toughest races in the world, this was a great achievement for Budha and as soon as she crossed the finish line she was greeted by her mentors and supporters at the North Face Adventure Team who were elated for her. This was particularly special as Budha as recently as two months ago suffered from a horrible Achilles injury, but defying everyone, she came in second.
For Sunmaya Budha, this was exactly what she had set out to do. Evolving as a runner, she has come a long way since she started running aged 15 and now at 23, she knows that if she continues to push limits as she has always done, she can be an all-time great in a sport that does not get the recognition it should in a country like Nepal.
“We win a lot of races, but people in Nepal don’t care. Sometimes it feels like we’re not athletes. I really hope things changes soon,” Buddha says.
Sunmaya Budha started running at a very early age. Growing up in Pere, a village in northeast Jumla in Karnali, she first ran in school events. Then, she got the chance to run in the President Running Shield, a grassroots event for runners that takes place at all local units across Nepal.
She was only 13 and performing well in this competition, she started to catch the eye of people around. One of them was Hari Bahadur Rokaya, former Olympian, long-distance runner and three-time Everest Marathon winner, who was also a coach at National Sports Council. He wanted Budha to join the running club.
“He had sent a letter to my parents asking them to send me to train, but my mother was afraid that something bad will happen to me and that I would be sold. But eventually, after I finished the 10th grade, I went to Jumla to run,” says Budha.
Joining Rokaya’s school, Sunmaya Budha started to train regularly. She had won a few track events by then and understood running was what she was good at. She says there was no regret in not joining high school because studying never really interested her.
“If I was good at studies, I would have studied, but I knew I belonged on the track.”
Through the club, she started taking place in track events in Kathmandu. She also started to do well in marathons finishing third in Dharan.
“My parents were sad I’d finished third because they didn’t understand what a marathon was and the level of competition I was facing.”
She started to regularly take part in both road races and tracks. People were watching her keenly. After she continued to do well in these races, people in the adventure scene in Nepal contacted her and told her how much potential she had. They even went to her parents to convince them to let Sunmaya Budha run freely.
It was in the Godavari Running Festival when Richard Bull saw what she could do and invited her to go take part in the Manaslu Trail Race. During the seven-day event, she was first every day. This was unprecedented and a lot of people were curious about who she was as she continued to impress.
“One person told Richard that he wanted to sponsor me and send me to other races around the world. Since then, things changed,” says Budha.
After that, Sunmaya Budha took part in various competitions at home and abroad. She has been to China, Oman, Hong Kong and France finishing in the podium places in most of them. In the ones she did not, she still impressed people as she was a young runner.
These accolades were huge given how she started. She says for most of her life she ran barefoot. As a child, in most races she took part in her village, she ran without shoes. Even when she came to Kathmandu to run the 5,000-metre events at Dasharath Stadium, she ran barefoot as she did not know how to run with track shoes. And, barefoot, she even won.
“It was hard during the start. When I started running trails, I did so using shoes I bought for Rs 800 (less than USD 7). Now, thanks to everyone, I run with better shoes.”
Sunmaya Budha says every event she goes to take part in abroad has taught her something new. Yet, she says there is a long way to go. Her recent success in France is proof of her getting better and learning from races she has taken part in Nepal and other countries. She hopes the same fandom can take place in Nepal too.
“We don’t care about trail running. No one knows the potential these types of races have.”
And, she is right. People from all over the world come to attend these races. One event of the Golden Trail Series that took place in 2019 in Mardi Himal was a huge success.
“I too want to run in Nepal with a lot of fans cheering us on. That’s the dream.”
Maybe that dream will soon come true for her. In July 2021, she was signed as an athlete by the North Face Adventure Team becoming the first Nepali woman to have been signed up by the brand in years. North Face Team Director Ryan S Blair, after signing, said how they wanted to support Budha given her potential and ambitions.
Sunmaya Budha’s recent plaudits in France will be remembered for years to come, but a lot of people in the running field knew this was coming.
“I was very impressed by Sunmaya. She may be a bit shy, but she is already very charismatic. I see her winning the world’s greatest races in the coming 10-15 years, with zero doubt. And I hope she can visit Chamonix and run UTMB Mont-Blanc,” UTMB’s Organising Committee member Remi Duchmein said in 2019.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sunmaya-budha-nepal-trail-running.html,sports
"All teams, including suspension-free India, confirm participation in SAFF Women’s Championship","Sunday, August 28, 2022","Kathmandu, August 28
All seven teams have confirmed their participation in the SAFF Women’s Championship to be held in Kathmandu next week.
Whereas India’s participation in the event was ruled out along with the world football-governing body, FIFA’s suspension of the All India Football Federation, the doubts have been cleared with the suspension lifted in less than two weeks.
Defending champions India are believed to be the strongest team among the participants. Despite their weak preparation, Nepal women’s football team have considered Indians as their only rivals.
So far, no team except India have won the SAFF Women’s Championship that began in 2010.
“The decision [to lift the suspension of India] was taken after FIFA received confirmation that the mandate of the committee of administrators that was set up to assume the powers of the AIFF Executive Committee had been terminated and that the AIFF administration had regained full control of the AIFF’s daily affairs,” FIFA says in its news release.
It means there is no doubt about India’s participation, according to a source at All Nepal Football Association (ANFA).
Nepal have been drawn against Bhutan and Sri Lanka in Group B of the SAFF Women’s Championship. Defending champions India are pitted against Maldives, Bangladesh and Pakistan in Group A. The Bhutanese team have already come to Kathmandu.

B-boying in Nepal: A pioneer reviews the struggling past that’s paving the way to the promising future,"Sunday, August 28, 2022","Nishanta Gauchan’s name comes on the top whenever someone talks about b-boying in Nepal. A native of Mustang, he is a first-generation b-boying artist of Nepal and has witnessed all the ups and downs of b-boying in Nepal.
It has been around 14 years since he has been active in the scene. In a recent interview with Onlinekhabar, Gauchan talks about the past, present and future of b-boying in Nepal.
From then to now, Gauchan has seen plenty of changes in the sector. He says there are many b-boying artists in Nepal now who are great in skills and have potential. They are already preparing to compete on a global level as well. The Olympics Committee incorporating b-boying in the upcoming global gala has left him elated. As a Nepali b-boying artist has won a scholarship for the event, he says many upcoming talents will get inspiration from him.
Hence, he says, gradually, the number of local platforms for b-boying artists is also increasing.
But, Gauchan recalls the negative narrative in peoples’ minds about b-boying in Nepal. Most of them used to reckon the b-boying artists as junkies and school dropouts. However, today, there are also b-boy artists who are engineers, entrepreneurs and managers.
“Some of the people even used to call us foreigners, looking at our dressing styles,” says Gauchan. According to him, the number of b-boying artists in the country is increasing, whose number might have reached over a thousand by now.
Lately, things have relatively changed as far as b-boying in Nepal is concerned. “There are many people at present who properly grasp the dance form as an art, which is positive.”
Meanwhile, the parents have become supportive; they want their children to learn b-boying. They take their child to the dance institution that teaches b-boying. These things make Gauchan happy. He informs that the scene is also equally growing outside the Kathmandu valley in places like Pokhara, Butwal, Bhairava, Surkhet, Dang, Dharan and others.
Prior to coming to the hip-hop community in the 2000s, Nishanta Gauchan was a metalhead. He would listen to death metal and black metal for the entire day.
His friend in school recommended to him an album by Dr Dre entitled The Chronic. It inspired him towards knowing more about hip-hop and b-boying.
Gauchan from his early days never wanted to do a nine-to-five job. He had a dream to be involved with any form of performing arts. Subsequently, he also used to get fascinated seeing the artist giving autographs to the fans.
He also had a goal of becoming either a British Army soldier or a pilot. He was more active in football and basketball during school days and was average in his studies.
Gauchan started dancing in 2005; he used to learn dance moves from TV. In 2008, a friend told him about the b-boying battle that was being held in the World Trade Centre. It was the first b-boy battle that ever took place in Nepal. But, due to the delay in registration, he could not participate. In another edition of the same programme, he got a chance to show his performance.
Similarly, in 2009, Gauchan and his crew went to Thailand to participate in a b-boying competition. Then, the crew had a temporary name, which Gauchan cannot recall at present time. It was the first time that Nepal went in any international b-boying competition.
Again in 2011, the crew went to the same country to participate in Battle of the Year, which is a qualifier for the World Championship for South Asian countries. This time, they had a name for the crew — Everest Crew.
The crew wanted to be on the top of the b-boying community and they named the crew after Everest, the highest peak in the world.
“We had a great experience in both of the international events and learnt a plethora of things,” says Gauchan. “The judges in the competition also appreciated our performance, and that motivated us to move b-boying in Nepal forward,”
Currently, there are many platforms to learn various skills including b-boying, but the time was totally different back then. The internet was not accessible as of now. Gauchan and his contemporaries used to learn the moves from the mobile videos received from a friend using Bluetooth.
Likewise, they also used to purchase CDs consisting of videos related to b-boying. But, luckily, Gauchan got a chance to learn b-boying from some professionals based in Thailand.
Anup Prakash alias Mickey, who is also considered the pioneer to introduce b-boying in Nepal, hired some b-boying professionals from Thailand to train Nepali artists.
While b-boying in Nepal is developing quite well, there are some challenges for the ones involved in it. The key challenge is money.
Still, there has not been a condition where b-boying artists can earn enough even by dedicating their entire time to it. They are compelled to do other jobs to sustain themselves economically. Subsequently, many artists cannot afford to participate in workshops and other events.
Gauchan suggests the artists active in b-boying in Nepal can approach schools and run a class there to overcome the financial challenges. Currently, many schools hold b-boying or dance classes as a part of ECA.
Gauchan also once used to teach in schools, and save money from it to tour and participate in various events.
“Many b-boying artists around the world teach the dance form in schools or are involved in side gigs to sustain their life,” he says.
Yet, overall, he is hopeful that b-boying in Nepal is moving towards a brighter direction and it will not be as problematic as it was in the past.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/b-boying-in-nepal-nishanta-gauchan.html,sports

"Rama Singh, Nepal’s famous newscaster, led the country’s 1st women’s football team. Here’s the interesting story","Friday, August 26, 2022","Little is known about popular newscaster Rama Singh as an established player in Nepal. Before she began her career as a reporter at Nepal Television, she used to be the captain of the country’s first women’s football team in Nepal. From 1982 to 1987, she led the Nepali team and participated internationally.
Recently, she was invited as a guest at a talk programme organised by Nepal Sports Journalist Forum. In the programme, she remembered the initial development of women’s football in Nepal.
In the early 1980s, Nepali women’s football had a big craze. Spectators used to throng the Dasharath Stadium to watch women’s football matches. “It may sound strange now, but the craze for women’s football was different at that time,” says Rama Singh, the first captain of the women’s national football team, with pride.
This was four decades ago. Many things have changed now. The football craze is exactly the opposite. Women’s football craze is much less than men’s. The stadium, which used to be packed to see women play football, looks mostly deserted.
Born in a big family of 13 brothers and sisters, Rama Singh grew up in a modern living style. Her family was so modern that sons and daughters were treated equally although sports for women were very limited in those days outside her house.
After completing her school, Singh joined the Padma Kanya Campus in 1981 to pursue her higher studies.
There, she got a chance to play volleyball. She became a member of the team formed by the college for the first time and played a volleyball tournament at the covered hall in Tripureshwar.
Until then, the women’s national football team in Nepal did not exist. But, seeing the volleyball team, the then president of All Nepal Football Association, Kamal Thapa offered everyone to play football.
But, Thapa was compelled to form a women’s team as soon as possible. “At that time, FIFA warned of cutting the subsidies if any country doesn’t have the women’s team,” Rama Singh says, “Then, the historic women’s team got its shape.”
At that time, most women were limited to the four walls of the house. Hence, ANFA was expecting difficulties in finding enough players. However, players from Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dharan formed a national team for the first time and created history by winning the first match against India invited for the friendly match.
“I still can’t believe it when I remember that day. That craze of women’s football is unforgettable. The stadium was completely packed. There were also supporters outside the stadium too,” adds Singh.
Rama Singh informs Nepal got to play in an international competition in Hong Kong for the first time in 1986. By that time, women’s football teams had been formed in some districts of Nepal. Selecting players from those places and training them for one and a half months, the 18-member team went to Hong Kong to play in the AFC Women’s Championship.
“We also had the enthusiasm to go to international games, but I was afraid. The reason was not being able to create a solid impression because even men’s Nepali team were unable to do so,” says Rama Singh.
At that time, only Nepal and India had women’s teams in the South Asian region. The Nepali players were trained at Mahendra Yuvalaya in Jawalakhel. The players who came from outside the valley stayed there while the players from Kathmandu used to come every day for training.
At that time, Hong Kong and Thailand too formed their first women’s teams. In terms of technology, they were far ahead of Nepal. On the Nepali side, some Nepali players lacked proper football gear such as boots. The jerseys for them arrived 12 hours before the match.
Even if the boots used to be available, there used to be a problem with the size. The Nepali women footballers were not used to playing in new boots, so some players played football in their sports shoes, according to Rama Singh.
“The worst part is that we had trouble running on Hong Kong’s modern and well-organised ground. At the stadium in Nepal at that time, there was a field with mud mounds, grass, and stones. It was difficult for us even to walk on that ground, so how were we supposed to run,” says Singh.
Nepal played the first match against the hosts. This was Rama Singh’s first match as the captain of the team. China, Japan and Korea were other teams.
“We were teased by the journalists as we lost to Japan 0-12. But, it was an achievement for the Nepali team even to participate in an international game,” recalls Singh.
Despite creating history in Nepali women’s football, Rama Singh could not continue her career. The main reason was unprofessionalism. In her experience, football was like an addiction for the players of that time although there was no investment, no competition; one could not expect to get any facility being a player.
During the 3rd National Games (1985), when the female footballers went to Birgunj, they had to spend the night at schools and dharamshalas and had to rest in beds made of straw as there was not any particular department for women’s teams like these days. Today, the players do not have to face that but the facilities provided to them are still not enough, says Rama Singh.
Singh remembers that women players had to fight for their rights at that time. She says, “There was a rule to invest 22 per cent in women’s football, but we didn’t get it.”
Rama Singh came to Nepal after staying in America for almost two decades and she is here to stay. Hence, in the future, she is ready to help in any role for the Nepali women’s football team.
“I have returned to live in Nepal now. If ANFA wants to utilise my expertise, I am always ready to help women’s football as much as I can.”

Nepal women’s basketball team are all set to play an international match after 3 years,"Thursday, August 25, 2022","For the last one and a half months, the covered hall of the National Sports Council has been occupied by the national women’s basketball team. The girls are seen shooting, dribbling and defending the ball in the hall.
After a long hiatus of three years, the team are preparing themselves for an international tournament. While the other sports like cricket and football saw a number of international competitions after Covid, basketballers remained passive and did not get any chance to play in global tournaments for three years.
The last time the team played an international match was in 2019 at South Asian Games, held in Kathmandu where the team bagged the silver medal after losing against India in the final match.
But, Nepal women’s basketball team are now finally preparing for an international tournament, South Asian Basketball Championship (SABA), that is being held in the Maldives in September.
Nepal won the second position in the first edition of SABA held in 2016. Since then, the event has not taken place and it is time for the Nepali team to shine again in the second edition of SABA.
According to Sadina Shrestha, the captain of the national women’s basketball team, they have a lot of challenges and pressure, yet she is confident and determined to win the gold medal.
She says, “The girls have a different level of energy and excitement. It is definitely tough to win the competition but not impossible.”
Talking about toughness, Shrestha says, “The very first challenge is that we are unaware of the exact status of our women’s basketball team because we haven’t played with any international squad for a long time.”
The past three years have been very frustrating for the national women’s basketball team because they were barred from playing at any international level for a long time.
The second challenge is India. Last time, India did not participate but this time there is a higher probability of their participation. So, this is another challenge for the team.
India have always been a giant team in the South Asian women’s basketball scene and to compete against them is a great challenge for all other teams in the region. The South Asian giants currently stand in 58th rank in world women’s basketball while Nepal still remain unranked.
Shrestha, the national women’s basketball team’s captain since 2013, has a dream to bring a gold medal from an international tournament during her tenure.
Nepal so far have not won any international gold medal to date. And, this time, Shrestha profoundly wants to change history.
Meanwhile, coach Bikram Shahi has additional concerns.
In the last three years, Nepal women’s basketball team enrolled many young players. Those players have insufficient experience in playing big matches, and it worries him.
But, he says the Nepali team are a blend of experienced and young players, and he wants to test the status of the team.
“So, now, we are mainly focusing on building a strong formation of the team,” says Shahi. “Despite having many young players in the team, they are progressively maintaining coordination with each other.”
Captain Shrestha also accepts that each day the team’s coordination is improving. The senior players are also helping the young ones to stay motivated and enhance their skills.
Shrestha and Shahi both say that there were some issues in building coordination in the past, but now gradually, things have changed.
In the past, the irregularity in tournaments also affected the fitness of the players. But, the coach says that players’ fitness is improving each day this time.
Another player Anusha Malla also dubs Shrestha and Shahi. She also believes that the lack of experience in big tournaments among the young players is currently a major challenge for the team.
“To combat the challenge, we are preparing ourselves mentally, physically and in every possible way,” she says. “We will give our best.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-womens-basketball-saba-2022.html,sports
Manoj Prabhakar promises stability and plans all-round development to develop Nepal cricket,"Monday, August 22, 2022","After Pubudu Dassanayake stepped down from the post of Nepal national cricket team coach on July 20, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) appointed Manoj Prabhakar for the role.
The former Indian international cricketer had played 39 tests and 130 ODIs for India. He has also coached three Ranji Trophy teams in Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Briefly, he also worked with Afghanistan during the T20 World Cup held in India in 2016.
But, he has been surrounded by controversy. In 2011, he was sacked by Delhi after he publicly criticised the players and selectors. Hence, there are doubts if he can mend problems that the Nepal cricket is going through.
In this context, Manoj Prabhakar has spoken to the Nepali press for the first time as he prepares the team for the bilateral series with Kenya, in which he appeals to Nepali cricket fans to honestly believe in him, claiming he has some promises and plans for them.
For the first time, Manoj Prabhakar has been appointed as head coach of an ODI team. However, the coach believes this is not a new job for him, as whether he gets the role of the head coach or balling coach, his job is to improve the department he has been appointed to.
“Currently, I am working hard in correcting all the mistakes that our boys made earlier,” says Prabhakar. “The team of young players are very positive and eager to learn.”
Prabhakar is enjoying training the Nepali team and he believes the players are also happy with him.
The Nepal cricket team have already seen some foreign coaches over the past years. But, they also suffered from the coaches leaving them halfway. After Dav Whatmore, Pubudu Dassanayake also did the same. However, talking to Onlinekhabar at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Manoj Prabhakar claims that he will not do so.
“The main thing is you have to be professional; when you sign a contract, you have to fulfil everything mentioned in the agreement,” he assures.
In recent times, Nepali national cricket has gone through various ups and downs, but the Indian coach says he is not aware of the fact. “I don’t know the past, but at present, I have got a very young team. They are working hard and making improvements in their game each day,” says Prabhakar.
“They have realised what I want to teach to them and are working on it.”
Yet, the main challenge for Manoj Prabhakar is to make each player realise their responsibility as a team member. He says the day when they realise their job, they will be ready to perform better. “They should know how to face the ball and bowl the ball, ” says Prabhakar.
For this, as a coach, he is focusing on each player’s strengths rather than weaknesses.
According to him, the team currently are in need of a couple of match winners and he has been working on it. Likewise, he is also looking for a number of all-rounders in the team. Being an all-rounder himself back then, Manoj Prabhakar shares, “A team can win the World Cup only when it has a good number of all-rounders.”
Nepal have already played 20 matches of the ICC League 2 and 16 matches are still left to play. In these remaining matches, Prabhkar’s goal is to win the majority of matches to elevate the rank of the team.
With that, Nepal are also set to tour Kenya to play against the hosts. The team will be playing five T20 internationals and three one-day matches.
Manoj Prabhakar says the team have been holding very good preparation although they are yet to fully realise the importance of training.
Meanwhile, to enhance the level of the team, Manoj Prabhakar also has a plan to take benefits from the Nepal T20 League starting next month. “I will watch all the matches and explore all the hidden talents.”
For the talented and potential ones, he will provide an opportunity in the national team. He believes doing so can form an excellent team for the future.
In recent times, some controversy about the lack of unity among the national players got exposed on media and social media platforms. However, the coach has not seen any kind of conflict among the players yet. He says “Everybody is fair and hardworking.”
The former captain of the national team Gyanendra Malla is also included in the current squad. He is back on the team after a long hiatus. Manoj Prabhakar expects that his experience will help all the youngsters and assist in forming a strong team.
With that, he hopes that during his tenure, the Nepali team will also get benefits from the Board of Control for Cricket in India  (BCCI), the Indian cricket governing body.
Lastly, to all the Nepali cricket fans, he says, “Just trust me.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/manoj-prabhakar-nepal-cricket-plan.html,sports
"Nepal’s new football coach is American by law, and he doesn’t have a labour permit to work here","Friday, August 19, 2022","Kathmandu, August 19

Lal Mohar Yadav and his dream of professionalising kabaddi in Nepal,"Monday, August 15, 2022","Recently, Nepali kabaddi player Lal Mohar Yadav has got selected for the ninth season of Pro Kabaddi, a men’s professional kabaddi league in India. He will be playing for the team Bengaluru Bulls.
This is his third association with a foreign team and second with the current team. Yadav first got selected in Pro Kabaddi in 2018 for its sixth edition. Then, he was associated with the team Puneri Paltan. By involving himself in different foreign leagues such as India’s prestigious Pro Kabaddi, Lal Mohar Yadav hopes it will help Nepal professionalise the traditional game that was falsely considered the unofficial national game of Nepal. But, for that, he demands organising domestic league events in the discipline.
Bengaluru Bulls have spent INR 1 million for Lal Mohar Yadav, a 31-year-old raider, for Pro Kabaddi’s season 9 set to begin in September.
While Yadav, a native of Siraha in southern Nepal, has already been selected two times earlier for the league, he has never got a chance to show his performance on the court. And, it makes him sad.
However, this time, he has high hope that he will be given a chance to show his skills in the competition. He is well prepared to give his best in the match.
Lal Mohar Yadav got attention among the selectors of both teams he has been into so far after his performance in the Asian Games of 2018 in Indonesia, where Nepal defeated Malaysia. It was the first time the national kabaddi team won against any big team. Yadav’s performance in that match was remarkable as it impressed many individuals.
Lal Mohar Yadav never thought that he would become a kabaddi player. But, after joining the Tribhuvan Army Club in 2015, life took an unexpected turn.
Earlier, Yadav was only into wrestling, football and volleyball, but later his bold physique and experience in wrestling in the early days made him choose kabaddi for a further sports career.
After Yadav’s entry into Tribhuvan Army Club as a kabaddi player, the team won gold medals in the seventh and eighth national games. Likewise, they also bagged the first position in National Sports Council Championship.
Yadav says that his earlier experience in football, volleyball and wrestling strengthened his running capacity and stamina, due to which he got easily enrolled in Nepal Army. “Unlike others, I did not have to put in more effort to get selected in the military.”
Although Yadav has not got a chance to play in the league till now, he says he has learnt many things while being a part of it.
“As a part of the league, I got to practise with senior players, which enhanced my skills and there I also developed my communication skills,” says Lal Mohar Yadav.  “Additionally, I also got a chance to communicate with celebrities like Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and Virat Kholi.
This exposure has made Lal Mohar Yadav realise the necessity of the kabaddi leagues in Nepal as well. While India has been organising a kabaddi league for around a decade now, Nepal does not have any league for the sport. Nepali kabaddi is limited to just a few competitions that too rarely take place.
After playing in the 13th South Asian Games of 2019, the Nepali team went to Bangladesh twice to compete in the Bangabandhu Kabaddi Cup. Before that, Nepal played in the 12th SAG in India in 2016 and the 18th Asian Games in Indonesia in 2018.
That means the Nepali kabaddi team have participated in only four international competitions since 2016.
Currently, kabaddi is also included in the President Running Shield, but it has not garnered popularity as other sports. Nonetheless, officials at Kabaddi Association say they are also planning to organise a league similar to Pro Kabaddi.
“For that, a lot of things need to be done,” says Binod Prajapati, the general secretary at All Nepal Kabaddi Association. “We have been holding meetings with sponsors; the league will be announced after signing a deal with them.”
But, Lal Mohar Yadav sincerely hopes this to happen. He believes the leagues not only give a chance for players to play but also help in exploring new and talented players.
“There are a lot of talented kabaddi players in remote parts of the country; the leagues can bring them to the forefront,” Yadav says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lal-mohar-yadav-kabaddi-in-nepal.html,sports

SAFF Women’s Championship 2022: Nepal have nothing but hope for magic to defeat India,"Sunday, August 14, 2022","India’s dominance in all of the sports of South Asia is seen as a hindrance to the success of other countries. Lately, India has been giving a notable priority to the sports sector and its results can be clearly seen in the fields. The upcoming SAFF Women’s Championship is likely to be no different.
A win against India is considered a great success for other South Asian nations. Hence, the Nepal women’s football team are also preparing with an objective to defeat India, but they do not have any special plan.
After a month, the sixth edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship is taking place in Kathmandu. For the second time, Kumar Thapa has been appointed the coach for the Nepali women’s football team for the event.
In the 2014 edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship, the Nepali women’s football team coached by Thapa lost to India in the semifinal. India have defeated Nepal in four finals of the regional event since its first edition in 2010.
Thapa says he wants his team to defeat India although he does not have any special plan. “We are not expecting any magic. There is no magical power to defeat India,” Thapa says, “However, the experience of players, their hard work and playing on the home ground are some of the advantages that might help us in defeating India.”
It has been two weeks since Nepal have started training for the SAFF Women’s Championship. The team have also been trained for one and half months beforehand, concentrating on the Asian Games. This time, hence, coach Thapa is optimistic about the team.
“The players who debuted in 2013 are also in the team. They are well experienced. They have a different approach and use different styles while playing the sports,” says Thapa. “Moreover, the players also have the pain of losing to India every time. Such an ego is also a drive to win, which might also create changes in the upcoming championship.”
Losing to the same team several times can even affect the psychology of the players. Thapa says he has been working on helping them defeat this thought. “We are planning to call a psychologist to provide a class for the players,” says Thapa.
This is the second chance for Thapa to prove himself, who played in the Nepali national team as a midfielder for five years. The AFC A coaching licence holder says, “I have been working systematically to bring good results.”
Thapa says he has seen in his girls the determination to compensate for the losses since 2010.
In April, the Nepali women’s team played their last league game. After two months of the league, their training for the Asian Games began. In the first phase, 40 players were called for training. Their training halted after the postponement of the Asian Games.
Currently, 35 players are in training for the SAFF Women’s Championship taking place from September 6 to 19. The final squad will be made from among these 35 players.
Since the players immediately started training after the league for Asian Games, they are in good form, says Thapa.
Yet, the standard of match relies on the investment made in it. Of late, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India have made remarkable investments in women’s football teams.
“Alongside India, all other countries are equally strong competitors for us,” Thapa says hinting at Nepal’s poor preparation for the SAFF Women’s Championship. Yet, he maintains, “Prior to the match, we cannot tell about anyone’s weakness or strength.”
Group A of SAFF Women’s Championship 2022 includes India, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan while in group B are Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan.
Comparatively, the Nepali team are seen to be in the easy group as they will directly enter into the semifinal with just one win.
But, there are many factors to consider. The home ground is the strongest factor for Nepal. A motivating Thapa says this SAFF Women’s Championship is the best time for players to prove themselves and make Nepali spectators happy and proud. “We will create an identity and make people proud by winning the championship.”
Yet, with just six weeks of training, they are going to the big event.
Hence, the win over the South Asian giant (India) is a challenging goal for Nepal. The structure of domestic football and a lack of investment in women’s football are blocking Nepal from progress, says Thapa.
“There is no regular age-group competition in Nepal. In addition, the national league is also short and irregular. The production of new players is also not happening in a constant way,” says Thapa.
As a result, it is still hard even to find 40 fine women footballers as seen during the recent selection for the SAFF Women’s Championship.
The status of Nepali women footballers would go into crisis if there was no departmental team, he adds.
Usually, players are selected only when the tournaments approach. Thapa says it is a mistake to select the players on short notice. The players coming from different age groups could make the national team stronger, but in Nepal, the case is different because the country does not hold any tournaments according to the age group.
Hence, in this situation, it seems Nepal could only depend on the magic to win the SAFF Women’s Championship title for now.

Nepal national team head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi has responded to allegations made against him by the All Nepal Football Association in regards to not responding to emails sent to him by Nepali football’s governing body.
Writing on Facebook, Al Mutairi said that he has not received any email from ANFA. An ANFA source told Onlinekhabar that it had written to Al Mutairi asking for his comments on the report prepared by the task force that asked ANFA to replace him.
Al Mutairi said that he has received no emails from ANFA and has asked the governing body not to spread misinformation in the media. He said he only received an email after he wrote to ANFA asking the governing body to demand an apology for trying to defame him.
“I have always provided my full effort in building a strong national team of Nepal and have a strong desire to continue until my agreement,” he wrote.
He has accused ANFA personnel of trying to tarnish his reputation and image and said he will go to AFC and FIFA if need be. Al Mutairi also stated that the letter for clarification sent by ANFA did not have a set deadline and said he was talking to his lawyer.
He has also questioned the legitimacy of the task force.
“I have from the start questioned the legitimacy of the task force but have decided to remain silent in good faith. I will respond to the questions posed by ANFA soon,” he said.
ANFA on the other hand said it sent a letter to Al Mutairi after he wrote to it stating he had not received an email. When asked about what happened to the earlier email, a source at ANFA said that it sent the email to an incorrect email address.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/al-mutairi-says-he-didnt-receive-letter-from-anfa.html,sports
"Despite uncertainty over his future, Al Mutairi asks ANFA to call up 26 players","Tuesday, August 9, 2022","Kathmandu, August 9
Nepal’s football coach Abdullah Al Mutairi has asked the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) to call up 26 players for a friendly match later in the year.
He has asked ANFA to call up the players despite the uncertainty over his future.
An ANFA committee had told Nepali football’s governing body to find a replacement for Al Mutairi following his dispute with 10 senior players of the national team in April.
Al Mutairi, who is currently in Kuwait, has only included two of the 10 players that left camp in April – Anjan Bista and Tej Tamang. He has also told ANFA he wants his old coaching staff.
This comes as a shock to ANFA, which is yet to hear from Al Mutairi on the report prepared by the committee that asked ANFA to replace him.
“He’s not answered the questions sent to him by the general secretary. Instead, he’s sending us things he wants us to do. This is very wrong,” said a source from ANFA.
The list includes 20 players that went to take part in the Asian Cup Qualifiers in Kuwait.
An ANFA source told Onlinekhabar that this would be addressed in ANFA’s next executive committee meeting.
“It’s likely that a final decision will be made on Al Mutairi’s future,” said the source.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/al-mutairi-anfa-players-friendly.html,sports
Former Indian international Manoj Prabhakar appointed Nepal cricket coach,"Monday, August 8, 2022","Kathmandu, August 8
The Cricket Association of Nepal has appointed Manoj Prabhakar as the coach of the Nepal national cricket team.
CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand informs Prabhakar has signed a one-year contract.
Prabhakar will succeed Pubudu Dassanayake, who recently resigned from his position and took over as the head coach of the Canada men’s team.
The former Indian international, Prabhakar played 39 tests and 130 ODIs for India. He has also coached three Ranji Trophy teams in Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Briefly, he also worked with Afghanistan during the T20 World Cup held in India in 2016.
But, he has been surrounded by controversy. In 2011, he was sacked by Delhi after he publicly criticised the players and selectors.
Following his appointment, Prabhakar has said he is looking forward to the challenge.
“Seeing the interest for cricket in Nepal, their talent and skill level, I’m really looking forward to working with the Nepal cricket team to make them into a cricketing force to be reckoned with,” he says.
Manoj Prabhakar’s appointment comes at a critical time for the national team which have not been doing great in the past few tournaments.

Mustang plans to boast the world’s highest-altitude golf course,"Monday, August 8, 2022","Kathmandu, August 8
A new golf course is being constructed in the Mustang district of Nepal’s Himalayas, which the planners claim will be such a facility at the highest altitude in the world.
Currently, Sikkim has the world’s highest-altitude golf venue at 3,970 metres, but the new one in Mustang will be at the altitude of 4,635 metres, according to the planners.
Lomanthang Youth Club and Lomanthang rural municipality will host an event at the venue in Lomanthang from August 27 to mark the opening of the facility.
Four female and 24 male golfers from Kathmandu and Pokhara will participate in the Top of the World Golf Challenge, according to the organisers.

Nepal b-boying scene is going global and here’s the man to lead this journey,"Friday, August 5, 2022","Deepak Lama of Kavrepalanchok is happier and more excited than ever these days. Popularly known as Tony in the Nepal b-boying scene, he thinks he is heralding a new era in the scene in the next few years as he will take it to the global level.
In 2020, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking, more commonly known as b-boying and breakdancing, to the games. It means the b-boying artists will be gracing the Paris 2024 Olympics for the first time in history.
Along with introducing the new sport, the IOC, under the recommendation of the Nepal Olympic Committee, has provided a scholarship to Tony along with nine other sportspeople from Nepal for the next global event.
Under the scholarship, Tony will get financial support of USD 750 per month, advanced training and other facilities, which will help him to enhance and hone his skills so as to ultimately benefit the Nepal b-boying sector.
“The achievement by Tony has made the entire Nepal b-boying community happy and proud,” says Nabin Tamang aka Smiley, Tony’s contemporary in Astroboyz, a b-boying crew based in Kathmandu. “It has also inspired the younger generation.”
The scholarship will be effective from September.
When 23-year-old Tony first heard about the scholarship, he was shocked. He says he could not believe it.
This achievement has equally made Tony’s family happy. He has started getting support from the family although the situation was different in the past eight years since he joined the Nepal b-boying scene.
“They say this is the best thing that ever happened to me,” says Tony.
Tony, who avidly follows American b-boying crew Monster B-Boys, shares his dream of performing in the Olympics. “Now, I will be more focused and prepare myself for the upcoming Olympics.”
There is a reason why he and his family are equally happy. Belonging to a humble family, Lama had been earning for his family so far. Now, with the scholarship, he says, “I don’t have to worry about the side gigs to generate income as the scholarship amount will cover my whole expenses. I have more time to devote to perfecting my head spin, flares, jackhammer, hand hops and others.”
Tony believes that the scholarship will make not only him but the entire Nepal b-boying sector more professional.
As an early teen, Tony used to do gymnastics in an open space near his temporary residence at Ghalate, Bhaktapur. He also played taekwondo and wushu for some time. Later, his brother Biren Tamang told him about b-boying and introduced him to some artists in the Nepal b-boying scene.
The dance form fascinated him. Its power moves, steps, and versatility inspired him. Then, the rest, as they say, is history.
The history of b-boying in Nepal is dated back to the late 2000s when b-boying battles started taking place around the country. But, in the past one and a half decades, it is growing significantly. Some b-boying artists from Nepal have even done many international tours in countries like China, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and others.
“The Nepal b-boying scene of Nepal is thriving remarkably,” says Nishant Gauchan, a first-generation b-boying artist in Nepal. His group, Everest Crew, is the first one to represent Nepal on an international b-boying stage.
According to him, there are many talented artists and crews in Nepal who have even secured different positions in international championships. Tony has also performed in an international festival that was held in Nepal. Likewise, he has also done a Nepal tour.
The b-boying scene has even dispersed outside the valley in places like Dharan, Pokhara, and Chitwan. Similarly, the number of girls is also increasing in the Nepal b-boying scene, according to Tony.
He hopes many other Nepalis will be able to get similar scholarships in the upcoming days. Tony suggests all aspiring b-boys and b-girls should be dedicated and focused.
In Nepali society, skating and b-boying are thought of as something done by drug users. However, Tony now believes that enrolment in the Olympics will form a positive image of b-boying here.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-b-boying-deepak-lama-olympic.html,sports
"Keen to award players, Nepal fails to recognise the need for sports infrastructures and trainers","Wednesday, August 3, 2022","After Nepal’s national cricket team won the ICC World Cricket League Division 4 in 2012 despite not having any promising sports infrastructure, the government of Nepal decided to reward each member of the national team with Rs 200,000. This was the first time the players were receiving any sort of award from the government.
A year later, after Nepal won the ICC World Cricket League Divison Three and qualified for the ICC T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, the government gave players Rs 1 million each. The players, despite not clearing the first group stage of the World Cup, received Rs 500,000 each.
From 2012 to 2014, regular national cricket team members received almost Rs 4 million in rewards. These rewards, according to then vice-captain Gyanendra Malla, played a major role in encouraging the team to do even better.
These rewards not only increased the morale of the players; they also developed a craze for cricket in the country. This is seen as a golden age in Nepali cricket, but the government, rather than take advantage of it and set up a long-term plan for the development of the sport, did nothing as the team have yet to fulfil the potential they showed during the time.
Nepal did get ODI status in 2019, but that was mostly due to the will of the players than the availability of sports infrastructure in the country. It is safe to say that the state of cricket and the infrastructure is the same as it was eight years ago when Nepal played in the T20 World Cup.
This shows that Nepal loves offering awards to those who win medals, but the country puts no effort into creating an environment by investing in sports infrastructure and human resources to groom the athletes who win medals for the country internationally.
Former member secretary of the National Sports Council, Ramesh Kumar Silwal, says that sports in the country will not develop unless the government prioritises sports infrastructure. He believes handing out cash prizes will not develop the scene in the country.
“Those who lead specific sports need to take risks. They need to have good relationships with those in power. I feel the NSC should be able to explain the importance of sports infrastructure to the government,” says Silwal, adding there should be no political prejudice on projects undertaken by previous leaderships.
A good example is the standard operating procedure for prizes and rewards. The Ministry of Youth and Sports has recently amended the procedure and increased the cash prize for those winning a medal internationally.  According to the new procedure, Nepal’s cricket team will be rewarded with a cash prize if they win any of the 13 competitions listed on it. The team will get Rs 3.25 million if they win the cricket world cup.
“Sure, a cash prize is great for the sport. But, that alone won’t help us win. There’s a lot the country needs to do if teams like ours are to win something substantial,” says former cricket captain Gyanendra Malla. “As long as we have a medal over our necks, everything is fine. Once the medal is off, nothing changes.”
Former cricket captain LB Chhetri also agrees with Malla and feels even though these awards give players short-term motivation, the government should focus on sports infrastructure and human resources that make them competent enough to compete in these tournaments.
“People were very happy when the cricket team won different competitions. Post that, we’ve done nothing. We don’t have a set road map to develop it. Nor do we have proper infrastructure or a player development programme. We have nothing,” says Chhetri.
The state of other sports is even worse. Nepali teams have not won anything significant internationally in the past seventy years. Nepal have been taking part in the Asian Games since its first edition in 1951. But, all Nepal have earned so far are 22 bronze and two silver medals.
In the Olympics, it is even worse. All Nepali sportspeople do is participate and they have not won anything. It is so bad that only two players have qualified directly to take part in the Olympic games.
Nepal’s performance in the South Asian Games is just as bad. The South Asian Games is over four decades old. If you leave the tournaments that took place in Nepal in 1999 and 2019, Nepali teams have not done anything worth noting.
Former athletics coach Sushil Narsingh Rana says there needs to be systematic planning and investment for sports infrastructure and human resources if the country wants to do well internationally. He gives the example of Indian Olympian Neeraj Chopra who won India a gold medal in the Olympic games in Japan in the javelin throw event in August 2021.
“The Indian government spent millions on Chopra before he won the country gold,” says Rana.
Contrary to India, Nepal does not spend remotely enough to make athletes ready for tournaments. All the country does is promise to give an athlete a cash prize if s/he does well in tournaments internationally.
The president of Nepal National and International Players Association, Deepak Shrestha, says the government’s mind has never been on improving the tangibles and intangibles to develop the players’ capacity.
“Cash prize increasing is great for morale. But, what these athletes really need before tournaments is good coaching and regular tournaments,” says Shrestha.
Unless that changes, Shrestha feels that the athletes will never be capable enough to win the award set by the government.
“We never talk about what it takes to win, what we need to do to win. Increasing cash prize only seems like a stunt to gain popularity,” says Shrestha, who served as a karate coach in the past.
Former NSC member secretary Yuvaraj Lama also agrees that government bodies have failed to identify athletes who can do well internationally and support them for tournaments abroad. He says the main reason is the presence of political parties in sporting bodies and the lack of knowledge about sports in those who take up leadership roles.
The standard operating procedure for prizes and rewards states that an athlete who wins an Olympic gold medal will win a cash prize of Rs 13 million.
But, Lama feels that unless the country focuses on developing sports infrastructure and players’ capacity, the cash prize can be anything as no one is going to win it anytime soon. It was during Lama’s reign that the procedure to reward players with international medals started. Lama says his successors did nothing to develop the capacity of the players.
During his reign, he even came up with a campaign to develop sports at the grassroots level. With the motto of School to Olympic, his plans were meant to develop Nepali sports.
“The campaign was started to identify young boys and girls at the school level and develop them. We even set up a school association to do this, but we don’t even hear about the association now,” says Lama.
Lama further adds the country needs to invest at the grassroots level to identify athletes and develop them.
“There are athletes as young as 18 who are winning gold medals. But, in Nepal, we only identify players when they reach 25. It is wrong to think that the country will win gold medals by investing in these athletes at that age,” says Lama.
He also feels that not giving enough budget to sports infrastructure and systematic corruption are big barriers to the development of sport in the country. He also thinks that neither politicians nor bureaucrats give enough emphasis to sports.
“They bring some catchy slogans time and again. But, this is just for them to pocket the budgeted amount,” says Lama.
He says these people make a team for a programme, use around Rs 10 million for preparation and pocket the rest. “If you go to the Ministry of Sports and the NSC, you’ll find a truck full of these reports in their store room,” says Lama.
Secretary at the ministry, Damodar Regmi, says the ministry proposed to increase the cash prize to encourage sportspersons.
“We want to compete for medals in events we’ve not won and pave way for us to do even better in events that we have won medals in,” says Regmi. “To do this, we needed a procedure and budget, which after this amendment, we have now.”
Regmi says the new amendment has created a policy provision to stop the cabinet from taking ad-hoc decisions in terms of rewards.
“We have also tried to include overall sports development plans in a policy form,” he says.
There are also plans to provide insurance to the athletes and set up a sports university.  “We’re also planning to build a hospital dedicated to athletes,” says Regmi.
The government often says it does a lot for sports in the country. But in reality, it has not even done the bare minimum. National Sports Council is the country’s only regulatory body when it comes to sports. It plays an important role in developing sports infrastructure, holding competitions and developing coaches.
But, when it comes to developing sports infrastructure, the NSC has done the bare minimum as even today Nepali sports is dependent on infrastructure built during the Panchayat era.
Most of Nepal’s sports infrastructure was built during the time of Sharad Chandra Shah, who was member secretary of the NSC from 1977 to 1988. It was during his era that Dasharath Stadium had a makeshift. It was only after the 2015 earthquake that the stadium was renovated. But, even that took over four years.
Mulpani Cricket Stadium is another example of where the government’s priorities lie. The project to build the stadium started in 2004. But, there has been little to no progress in recent years to complete it.
Narayani Stadium in Brigunj which hosted the 2nd National Games in 1983, Biratnagar’s Shahid Stadium, Dhangadhi’s Dhangadhi Stadium and Janakpur’s Ram-Janaki Stadium are all awaiting a substantial upgrade.
Due to the structural deformity of sports and a lack of return on investment, a new problem has arisen – a shortage of human resources. Because of a lack of investment, players and coaches are going abroad creating a massive hole.
Coaches at the grassroots level of the All Nepal Football Association say they have not even received a salary for the past seven months. An institution like ANFA, which has a budget of Rs 840 million, not being able to pay people to keep them happy is a good example of where Nepal stands currently in terms of sports infrastructure and human resources. Expecting other sports associations, which run with an annual budget of less than a million, to make their coaches and players happy is impossible.
The NSC has over 1,000 permanent positions for its workforce. But, since 2005, it has not been able to hire any permanent staff, and it currently only has 155 administrative staff and 350 technical staff.
When the Minister of Youth and Sports, Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj, assumed office, the ministry was without a secretary for over a month.
After taking the oath of office, Gahatraj said, “This is a ministry where no leaders want to come and no employee is concerned.” This coming from the sports minister is particularly concerning as it shows the sorry state of sports infrastructure in the country.
“Sports is something the government doesn’t care about because if you look at things carefully, the ministry is given to someone as a token for inclusivity,” says Silwal. “Those at the NSC can’t explain things to them because they can’t understand it.”
This year, the government has set aside a budget of Rs 3.25 billion for sports. This is only 0.16 per cent of the total budget for the fiscal year 2022/23. This fund is low because half the budget will be spent as capital expenditure and the remaining on holding competitions for numerous sporting activities.
This is a major cause for concern, say stakeholders.

"Esports receiving Rs 10 million sparked big controversy. But, players say it’s peanuts against the need","Sunday, July 31, 2022","When X (name hidden upon request) found out about the Kathmandu metropolitan city giving a budget of Rs 10 million to develop esports in Nepal, he was not as pleased as many had hoped an esports player would be.
He has been in the scene for nearly a decade and competed in almost all national-level tournaments, but seeing how the media and people blew the thing up disgusted him.
“You, the media, and many others think this budget is a lot. Are you kidding me? Do you think a budget of Rs 1 crore will do anything to develop the esports scene? If you think it will, you’re having a laugh,” says X.
There are multiple esports tournaments taking place in India where the prize pool for one tournament is Rs 10 million. The teams have a coach; they have regular tournaments and a developing scene. But, in Nepal, there is not much and this has led many players like X to quit the scene.
“There’s no future. There’s no investment. People don’t understand what esports is and where it can go if proper attention is given. It’s just frustrating,” says X.
Ever since esports was included as a demonstrative game in the 2018 Asian Games, the scene looks to have improved in Nepal. Teams for games like Dota 2, Counter-Strike: GO, Pub G Mobile and FIFA have gone abroad to take part in international tournaments. While a few have done well, most of them have realised how far back the scene in Nepal is and how much investment is needed to improve the scene in the country if it wants to win it big.
Abhinav Shakya, 21, known as Mel in the esports community, has been playing Dota 2 competitively for the past seven years. Recently, he went to Korea and Israel to take part in the Dota 2 World Championship held by International Esports Federation (IeSF). In Korea (2019), the team did quite well, finishing fifth. But, in Israel (2021), things were not the same as they finished last.
“There is a huge gulf of quality between playing in Nepal and playing with the best in the world,” says Shakya. “Firstly, the level of competition is poor. There are only a few good teams which means it’s very easy to win the national championship.”
But, when they go abroad, the dynamics change. They take on teams who go through a boot camp, have a coach and in some cases even psychologists helping them when they have self-doubts.
“Small things like that play a major role in helping us perform well. Here in Nepal, we don’t even get prize money, which kills our motivation to play,” says Shakya.
The same is the case with FIFA. Sameer Gurung is the country’s national champion. He has been competing internationally regularly but says his time might be coming to an end as he sees no future in the sport.
“I play with my Indian contemporaries. Our matches are always tight. We go neck and neck whenever we play, but that’s where our similarities stop,” says Gurung.
His Indian counterparts take part in tournaments worth over INR 10 million. But, Gurung plays in tournaments that offer the winner as less as Rs 10,000. Even these tournaments have stopped in recent times, which has made players like him frustrated.
“There is no motivation to keep playing. Those that are playing, are doing so only because they are passionate.”
Suraj Dangol, the president of Nepal Esports Association (NESA), understands this. He says, as the governing body, the association trying to create a space for esports in the country. But, due to a lack of support from the government and private sectors, things are not easy.
“We couldn’t offer prize money for the national tournament this year because we didn’t get sponsors. People pledged us an amount, but they didn’t give us anything before the tournament we held recently,” says Dangol.
Vidit Singh, also known as Dafi, is an ex-esports player. After competing in the scene in Nepal, he has decided to shift to coaching. Currently, Singh is in Bangalore coaching a Valorat team and feels that there is a lot Nepal could learn from India.
“India is 10 years ahead of Nepal despite having its own problems. The mindset of parents in India is the same, but others in the country are doing good to support the scene because people have realised how much money there is in esports,” says Singh.
He feels Nepal would have been well ahead of India if the country had had a visionary to take the sector forward.
“A lot of people quit playing games like Counter-Strike and Dota because there was no scope and most grew up and had bigger responsibilities,” says Singh.
He believes that it was time organisations like NESA also focussed on casting these tournaments. A game streamer as well, Singh believes that tournaments like the national championships should be out for everyone to see.
“These generate eyeballs and when there are people watching it, then the sports will automatically come,” says Singh.
Dangol knows this and says the association trying to do this. This year, it tied up with AP1 TV and streamed the tournament live. But, he knows there are shortcomings as they are learning on the job but promises things will be better.
While almost all games are suffering in Nepal, there is one that is thriving – PubG Moblie. There are over 100 teams who take part in every tournament with most Nepali teams dominating South Asia.
One of these teams is High Voltage. The team regularly participate in the PUBG Mobile Pro League (PMPL). What started as a fun activity for most of its players has turned into a full-time profession.
High Voltage are currently at a boot camp in Chabahil preparing for PMPL. The team has six members who are paid a monthly salary. Due to this security, the team can concentrate and perform to their best.
“Things are easy for us, but we don’t take this for granted as we want to win things,” says Diwas Kumar Shrestha.
The boot camp is for them to improve their game and work on their weakness. Shrestha says this helps a lot but believes the scene needs support from the government if it wants to take the next step.
“We need more LAN tournaments. We need more competitions because there is a lot of possibility of this game winning Nepal something big international,” says Shrestha.
But, for Shakya, things are not remotely similar. Dota 2 tournament in Nepal is a rarity and if things continue to be like this, he says he will not play anymore.
“The news about the Kathmandu city investing in esports is positive. I hope things change. If not, I’ll probably stop playing.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/esports-nepal-budget-now-peanuts.html,sports

Why is Pubudu Dassanayake’s second stint as Nepal cricket coach forgettable?,"Thursday, July 21, 2022","When Pubudu Dassanayake was appointed the cricket team’s coach for a second time, there was a lot of optimism. There were valid reasons for the optimism too. During his first stint, Dassanayake had done wonders for the national team. In his three years in charge, he had changed the face of the national team taking them to their maiden T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2014.
But, his second stint did not go as expected. He had two main jobs when appointed for the second time in December 2021 – make the team one again and take Nepal to the T20 World Cup in Australia. Looking back, he failed to do both as he left Nepal with nothing but disappointments.
His appointment came at an unfavourable time. Australian Dav Whatmore quit midway and the national team players were in a contractual dispute with the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN). CAN had removed Gyanendra Malla as captain and Dipendra Singh Airee as vice-captain and even suspended Sompal Kami and Kamal Singh Airee. Sandeep Lamichhane was chosen to lead the team, but many players refused to go to the closed camp.
Pubudu Dassanayake had a tough task on his hand to settle this as the team needed to be one if they wanted to qualify for the T20 World Cup in Australia. But, the team did not do well, crashing out of the semifinal of the T20 Global Qualifiers in Oman.
As time went by, Dassanayake was not able to completely unify the team as the disjointed team has been underperforming massively in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2. Following two disappointing series in the US and Scotland, Dassanayake resigned from his position stating he wanted to be close to his family living in Canada.
“This was one of the hardest coaching stints in my career,” an emotional Dassakayake said on Wednesday. “I’m resigning because of personal reasons. If I don’t do this, I’ll regret it later in life.”
But, a few hours following his resignation, he was appointed the coach of the Canadian cricket team.
During his term, Nepal played 14 ODIs and 13 T2Os and won 4 ODIs and 10 T20s. He led the team to victory in the Tri-Series against Papua New Guinea(PNG) and Malaysia. But, the team did not perform well in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2. Out of the 12 games, Nepal managed to win only four as they languished seventh in the table, only above PNG losing seven games in the three series.
There were a few games that Nepal lost although they should have won. There is a general feeling that Nepal lost two games they should have won against the UAE. The same goes for the games they lost against the USA and Oman in Texas. Recently, Nepal were in a commanding position but lost both games against Namibia due to poor batting.
Nepal’s batting looked particularly weak during Pubudu Dassanayake’s reign. Prior to his appointment, the team’s batting was aggressive, but that soon turned defensive as players, especially the openers, did not look comfortable under pressure.
A good example is a game against the UAE in Oman during the T20 Global Qualifiers. Nepal were unbeaten in the tournament when they faced the UAE in the semifinal. Chasing 176, Nepal crumbled under pressure as they lost by 68 runs.
In March, Nepal beat PNG in both the games held in the UAE. But, when the two teams faced each other in Nepal, the hosts lost both games. Again, the team did beat PNG and Malaysia in the T20 series in Nepal, which goes to show the team did fairly well in the T20s compared to ODIs under Pubudu Dassanayake.
The team that Pubudu Dassanayake was looking after was relatively young as the average age of the squad was around 23. This is why the team have not been able to perform, says Dassanayake.
“The team lacks experience. They are very young. The captain is only 21 so the future is bright for this team,” says Dassanayake.
He says that the two games they lost in the US were due to a lack of experience within the squad.
“Scotland was a different story. The conditions there were different and we couldn’t take advantage of it,” he says.
But, Pubudu Dassanayake does say that Nepal had what it takes to become the best associate cricket team in the next year.
“The boys have what it takes,” he says.

Nepal women’s football team are always neglected. Will they do wonder in SAFF Women’s Championship 2022?,"Thursday, July 21, 2022","Nepal is hosting the SAFF Women’s Championship for the second consecutive time. There is a lot of hope that Nepal could win the tournament as Nepal women’s football team have become the runner-up four times. But, if you look at recent developments, there is little to no chance that Nepal will be able to do so.
The championship will start on September 6, but preparations for the tournament have not begun as far as Nepal women’s football team are concerned. While the city to host the tournament has not been decided yet, the hosts’ team do not have a coach, so they have not been called for closed camp.
All Nepal Football Association prioritising men’s football over women’s football is an age-old affair. The only time ANFA looks towards the women’s team is when they take part in specific tournaments. The situation is such that they do not even have a permanent coach as they get a new one every tournament.
“We are disregarded,” says a women’s national team member. “The men’s team train regularly before a tournament, but we don’t get to do that. We don’t even know who will coach us. How can we do well when this is happening?”
As the women’s football team were taking part in the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou for the first time, the responsibility to coach the team was given to Bal Gopal Maharjan. He had been training the team for a month. It is likely that he will be given the task to coach the team in the SAFF Championships too, but things are not sure as training stopped after the Asian Games were postponed.
The last time Nepal women’s football team played a match was in September 2021. They took on Bangladesh and won one and drew another. Things are worse if you look at things from 2014 onwards. Since then, Nepal have only played friendly matches with two teams, Malaysia and Bangladesh. That is a major concern as the team members believe they should have played better teams so that they could prepare for the SAFF Women’s Championship.
“We need to have a long-term plan in place to improve the team,” says ANFA’s women’s department chief Hari Khadka. “We need to give them better training and exposure only then will they be able to do well.”
Nepal once again will have to go through India if they want to win it all. In all the five editions of the SAFF Women’s Championship, India have been Nepal’s biggest nemesis. Nepal women’s football team have lost to them four times in the final and once in the semi-final. But, this year, Bangladesh will also pose a threat to Nepal.
Anjila Tumbapo Subba, the team’s goalkeeper, tells Onlinekhabar that since the closed camp had not started, the player’s psyche had been affected. Most of them felt they would once again end up on the losing end, especially against India.
“We always lose against India because we don’t get enough time for preparation,” says Subba.
Former women’s team coach Khadka agrees that preparations are not enough. He feels the team need to play a lot more games to compete with the likes of India.
“We shouldn’t have stopped the training camp that was taking place for the Asian Games,” says Khadka, adding that he has asked ANFA to start training as soon as possible.
Nepal women’s football team are unbeaten against all the participants in the SAFF Women’s Championship apart from India. India are the powerhouse when it comes to women’s football in South Asia as they have won all five editions.
India continue to improve their team while Nepal have done nothing as such.
“India train for the entire year while we train when the tournament is around the corner. This is a major difference as they regularly play friendly matches while we don’t,” says Subba. “We won’t improve if we don’t train and play matches.”
Nepal women’s football team’s aim in every tournament is to beat India. If they beat India, it is almost certain that they will win the championship. But, looking at the preparations, it is highly unlikely that it will happen this year.
“Sure, having a goal and determination to beat India is good but that’ll not get us anywhere,” says Nepal’s goal machine Sabitra Bhandari. “We need proper coaching and regular training. Unless that happens, we’ll get nowhere.”
Bhandari feels that a major reason Nepal women’s football team have not been able to get better is not having a permanent coach. This means they do not even have regular training. Since coaches are appointed based on tournaments, players often are stuck in a dilemma on whose coaching methods they need to take under consideration.
Since Gary Phillips left in 2021, the team did not have a coach. Recently, Bal Gopal Maharjan, who did well for the men’s team as the head coach, was appointed the head coach for the Asian Games. But, he says he does not know if he will be given the responsibility to coach Nepal in the SAFF Women’s Championship.
“They gave me the responsibility to take the team to the Asian Games. I don’t know if I’ll be given the role to coach the team in the SAFF Championship,” says Maharjan.
It is likely that the decision will be made at ANFA’s executive committee meeting on Thursday.
The women’s football team have been neglected for years. It is not just about international competitions. What disappoints players is the lack of domestic competitions too. Compared to men, women hardly take part in any competition.
ANFA did host another edition of the National Women’s League, but it failed to hold the second round of the league, which it said it would host in May. This will also be talked about at ANFA’s next executive meeting.
In a bid to improve women’s football, ANFA is planning to build an academy in Rautahat. But, due to legal disputes, its process is yet to start. New ANFA President Pankaj Bikram Nembang has said he will build on it during his term.
But, will he keep his promise?

Nepal cricket coach Pubudu Dassanayake resigns,"Wednesday, July 20, 2022","Kathmandu, July 20
Nepal cricket coach Pubudu Dassanayake has resigned.
In the resignation submitted to the cricket-governing body, Dassanayake says he is leaving the team due to personal reasons.
He emailed the resignation before the team were in Scotland for a tri-series with Scotland and Namibia under the ICC World Cup League Two. He also announced his decision to leave by organising a press conference in Kathmandu today.
As the team could not perform well, Dassanayake was under pressure.
CAN had appointed him to the position for the second stint in December 2021, by signing a two-year contract.
“It was the toughest decision that I have to take in my coaching career. I love Nepal cricket and I am very emotional to leave at this stage,” CAN quotes Pubudu Dassanayake in a Facebook post, “Reason for my departure is to take care of my family when they need me the most. I will regret it if I cannot do my part for my family at this time. I wish the Nepal team the best.”
Pubudu Dassanayake was the coach of the team from 2011 to 2015 also. During Dassanayake’s term as the coach, the Nepal cricket team achieved some considerable feats and senior players of the current national team frequently remember him.
However, the team could not make any impression during his second term.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-cricket-pubudu-dassanayake-quit.html,sports
CAN announces four Nepal T20 League teams,"Monday, July 18, 2022","Kathmandu, July 18
The Cricket Association of Nepal has announced the names of four of the six teams that will take part in the first edition of the Nepal T20 League.
The four teams are Kantipur Capitals, Biratnagar Super Kings, Janakpur Royals and Lumbini All Stars. Two more teams will be confirmed soon, informs CAN General Manager Prashant Malla.
CAN, in May, had announced that six teams would take part in the T20 league and issued a call for tenders to own teams based in Biratnagar, Janakpur, Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Sudurpaschim.
Nepal T20 League will be Nepal’s first official T20 being held by CAN. The International Cricket Council has already given permission to hold the event.
CAN hopes Nepal T20 League will help change the face of cricket in the country. The tournament is expected to start on September 24.
Operators of Everest Premier League, however, have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court against CAN asking the apex court for an interim stay order to stop CAN from going ahead with its plan to start its own T20 league.
The teams are mostly owned by Nepalis, but Lumbini All Stars and Janakpur Royals are owned by people in the US and India respectively.
“It’s normal for foreigners to invest in leagues. We’ve seen that in football and in the Indian Premier League too. The ICC also doesn’t stop us from doing so,” says Malla. “We want to involve people who have the intentions to develop Nepali cricket.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-t20-league-teams.html,sports
Nepal U-20 footballers are fresh but prudently picked. Will they live up to the expectation?,"Monday, July 18, 2022","On July 11, the football ground of Dasrath Stadium was occupied with faces that were new in the Nepali football fraternity. Many of them had entered the Dasharath Stadium, Nepal’s only international football venue, for the first time. But, they were more excited than nervous. They were jumping, diving and kicking the balls.
Those new faces were members of Nepal’s newly formed U-20 football team preparing for two international competitions—SAF U-20 Championship scheduled to be held from July 25 to August 5 and AFC U-20 Asia Cup Qualifiers to be held from September 10 to 18.
While the football-governing body, All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) has been training 30 players, 23 will be selected for the U-20 football final squad. These 30 players were also very carefully selected from around 700 applicants.
It means ANFA has invested a lot of time and energy to form the new U-20 football team as it has a lot of expectations. So, will they live up to the expectations?
Previously, the U-19 and U-20 football players used to be selected from the Lalit Memorial U-18 Championship, in which the age-group players of A division clubs would play.
But, this time, due to the Covid pandemic, the event could not take place. Hence, the All Nepal Football Association, the football governing body, was compelled to select the players from an open competition.  Subsequently, many new faces got a place in the Nepal U-20 football team.
Likewise, the U-20 football team coach Megh Raj KC is also confident about the players selected among 700 applicants. KC believes that the open selection has not only changed the pattern of selecting players but it has also provided an equal opportunity to all talented footballers.
Among the 30 being trained, only seven players including Ayush Ghalan have played representing Nepal earlier. Ghalan has even played for the senior national team also.
“But, all the players are equally talented; there is a good team combination among all of us,” says Ghalan. “For now, our major target is to win SAF and qualify for AFC U-20 Asia Cup.”
Ghalan, who had never been to the age group so far, believes his experience in the senior national team will also remarkably help in the upcoming international championships. He is confident about the performance of his teammates.
The enthusiasm people showed during the selection process made coach KC realise that the culture of football is growing rapidly in Nepal. He says the open selection has made a lot of footballers believe that if they have potential, they can even play for the nation. Footballers who are from diverse backgrounds and places have participated in the U-20 football team selection process.
Earlier, KC was not much confident about the reliability of the open selection. But now, he is optimistic about the team. “I cannot assure whether the team will succeed or not, but they will perform outstandingly,” says KC.
There are some reasons why KC believes so. Currently, the Nepali football followers consider Ghalan as one of the most talented players in the team due to the experience he has received in the last couple of years. Further, KC says everyone is as talented as him.
“Definitely, Ghalan has performed well for Nepal in a short span. He has been a role model for many and proved himself as well but for me, everyone in the team is like Ghalan,” he says. “But, after watching them play, you will also get the same feelings as mine regarding other players. Hopefully, some of them will even be promoted to the senior level national team.”
“Everyone is working hard, we are optimistic about the match result,” he adds.
While KC is optimistic about the newly formed U-20 football team, he also has challenges. The team have not been able to evaluate the performance of the opponent teams. KC says the players have not got a chance to look at the performance of the opponent teams because similar to Nepal, the opponent countries too have not organised age-based football matches.
It means the U-20 football teams are preparing for the tournament without knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the opponents.
Nonetheless, KC says the national team have already identified their strength. “Overall, all our sides are strong. The team have a strong fighting spirit. The best thing about our players is the teamwork,” says KC.
So, will the young men make their coach happy? Only time does have the answer.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-u-20-footballers-expectations.html,sports
International medalist takes part in the grassroots-level event of President Running Shield,"Thursday, July 14, 2022","Kathmandu, July 14
There has been controversy in the President Running Shield as an athlete who won an international medal has taken part in the tournament.
According to the tournament directives, an athlete who has won such a medal is not allowed to take part in these competitions held at the grassroots.
Badal Karki, who won a bronze medal in SAFF Cross Country Championship in Nagaland in India, ran the 3,000-metre event coming in second. Karki also took part in the 4 x 400-metre relay in the Gandaki province.
The President Running Shield directives also state that if such an athlete is found to have competed in the event, he/she would be disqualified and his/her medal would be taken back and handed to the person with the next best time. Action will also be taken against the people who allowed this to happen, the directive states.
Nepal Sports Council‘s tournament planning department’s Min Sharma says the council will take strict action against the athlete and those who allowed him to participate in the competition.
But, the Gandaki province’s athletics coach Gaj Bahadur Gurung has denied any wrongdoing. He has said his team has not included ineligible athletes.
He defended Karki by stating the tournament he took part in was not a track and field event either.
“That was a competition that didn’t fall under athletics. That is why we included him in the President Running Shield,” says Gurung.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/int-medalist-president-running-shield.html,sports
"Skateboarding has a great potential for Nepal sports. But, infrastructure crisis has hit it hard","Wednesday, July 13, 2022","Pemba Shrestha became champion of the fifth edition of the National Skateboard Championship, in the women’s category, held on June 20 and 21 in Annapurna Skate Park in Pokhara.
But, it was not easy for her to win the championship. Things were tough for her not because she had to compete against skilled competitors but because she practised on a cemented basketball court. Although she prepared strictly for the championship, she went through various hurdles. The toughest hurdle for her was the competition ground, the standard skateboard park.
This may sound strange, but the national champion had a hard time performing in the professional skateboard park. Stakeholders say this is a very disappointing scenario for every skater in Nepal.
A native of Kathmandu, Shrestha entirely practised in a cemented basketball court of Tribhuvan University for the national championship. The space where she practised and the space she competed for the national championship had totally different structures. This created trouble for her, but somehow she managed to win the championship.
“For the entire time, I practised on the cemented basketball court, but the skateboard park in Pokhara has a completely different structure. I felt nervous and it was tough during the championship,” says Shrestha.
The sad reality is that the capital of the country does not have one standard skateboard park, which is why Shrestha was compelled to practise on a basketball court. There were many other Kathmandu-based skaters like Shrestha who go through a similar hassle.
Despite these challenges, the sport is also dispersing outside the valley. This year, skaters from 25 districts of Nepal participated in the national championship. In the first national championship held in 2016, there were only 50 participants. This year, the number increased to 150.
Currently, there are 973 registered skaters in Nepal. This means the competition is thriving. But, the question is: how can one manage to compete in the championship without training in the appropriate park?
Ujjwal Dangol, a first-generation skater and national skate coach, also agrees that skaters in Nepal are progressing immensely. But, the primary thing that is obstructing their growth is the lack of infrastructure.
Earlier, Dangol used to own a private skating park in Kathmandu and thanks to his park, one has seen a number of skaters in Kathmandu. But, he was compelled to shut it down amid the Covid crisis.
“The skaters in Nepal have great potential. They can even bag the biggest international title if proper facilities are provided to them,” says Dangol.
Dangol is right. So far, Nepali skaters have already reached various global platforms. Some of them have even won championships. Similarly, Nepal has regularly shown its participation in Asian Plate Championship since 2016.
In 2019, 19-year-old Shrestha went to China for an event and the skateboard park she saw there fascinated her. “I dream of skateboarding in such a park here as well,” says Shrestha.
Currently, Nepal has altogether four skateboard parks: Jhapa, Dharan, Pokhara and Rupandehi. According to Nepal Skating and Skateboarding Association, one such park will be added in Kathmandu. The main issue for the association is the nominal budget allocated by the National Sports Council for the sector.
Skating is garnering remarkable recognition worldwide. In 2020, it made its debut in Summer Olympics. And, it has also been included in Asian Games 2023 under roller sports. This has sparked hope among many enthusiasts like Shrestha and Dangol in Nepal also.
Shrestha also aims to compete in the Olympics.
“While it has been earning exceptional popularity globally, the people here in power still haven’t understood its importance,” says Achyut Khanal, the president of Nepal Skating and Skateboarding Association. “Many of them still reckon skateboarding as something that is only played by drug users (tyapes).”
That is why, the association is dependent on international aid for its operation, Khanal informs. Yet, this time, the association has a plan to increase the number of events and parks.
“To increase the number of skateboard parks, we will coordinate with each municipality with a motto ‘One municipality, one skatepark,” says Khanal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/skateboard-nepal-lacks-infrastructure.html,sports

Is the game over for Gyanendra Malla and Sharad Vesawkar in Nepali cricket?,"Thursday, July 7, 2022","Gyanendra Malla and Sharad Vesawkar were a part of the golden age of Nepali cricket that began in 2011. As of late, Malla, known as a technically sound batsman and Vesawkar, considered The Finisher by the audience, have not been able to show their performance representing the national team.
Since February and March, Vesawkar and Malla respectively have not played for the national team. The Nepali cricket team have already played four series without these two senior players. Currently, the Nepali team are entirely dependent upon their young players.
So, what does this mean?
Vesawkar was removed from the Nepali cricket team due to continuous injury and weak performance. Malla does not have an injury problem. These two cricketers have not resigned from the team officially. But, they have remained out of the national team.
Does it mean the end of their cricketing career?
“The national team haven’t closed the doors for any of its senior players. There is always an avenue for the players who can prove themselves,” says Dipendra Chaudhary, the chief selector of the national team.
But, currently, the team management is giving an opportunity to new players. Anyone who performs well can get into the team, he adds.
At present, the Nepali cricketers are in Canada preparing for ICC Cricket World Cup League two to play against Scotland and Namibia in the tri-nation series. Nepal are playing one practice and two ODI matches against Canada. Afterwards, the team will vie against Scotland.
The Nepali national team led by 21-year-old leg spinner, Sandeep Lamichhane, mostly include young players. Coach Pubudu Dassanayake since his appointment in December last year has been giving priority to young players.
Hence, it is tough for the senior players to get included in the Nepali cricket team. Wicketkeeper Binod Bhandari is the only senior player among the 14 members touring Canada. He made his national debut in 2009 during the ACC T20 tournament.
Lately, the presence of Vesawkar in the Nepali cricket team is rare.
After performing in the Everest Premier League of 2021, he made a comeback to the national team.  Vesawkar was confident about his form before going to Oman to play. But, he could not play in World Cup qualifiers due to his injury.
While Vesawkar remained distant from the team due to his injury and weak performance, Malla went through some different situations.
Malla was removed from the captaincy by the Cricket Association of Nepal after he spoke against the governing body over the central contract of the cricketers and the facilities provided to them.
Yet, after that, he played T-20 World Cup qualifiers in Oman and League two in UAE, under the captainship of Lamichhane. But, then, he has not been selected for the Nepali cricket team. Many believe that it is due to his confrontation with CAN.
Since last March after playing against the UAE, Nepali cricketers have played three unofficial and two official series. However, Malla has not been able to return to the team. After League Two, CAN removed Malla and Binod Bhandari from the team and announced a team with young players.
At that time, the chief selector of the national team had said, “The veteran players are given respite, and once they start doing well, they can rejoin the team.”
This very strategy by the chief selector was implemented for Bhandari and he is in the team. However, things turned different for Malla.
The last time Malla played for Nepal was during League Two in the UAE against the host country. In that match, he scored 30 runs. In the last match of the same series against Papua New Guinea, Malla was on the bench.
According to selector Chaudhary, Malla is still a very significant player in the Nepali cricket team. Likewise, the team management has already talked with Vesawkar and Basanta Regmi. However, for the selection of the team, one has to be at the camp for training.
According to the team management, lately, the injured Vesawkar is busy with family affairs. CAN even tried to reach out to Regmi and Prithu Baskota. But, both of them are currently in the United States.
Last time, Vesawkar played for Nepal on February 14 against Ireland in the four-nation T20 series in Oman. Since September 2021, he is not in the team.
“One must go to the camp for selection in the national team. Those who do not show up are not eligible for selection. However, all the senior players are welcome in the team,” says Chaudhary.
Malla, meanwhile, has started providing training at a cricket academy jointly established by himself, Paras Khadka and other players. These days, he is busy teaching others rather than his own training.
Dev Khanal, the captain of the under-19 Nepali cricket team, has substituted Malla’s position and is performing well. The one who performs well in that position is included in the team, says Chaudhary.
All-rounder Aadil Ansari, who joined the senior team together with Khanal from under-19, has already proved himself. Likewise, another young all-rounder Wasir Ahmed is also included in the Nepali cricket team and has gone on the Canada tour.
“Except for a few positions, there are alternative players,” says Chaudhary.
Until recently, Malla had a record to score the highest run for the national team. But, Rohit Kumar Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee have beaten Malla’s record during his absence.
Paudel has scored a total of 747 runs in ODI that include one century and five half-centuries. Malla, on the other hand, has scored 480 runs in 19 matches. Aarif Sheikh, Aashif Sheikh, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee are also close to Malla.
Airee has scored 1,033 runs in T20 internationals. In 39 matches, he scored one century and four half-centuries.

"For a want of regular competitions, Nepali athletes fear their skills wearing off","Monday, July 4, 2022","Nepali athlete Rohit Chaudhary of Tribhuvan Army Club has been playing javelin for the last seven years. During this time, he has played in one international and three national competitions.
But since the 13th South Asian Games (SAG) in 2019, he’s only taken part in one competition – the 44th National Athletics Competition and he feels that due to lack of regular events, he doesn’t feel like an athlete anymore. He’s not alone in this, many Nepali athletes share the same feelings.
“Competitions in other sports like football and cricket are being organised regularly. But, why is the condition of athletics so stagnant?” questions Chaudhary, after the 44th National Athletics Championship organised by the Nepal Athletics Association on June 26. “What is the meaning of the sports if the competitions are not organised ?”
The 28-year-old has been associated with javelin throw since his school days. He started playing with a bamboo-made javelin. After joining Nepal Army in 2015, the Nepali athlete began playing it professionally representing Nepal Army. In his debut, during the seventh National Games in 2016, he bagged the gold medal.
“Doctors will not recognise themselves as doctors if they do not practise. Similarly, if pilots do not fly planes for a couple of years, they will not remember themselves as pilots,” he says, adding, “Not having any competitions to take part in these three years, I couldn’t feel I was a player.”
Known as the king of sports, athletics is a foundation for every sport. There are two main categories of athletics — track and field. The track features running while the field includes two sub-categories: jump and throw. While the long-distance race in the track category is taking place frequently, the competition in the field category is held rarely for Nepali athletes.
“It seems everyone neglects our field events. We can show our game only during national championships and national games organised by the association,” says Chaudhary. “Such situations do not just give us pain but depression too. The competitions do not occur even if we prepare ourselves consistently. The motivation wanes if we do not get a place to prove ourselves. I would have already stopped playing if I had not been associated with the army.”
Last year in the Olympics held in Japan, Neeraj Chopra of India won a historical gold medal for India in the javelin throw. While Chopra bagged gold by throwing 87 metres, Chaudhary created his personal best record by throwing 61.60 metres during the national competition on Sunday. The players of the Indian sub-continent have similar body structures as Nepali athletes, yet Nepal is far behind in the competition.
According to Chaudhary, to achieve success in the international arena, Nepal has to invest and give priority to the players. He says, “I thought why we couldn’t be there as I watched Chopra win the gold at the Olympics the previous year. However, there is a significant distinction between the players here and there. We haven’t been able to practise with a real javelin and our training hasn’t been consistent. Additionally, a single international standard javelin costs Rs 250,000, which is too expensive for us.”
Chandra Kala Lamagade, a national record holder of shot put, plays for Nepal Police. She stopped playing after her pregnancy and lives in Jhapa with her daughter. After hearing about the national competition, she asked for leave from the sports club of Nepal Police and came to Kathmandu to participate in it.
Moreover, to her surprise, she won gold in shot put and javelin throw during the 44th National Athletics Championship and saved Nepal Police from becoming medal-less. However, the Nepali athlete is disappointed to see the passive scene of the field events.
“Our events are not like others as the number of competitions is very low. Things could have been better if the competitions had taken place regularly. Participating in regular competitions and training helps us to perform well at an international level,” says Lamgade.
This Nepali athlete’s victory in shot put and javelin without training for the last three years and her status as a new mother exposed the real competitive level of Nepali women in shot put and javelin throw.
“I have been playing for the last 11 years. Until now, in any event, I haven’t seen my competitors.  My performance would have been enhanced if there were competitors of my level,” she says. “After pregnancy, I performed my duty from Jhapa. I had not thought of winning. I just came for an experience because staying in a distant place for a long time can create more problems in performance.”
Jaya Rani Tharu who won four gold medals and one silver medal out of five categories during her debut in a national competition is also worried about being unable to test her quality.
The 21-year-old Nepali athlete entered in Tribhuvan Army Club from the player’s quota in 2018. Since then, she got her first opportunity to play and became a national record holder in athletics. Tharu is known as a Nepali athlete with great potential.
“The competitions in our categories of athletics never take place. The importance of regular training decreases if the competitions are not held. If such competitions take place at least a year, players can improve their performance,” she says.
RK Bista, the secretary of the Nepal Athletics Association, admits the number of competitions and Nepali athletes in field events decreased while giving priority to track events.
“The Athletics Association hasn’t missed these events in the national competition. But, the other organisations and private sectors are only focused on the track events,” says Bista. He adds, “In the production of players, we are failing. Trainers are focused on conducting training only for successful players, and they don’t pay attention to producing players.”
He demands appointing the trainers from the concerned sports association rather than from the National Sports Council (NSC). But, the new Sports Act has the provision to appoint trainers under NSC.
Bista is despondent about NSC’s decision to provide only five spots for the athletics in upcoming Asian Games. The event itself contains about 40 athletics competitions, but the NSC has decided that only five Nepali athletes–three men and two women–will compete.
“It feels we are even mistreated by the regulatory body. The quota has been given only to the sports having the potential to perform well,” says Bista.
Globally, the attraction to solo games is less than the attraction to team games. The condition of those games is at high risk in a country where they have not been prioritised. In Nepal also, athletics has not been the priority of the concerned body and Nepali athletes demand a change in the situation.

ACC Women’s T20 Championship: Nepal crash out of the semifinal in heartbreaking fashion as rain washes out game,"Friday, June 24, 2022","Kathmandu, June 24
Nepal crashed out of the semifinal of the ACC Women’s T20 Championship 2022 after rain intervened during the second innings of their match against the UAE at the Kinrara Oval in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
Winning the toss, Nepal put the UAE to bat first. As a place in the Asia Cup was on the line, Nepal started the match with a lot of intent and bowled very well.
Ashmina Karmacharya impressed with the ball picking up five wickets as Nepal dismissed a strong UAE team for only 81 runs. Indu Barma and Sita Rana Magar picked up three and two wickets respectively to give Nepal a great chance at reaching the final and qualifying.
But, that was it. Before Nepal could come out to bat, rain disrupted and the match was called off.

Nepal drop down 8 places in FIFA ranking,"Friday, June 24, 2022","Kathmandu, June 24
Nepal have dropped down in the FIFA ranking by eight places.
In the recently updated FIFA ranking, Nepal are ranked 176 in the world. The football team’s ranking in March was 168.
This comes after Nepal lost all its games in the recently concluded Asian Cup Qualifiers in Kuwait. Nepal lost 2-0 to Jordan, 4-1 to Kuwait and 7-0 to Indonesia. These three losses seem to have had a direct effect on the FIFA ranking.
Nepal dropping down eight places in the ranking is the worst since 2014 when it dropped down 17 places.

ANFA recalls disgruntled players back to the national team,"Thursday, June 23, 2022","Kathmandu, June 23
All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Wednesday decided to recall all 10 national football team players who had left the team after a tussle with head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
The decision was taken by the recently elected executive committee of ANFA. The newly appointed president of ANFA, Pankaj Bikram Nembang had said he would decide on the future of the players and coach immediately.
Rohit Chand, Anjan Bista, Bimal Gharti Magar, Ananta Tamang, Bishal Rai, Bishal Shrestha, Sujal Shrestha, Tej Tamang, Dinesh Rajbanshi and Suman Lama had left the hotel they were being kept after arguments with coach Al Mutairi.
The executive meeting also held discussions about the future of Al Mutairi. An ANFA panel that investigated the case had asked ANFA to find an alternative to the coach. The new executive committee has started the process, but it is not as simple as the committee needs to ensure that Nepal’s relationship with countries that support Nepali football does not deteriorate.
Al Mutairi was sent by the Qatar Football Association under a grant to coach the Nepal national football team.
Newly appointed general secretary Kiran Rai has been tasked with the responsibility to talk to all parties to solve the issue as calmly as possible.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/anfa-recalls-players-team.html,sports

What Pankaj Bikram Nembang’s rise means for Nepali football,"Wednesday, June 22, 2022","Four years ago, two people–Karma Tsering Sherpa and Pankaj Bikram Nembang–wanting to change the face of the All Nepal Football Association became its president and senior vice president respectively.
They were friends with similar visions to develop the Nepali football scenario. However, less than a year after getting elected, differences started to arise. And, in the recent election for the position of the president of ANFA, the two locked horns for the same in which Pankaj Bikram Nembang beat his long-time friend, and now rival, by six votes.
Many believe this is because of how well Nembang planned the election. As soon as he started having differences with Sherpa, over three years ago, he decided he would be going to contest the next election.
For that, he started to get the major executive committee members on board. He got people like Dawa Lama, Bir Bahadur Khadka and Kiran Rai on board with him and he, like before, pressed the motto of ‘Change ANFA’ and publicised it among all the voters.
Pankaj Bikram Nembang’s agenda of financial transparency, collective decision making, decentralisation, power-sharing, accountability, efficient secretariat, promotion of the national team, grassroots and youth programmes, and equal priority for women’s and men’s football also helped his cause.
He also has the support of the majority in the executive committee for the next four years as he is leading the organisation that uses an annual budget of about Rs 1 billion. But, he also faces the challenge of not becoming a target of different interest groups as well as balancing foreign relations with members of the Asian Football Confederation and FIFA.
ANFA on Monday elected 13 other members to its executive committee. Two more positions are yet to be filled as there was a tie between four people. When that resolves, most of the members of the executive committee will be new faces.
This is probably the first time in the history of ANFA that almost all the members are new to their posts except Bir Bahadur Khada, Dawa Lama and Dirgha Bahadur KC, who were servicing in the same posts as the last term.
When Sherpa became ANFA president, he faced the tough task of dividing responsibilities among his team members and he had a lot of them. In a bid to defeat Ganesh Thapa, he even had people from Thapa’s team on his side instead of his own team members. This had left a bad taste in the mouth of his team members.
This year, Pankaj Bikram Nembang will not have to face this problem. But that said, it is not going to be easy.
According to the ANFA constitution, the president has to appoint a general secretary and a treasurer. There is speculation that Kiran Rai will be the general secretary. Rai, last term, was an executive committee member and spokesperson of ANFA. Sources also say that Rabindra Man Joshi will be reappointed as the treasurer.
But, Pankaj Bikram Nembang also needs to see where he can fit Krishna Thapa, who helped him a lot during the elections. He will also have to find a place for former national team captains like Upendra Man Singh, Hari Khadka, Bal Gopal Maharjan and Rakesh Shrestha, who are revered by a lot of people.
One of the happiest men following the ANFA election is former president Ganesh Thapa. Thapa was suspended by FIFA in 2015 with the charges of financial irregularities. But, he has not been away from the scene. Recently, he held a press conference accusing Sherpa of corruption.
There were even rumours Thapa was helping Nembang because people close to Thapa supported Nembang in the election. But Nembang disagrees.
However, the way people close to Thapa celebrated Nembang’s victory at Park Village Resort in Budanilkantha is quite evident that they wanted him to win. Both Thapa’s sons, Abhishek and Gaurav, also attended the event.
Will Thapa have a say in how ANFA is run? Only time will tell.
Pankaj Bikram Nembang says the new executive committee will continue projects carried out by the old executive committee. He says he wants to finish building the women’s academy in Rautahat. His major agenda is also to restart the national league.
Pankaj Bikram Nembang also wants to ensure that the construction of the ANFA Excellence Centre in Kaski goes ahead smoothly. The proposed excellence centre will have three full-size pitches, two astroturf fields, two futsal grouds and two beach football fields. ANFA also plans to construct buildings that house up to 120 players and officials as well as a gym, a swimming pool and a rehabilitation centre for players. This project will be undertaken with support from FIFA and Nebmang will have to lead it as ANFA has planned to build it by 2024. But, it will be challenging.
Another challenge will be restarting the national league. Sherpa tried it but failed, citing a lack of budget. If Nembang can start the National League or not will be interesting to see.
Along with that Pankaj Bikram Nembang will also have to solve the dispute among A Division clubs and the Nepal Super League who are at odds over players’ rights.
But, before that, his immediate role will be to solve the issues surrounding the national team. Sherpa was criticised for not being able to solve the issue regarding 10 senior players leaving the camp. He was accused of siding with national team head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
An ANFA panel has suggested that ANFA find an alternative to Al Mutairi. But, this is not going to be as easy for Pankaj Bikram Nembang as he does not have a good relationship with Al Mutairi, who was re-hired by Nepal thanks to the support from Qatar FA and has a contract with ANFA until 2024.
It is going to be interesting to see where this goes.

Jeevan Lama: Resilience is establishing once-failed man among Nepal’s top trail runners,"Wednesday, June 22, 2022","Jeevan Lama was distraught when he was not able to complete the Annapurna 100 trail race. After running for around 60 kilometres, he quit as the sole in his shoe tore down. Tired and frustrated, he knew he could not carry on going forward.
The next morning when he saw everyone with a finisher’s medal, it hurt him even more. He was disappointed in himself and promised himself that the next time, he would do better.
To prepare for the race, Jeevan Lama trained every day. He wanted to prove to himself that his decision to quit everything and focus on trail running was not a wrong decision. He focused on diet. He ate well. He slept well and there came the race day, he did what he could not do a year before and finished the 100-kilometre race.
“It was a happy moment. Finishing that race gave me the confidence that I could do this professionally and that my decision to leave behind everything was the right one. But, this is just the beginning because I have a long way to go,” says the 33-year-old.
Recently, Jeevan Lama won gold in the 100-mile Manjushree Trail Race and is now preparing for the biggest race of his career. He and trail runner Rashila Tamang, are preparing to go race the Val D’Aran by UTMB. With this, he hopes that the sport gets more attention in the country and wishes that athletes like him and Tamang do not have to face problems due to the lack of sponsorships in the future.
“It’s hard for a Nepali athlete to think about going to these races. I’m glad people are helping us, but if we want to really compete, we need sponsors who will support us throughout our journey,” says Lama.
For Jeevan Lama, it all started in 2018 when he quit his job in Dubai to return to Nepal. He had left Nepal to work abroad to escape drug addiction in 2012 when he went to Oman. After two years, he returned to Nepal where he got into the same circle again and fearing he would get back into drugs, he decided to leave for the UAE.
“Work was okay, but after a few years, it felt monotonous. There was no growth in what I was doing and was contemplating returning. Things also changed when my father died in 2018,” says Lama.
Lama was not able to come to Nepal on time to perform the final rites of his father. He did manage to come, but by them, most of the rituals had been performed by his family members. He was sad. Emotions were running high. And to escape the frustration, he ran.
“Running had always helped me escape things. Whenever I was frustrated, I always ran. And as I was interested in the outdoors, whenever I came to Nepal during holidays, I ran around,” says Lama.
As Jeevan Lama did not know much about the scene, he started exploring. He ran trails and ran with anyone who was interested. He had come to Nepal to get into the outdoor scene and even obtained a trekking guide licence, but he never got there as he ran around whenever he got a chance.
“In 2018, I ran in the 60-kilometre Sindhupalchok International Trail Race. That gave me the confidence that I could do this,” he says.
But, Jeevan Lama performance in the 2018 Annapurna 100 created self-doubt. Lama knew if he had to make it, he had to work harder. Coming back from Pokhara, he then started to take part in the KTM Trail Series. He also started exploring photography.
That is when he met Jimmy Oostrum, a trail runner, who is helping him get to Val D’Aran.
“I met Jeevan during these KTM Trail Series races. He was curious and always looking to help conduct these races by marking trails and documenting it through photos and videos,” says Oostrum. “He was really humble and always looking to learn. It was really nice to see someone who hadn’t been running from a young age put in the effort he did to get better at it.”
Despite him helping organise races, his goal remained the same. In 2019, Jeevan Lama returned to Annapurna to compete in the 100 km race. He came prepared this time, both mentally and physically.
But, he was defeated. Yet his intention was fulfilled. He wanted to finish, and he did, which was huge for his morale.
He even went to India to compete in trail races there to see where he stood in Asia. Even though he did not win, he still managed to test himself.
Recently, Jeevan Lama took part in the Manjushree Trail Race, Nepal’s first 100-mile ultra-marathon along the ridge of the Kathmandu valley. This is also the only ITRA-certified 100-mile trail race in Nepal.  Surprisingly, he won.
“I had always dreamt of running 100 miles and I did it. It felt great to have finished the race. Winning was the icing on the cake,” says Lama.
That was when Oostrum saw how much of an athlete he was.
“We knew he was interested to run, but he beat people who’d competed in UTMB races and won gold. That was surprising to us because we never saw him as a racer, but he proved to us he was one,” says Oostrum.
Watching his dedication to the sport, Oostrum felt it was time Jeevan Lama raced on the big stage.
“His story is special. Running changed his life in many ways. He took himself from the darkness of drug addiction into light, which was very nice to see. And since both he and Rashila Tamang were helping us out do these weekend runs and raced without asking for anything in return, we felt we had to help them out and wanted to take them to compete in a major race which could make their careers and encourage more Nepali runners to pick up trail running,” says Oostrum.
This is why Lama wants to run the Val D’Aran and make people who have trusted in him proud. He wants to make himself proud and with it spread the message that there is a way out of addiction.
“I talk about this openly because I want to be an example. I know there is a person suffering from addiction in almost every household and I hope that this shows people it’s not the end of the world.”
Jeevan Lama hopes that him doing well in the Val D’Aran will also send a positive message as more and more athletes will take part in trail races taking place in the country.
“I really want to do well and take part in the UTMB in Chamonix in France. This would be great for the scene in the country,” says Lama.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/jeevan-lama-trail-runner-nepal.html,sports
5 most controversial sportspersons in Nepal you should know about,"Wednesday, June 22, 2022","With Nepal’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) electing the new leadership, the future of Abdullah Al Mutairi as the coach of the Nepal national team is at stake. It is not only because the new president has sour relationships with the Kuwaiti coach, but Al Mutairi’s stint in Nepal is filled with a lot of other controversies too. In less than one and a half years, he has established himself as one of the most controversial sportspersons in Nepal.
A few months ago, the former captain of Nepal’s national football team, Hari Khadka, was convicted of forging academic documents by the Special Court, dragging himself to the centre of controversy in the country’s sports sector.
There are many controversial sportspersons in the country. Sports personalities playing, coaching or managing different sports–be it football, marathon or any–have time and again made the headlines for all positive as well as negative reasons. And, here, we bring you the list of the most controversial sportspersons in the country.
Abdullah Al Mutairi is one of the most loved coaches of the Nepali men’s football teams. Yet, he has been dragged into controversy several times. In July 2021, he was accused of misbehaving with a female journalist while she was reporting in the ANFA complex.
The controversy does not end here. In the same month, the head coach announced his resignation on his social media account. But, he did not submit a resignation letter to the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), making himself one of the most controversial sportspersons in Nepal.
Following the incident, ANFA received flak from thousands of Nepali football fans. They accused the football governing body of being involved in politics to oust Al Mutairi.
This is not the end of the story.  Again, in October, the coach announced that he will step down after the SAFF championship final. In a post-match conference of the SAFF Championship, after a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh, he announced that he would resign from the post and would never come back to Nepal.
However, the coach could not stay with his decision. In fact, he extended the contract with Nepal. As per the renewed contract, Almutairi would coach the national team till 2024 end. But, he again had a feud with senior players of the team. Investigating the case, the football governing body has recommended for terminating his contract.
On January 26, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a corruption case against Hari Khadka at the Special Court. He was accused of forgery during his service in Nepal Police and also found guilty. He was charged a fine of Rs 5,000 for the offence.
Khadka was appointed the assistant inspector of Nepal Police in 1998. To get this job, he had submitted a fake intermediate level certificate from the Higher Secondary Council of Varanasi, India. Based on the same certificate, he also got promoted to the sub-inspector’s position in 2002.
Despite being one of the most controversial sportspersons in the country, Khadka, a former coach of the national women’s team, is the head of the Women’s Football Department at the All Nepal Football Association, Nepal’s football governing body.
Former national football team skipper Sagar Thapa–along with deputy Sandip Rai, goalkeeper Ritesh Thapa, defender Bikash Singh Chhetri, coach Anjan KC, and physio Dejib Thapa–was arrested by Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Range on October 14, 2015, on the charge of treason and match-fixing in domestic and international games.
It was claimed that they had received large sums of money and deliberately lost many matches between 2008 and 2014. The matches included those of World Cup qualifiers 2011, Asian Games, Nehru Cup, Merdeka Cup, SAFF Championship, and international friendlies.
Consequently, all the players were provisionally suspended by the All Nepal Football Association and Asian Football Confederation and imposed a life ban by the Asian Football Confederation.
The footballers were acquitted of all the charges by the Special Court and the Supreme Court in 2018 and 2020. However, they could not erase the charge of being controversial sportspersons.
Rajendra Bhandari had secured two gold medals in the 3000 m steeplechase and 5,000m race at the 2006 South Asian Games, which was a record in itself. But, soon, the controversial sportsperson was stripped of the medals when he was caught doping.
In a doping test, the presence of the anabolic steroid, norandrosteronelt, was found in his body. That substance is prohibited by the world anti-doping agency. But, Bhandari said he did not know how the substance got into his body as he used to take supplements under the super as the report of the doping test was revealed only after a month which otherwise would take 24 hours.
Athlete Tilak Ram Tharu also takes place in the list of controversial sportspersons.  In 2014, Tharu hid in South Korea under the pretext of participating in the 17th Asian Games. Along with him, three other national players also hid out in South Korea.
The controversial sportsperson had a national record in 200-metre and 400-metre races. Similarly, he has also been the national champion of 100-metre, 200-metre, and 400-metre races. Tharu is also an olympian. He participated in London Olympics in 2012, representing Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/controversial-sportspersons-nepal.html,sports

Nepal T20 League: Agreement singed with Seven3Sports as per Indian law,"Sunday, June 19, 2022","Kathmandu, June 19
The agreement signed between the Cricket Association of Nepal and Seven3Sports, an Indian sports management company, for the first edition of the Nepal T20 League has been done so according to the Indian law, claim sources.
CAN has given all commercial and strategic rights to Seven3Sports to organise the T20 competition for the next eight years. The agreement signed between the two is for Rs 330 million.
In the recently signed agreement between the two parties, whose copy Onlinekhabar obtained recently, it is clearly stated that any dispute will be settled as per Indian laws. Point 21 of the agreement states that if there is any dispute unsolved within 15 days, the dispute will be solved as per the Indian law in New Delhi.
Meanwhile, CAN Secretary Prashant Bikram Malla says that this is not a big deal.
“The point is there if there are any disputes between two parties,” says Malla. “There was a talk of doing it in Singapore, but we decided on New Delhi because it would be a lot cheaper.”
Along with this, the agreement also states that Seven3Sports will also have the right to organise other competitions like the T10, T20 and T30 leagues in the near future along with all junior cricket championships. Seven3Sports will also have the right to hold player drafts, choose franchisees and appoint sponsors and partners for Nepal T20 League.
Malla from CAN, however, says the national cricket body has not sold any rights apart from that of the Nepal T20 League and the other agreement is for the benefit of cricket in Nepal.
“We will only give them other leagues if we decide to conduct them,” says Malla.
Malla says Seven3Sports is also hosting a junior cricket championship, a talent hunt that will be the foundation for Nepal T20 League. He says that the players from the junior cricket championship will go to India to play cricket.
“They are helping us with this,” says Malla.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-t20-league-agreement.html,sports
"Abdullah Al Mutairi: Regardless of who will win the ANFA election, the head coach is likely to lose","Saturday, June 18, 2022","The future of Nepali football will be determined on Monday as the members of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) will decide who will lead the Nepali football governing body for the next four years. The first job of the person who wins the elections will be to decide what to do with Nepali national team coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
But, regardless of who will win the elections, it is likely that the controversial coach will not find any favour for him.
Al Mutairi has been a controversial figure ever since he has taken the hot seat of Nepali football. Recently, he took an under-strength football team to the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers in Kuwait. He decided to omit 10 key players due to his differences with them and took Nepal to the qualifiers where the team lost all three games, capping it off with an embarrassing 7-0 defeat against Indonesia.
The players have returned to Nepal, but Abdullah Al Mutairi has not as he has taken a medical leave.
“He had taken a medical leave before we left for Kuwait. He has to undergo some tests and treatment; that will take some time,” informs ANFA’s general secretary Indra Man Tuladhar.
Abdullah Al Mutairi has been suffering from heart-related illness for quite some time. He has repeatedly told the media how he had to quit playing football due to this. The situation got worse during the game against Kuwait when he collapsed during the match. He was immediately rushed to the hospital.
But, there are people who argue that Abdullah Al Mutairi has not returned with the team as he is waiting for ANFA election results as he feels his future hinges on the who becomes the president of the governing body.
Why? There are two reasons.
The first is his dispute with the senior players who left camp on April 25 after having a dispute with Abdullah Al Mutairi. The panel formed by ANFA to investigate the case had asked the governing body to find an alternative to Al Mutairi, after the Asian Cup Qualifier. ANFA officials have continuously said that the new president of ANFA will make the decision on his future.
Secondly, Al Mutairi’s relationship with presidential candidate Pankaj Nembang has not been that great. He even said he was resigning, as he could no longer work with a person like Nembang.
And with Nembang and Karma Tsering Sherpa locking horns for the ANFA presidency, it will be interesting to see what the elected president will do with Al Mutairi. It is almost certain that Nembang will heed the advice given by the ANFA panel and sack Al Mutairi.
Even if Sherpa is elected, it is likely that he too will seek an alternative to Abdullah Al Mutairi. The 10 players who left the team are also likely to make a comeback and it would be hard for them to work with a coach with whom they have had a dispute. So, if Sherpa wants the team to do well, he will have to change the coach.
ANFA’s former president Narendra Shrestha believes that it was best that ANFA found an alternative to Al Mutairi.
“How can they play for a coach they don’t respect? It won’t be good for the team,” says Shrestha. “The panel has also recommended that ANFA find an alternative so I think whoever wins the election, Al Mutairi will be removed.”
Al Mutairi was sent by the Qatar Football Association under a grant to coach the Nepal national football team. The QFA bears all his expenses. Initially, he had signed a one-year contract with ANFA in April 2021. He signed a three-year extension after taking Nepal to the finals of the SAFF Championship in October 2021.
Since his appointment, Al Mutairi has taken charge of 20 matches. He has taken leadership in trying to improve the team, playing many friendly matches with better opposition.
“He’s done a lot of good for Nepali football too,” says football analyst Sanjeev Mishra.
He has also given chance to a lot of young players. A total of 15 players made their debut under Al Mutairi. This is double the number of players who made their debut under Bal Gopal Maharjan.

Sukra Bahadur Rai: Nepal number 1 golfer’s rise into the game of the rich,"Sunday, June 12, 2022","One fine day some 11 years ago, Sukra Bahadur Rai stumbled into a golf course. The eighth-grader had given into the peer pressure, but no way had he thought that he would become a professional golfer one day. Yet, he is grateful that the day gave him a decade-long career in golf.
Golf has always been considered the game of the rich, yet Sukra Bahadur Rai’s family were labourers. Rai otherwise would have been an outcast, but his success today is inspiring many to become golfers like him. “Determination can overcome any limitation,” he says.
He grew up in a normal family living in Chokibari of Dharan sub-metropolis-19. His father still works as a construction worker.
Sukra Bahadur Rai first started at Dharan Golf Course as a caddy boy in the hope of earning a few hundred rupees while he was still in school. He did not have a good financial background. Then, he started playing the competition for caddies, in which he showed exceptional gaming prowess from the start. He started being noticed by the members of the course, and with the support of those who liked his game, his journey became easier.
After two years, when he reached the junior national team of the Nepal Golf Association, he no longer saw a shortage of sports equipment and minimal income. Rai then played in the senior competitions in 2014 as an amateur player.
He won gold as a team and bronze medals in the individual sections at the 13th South Asian Games in Nepal in 2019. After that, he became known as one of the most promising players in Nepali golf. But interestingly, a year before he even won the gold, he had beaten the top pro players of Nepal.
In 2019, Sukra Bahadur Rai transcended the levels of professionals (pro golfers) from the amateur level. Within just two and a half years, with his recent win in the Surya Nepal Premier Golf held at Gokarna Golf Course last Thursday, he has now achieved the top rank among the Nepali golfers.
He also won three matches in the 2021/22 season of the Surya Nepal Golf Tour. He played in five of the eight competitions of the season and won a total of Rs 663,500 including three titles. The competition in the season and the handsome prize money also further motivated him, he shares. “On the second and third days, I was able to perform as planned. However, on the third day, I could not achieve my goal to perform better and set a record,” he says. Rai holds a record in under-22 at Gokarna Golf Course.
In the last stage, he won three under-69 brackets and under-19 brackets with an overall scorecard of 269. He beat another Dharan-based professional golfer Niraj Tamang by six strokes.
It was after Sukra Bahadur Rai’s win at the 13th SAG that he decided to become a professional golfer to up his gaming.
However, that decision was not right when the Covid pandemic broke out. It put a halt on all national and international activities, sports and otherwise. It took a toll on him.
“In the first lockdown, it was okay. I got to play on the golf course in Dharan and I kept myself fit, But, then, in the second lockdown, there was a higher transmission rate, I had to stay at home and it affected me mentally and physically.
“During the lockdown, I started questioning why I got the professional status at this time,” he shares as he had just achieved his motive to become a professional some months ago.
For one to participate in Asian Business Tour, it is mandatory to play professional competition in India. So, six months before the lockdown, Sukra Bahadur Rai got selected and did well on the tour. The competition organised by the Professional Golfers Association of India was a good opportunity for him to gain experience. He aims to establish himself by winning at least one contest next season also.
Recently, a month ago, he played six matches in the first season, “I did well in the selection, but I could not perform well in the first season as per my expectations. The next season is starting in September. I hope to perform well and be enlisted in the top 60.”
In Sukra Bahadur Rai’s experience, becoming a professional golfer is a stressful responsibility. In golf, amateur players do not win cash prizes while these players are represented in official international competitions through the sports federation.
But, the pro golfers themselves have to make all arrangements from getting a caddy to a trainer.
The Nepal Golf Association had gifted him a set of golf equipment when he bid farewell to his amateur status.
He remembers that the set helped him a lot in training when he could not participate in the competition for a long time during the pandemic.
When Sukra Bahadur Rai started playing golf, Shivaram Shrestha was the number one golfer in Nepal. When Rai saw Shrestha playing for the first time in the Surya Nepal Masters at Gokarna Golf Course, he imagined himself in the same place.
As he wished, Rai today has achieved the title of Nepal’s number one golfer. His dream has been achieved. But, he still wishes to get the same level of success in his professional career as he did in his amateur career.
Today, Rai trains with Sabin Sapkota, who is currently in Germany. “He has taught me a lot since I was in Dharan. Even now, I am getting a lot of knowledge from him, virtually.”
The biggest thing is to become financially strong and he is looking for sponsorship too. But, Sukra Bahadur Rai says he is optimistic about the future because a lot of people are hoping for his success.

Govt’s imbalanced plans keep most sportspeople in Nepal demotivated forever,"Saturday, June 11, 2022","Nepal does not have its own sports policy. Neither does it have plans for the sector’s management and sustainability. The priority of the sports sector is evaluated according to the government’s annual policy and programme and the budget plan.
For a long time, the government has been including the sports sector in its programme and policy to motivate the players. The players’ prizes, allowances, and social security are included separately in the title of ‘motivation’.
But, stakeholders argue to make the players successful on a global platform should have been a priority as it is a real motivation. However, due to a lack of sustainable policy, there has been a dearth of development in infrastructure, training and regular competition except for a few highlighted sports such as cricket, leaving players in other disciplines demotivated forever.
Recent policy and programme and the budget plan announced for the upcoming fiscal year 2022/23 have not been any different.
The prizes awarded to the players for their successful performance in international competitions by the government and non-government sectors are generally considered motivation in the Nepali sports sector.
“The motivation for players can be observed from various angles. The provision of reward and lifetime allowances for players who succeeded in an international competition is considered as motivation,” says Deepak Shrestha, president of the National and International Players Association, also a two-time gold medalist at the South Asian Games.
In the current year’s budget plan, the government proposed a programme of providing a subsidised loan for the retired players willing to start a business. But, it is unknown whether the programme introduced to motivate the players met its purpose. Even the players are clueless about the programme.
“We were happy to see such a programme by the government. We even thanked the ministry and National Sports Council. But, till one year, no concerned body stepped up for its implementation,” says Shrestha. “The ministry and the NSC haven’t been found informing players about the procedure of loan”.
In the new budget plan, the government has announced providing a lifetime allowance for the players who have bagged medals in Olympic and Asian Games.
Shrestha is amazed by such a programme in the budget because it was already introduced seven years ago and has been implemented since then.
Even the gold medalists of SAG have already been receiving lifetime allowances. But, this year’s budget does not mention anything about the SAG medalists.
“I have found the players (SAG medalists) anxious thinking whether they will stop receiving the allowance that they have been getting,” says Shrestha.
Not a priority
The sports sector, which only receives 0.18 per cent of the total budget, has not been a priority of the government.
Sufficient infrastructures, regular training and international participation are the real motivation for the players. But, there is not a sufficient budget to conduct a close camp, says Shrestha.
“We are in need of budget management and its efficient implementation for developing the sports sector. The poor management and a lack of priority are creating hassles in the work that is mandatory for the growth of the sector,” says Shrestha.
Experts also argue that the government is adopting the wrong way to motivate players.
“The cash price given to the players after they receive medals in international competition is not a motivation, that is a respect,” says Achyut Lamichhane, A sports expert. “The players also receive a lifetime allowance after winning medals in the Olympics and Asian Games.  But, the real motivation is not about rewarding; it is about making them capable of winning.”
Everyone who participated in international events cannot win. So, the government should ensure the security of all those players and create a favourable environment for them to win the medals. “That is a real motivation,” says Lamichhane.

Andrew Leonard: This foreigner is synonymous with Nepal’s live cricket commentaries,"Friday, May 27, 2022","For Andrew Leonard, Nepal is like a second home. He has been coming to the country since 2018, commentating on the many cricketing events that have taken place here. Every time you begin a Nepal game on live television, you are sure to hear him talk. His voice, over the course of the past four years, has become synonymous with Nepali cricket.
“Nepal, its people and its cricket team hold a special place in my heart,” says Leonard from his home in Ireland. “The love that I’ve received in the country is just amazing. I can’t wait to come back.”
Now with every visit to the country, he wants to share what he knows about broadcasting. He hopes that what he shares will come in handy to the people involved in the growth of broadcasting in the country which, he says, has come a long way since he first came to do commentary here.
Andrew Leonard has not been into commentary for long. After playing cricket for most of his life and working with the Ireland Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council (ICC), he jumped into the commentary box in the summer of 2017. At first, he was sceptical, but after a few games, he realised he was made for this.
“I took to the commentary as a duck takes to water. People started to tell me I should do this more and the next thing I know I was doing commentary in a match between Ireland and Afghanistan,” he says. “After that, there was no turning back.”
Prior to his commentary stint, Andrew Leonard had been an avid supporter of associate cricket. During his time in the ICC, he pushed for them to show more games of associate cricket for the passionate followers in the respective countries. He knew there was interest from the many people who tuned in to ICC’s website to check scores. The most number of viewers on the website would always be from Nepal.
“The test game has always had coverage, but when it came to associate cricket, there wasn’t much the ICC did and that’s what I always campaigned for. Thankfully, the people who made the decisions agreed and the coverage increased,” he says.
Because of his love for the associate game, he started to commentate on it and that’s what caught the eyes of Nepali broadcasters who asked him to be a part of the commentary team for the Everest Premier League in 2018.
“It was great to be a part of it.”
But, soon, Andrew Leonard realised that the setup in Nepal was very rudimentary. The passion of the people running it and the love of the fan for the sport though made up for it. But, he knew with time, things would get better.
Things have got better, but that was majorly due to the EPL contracting people from India to help with the broadcasting. But, he does not see it as a problem because, in the long run, it will help develop the capacity of Nepalis working in live sports broadcasting. He says that is what Aamir Akhtar, the founder of EPL, wants to do.
“He tells me how it was necessary to bring in these people from abroad because Nepalis have never done this. But, in the long run, he wants everything to be done by Nepalis. He wants to build the capacity of teams, the marketing team and broadcasters and make this self-sufficient,” adds Andrew Leonard.
But, there are challenges. Live sporting events are rare in the country. Any franchise league lasts a little over a month and after the event is over, these people are back to doing their regular jobs.
“I’m sure people would like to do more of it. But sadly they have to go back to doing things like Nepal Idol, which doesn’t help them as they don’t evolve,” he says.
Another issue is technology. Nepal’s technology, when it comes to broadcasting, is basic. Until a few years ago, television companies did not have a replay machine. Some commentators complain they do not even have proper microphones, but things are changing as television companies in the country are realising that there is money in live sports.
“We had a talkback machine for the first time. These are the little things that help create a better experience for the viewers.”
Andrew Leonard believes that with more games taking place in the country, it is about time the country focused on commentators too. He says there are some good people in the country who need time and confidence boost to reach the next level.
“Because English isn’t their first language, it’s hard for them. But, they are getting better with each tournament.”
He says that since cricket commentary is mostly about conversation, they are also learning the conversational aspect of the game.
“There are people who don’t know when to talk and there are some who don’t know when to stop. I think this will get better as they spend more time on the commentary box. An example is Paresh Lohani who I love working with. We’ve developed a relationship in the box and outside of it and I hope more people can do that in the future,” says Andrew Leonard.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/andrew-leonard-cricket-commentary.html,sports
EPL files writ petition at Supreme Court demanding CAN sanction,"Thursday, May 26, 2022","Kathmandu, May 26
The Everest Premier League (EPL) has said that it has filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court against the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) asking the apex court for an interim stay order to stop CAN from going ahead with its plan to start its own T20 league.
In a statement released on Thursday, the league organisers have said that its founders and all six franchises have unanimously decided to seek appropriate legal recourse as per the prevalent laws of Nepal.
“We have full faith and humbly believe the judiciary will grant us an appropriate remedy,” the EPL statement reads.
The organisers also say their statement released on May 23 was not a threat to CAN. In the statement, the EPL had said that all six franchises that are owned by the country’s leading corporate groups would be boycotting all sporting programmes CAN will hold from now onwards.
“The sole intention of the press conference held by EPL and other stakeholders was only to request CAN to hear our request and grant us approval to organise the 5th edition of EPL-T20. It is reiterated that no threatening remarks were directed at CAN in any manner whatsoever,” says the statement.
The statement also says CAN is going against the laws of Nepal to private agreement with a foreign company that would be used in the broadcasting of the forthcoming Nepal T20 League.

"CAN increases cricketers, ground staff’ salaries","Wednesday, May 25, 2022","Kathmandu, May 25
Nepali cricket’s governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), has increased the salaries of both men and women cricketers.
A meeting of the central committee on Tuesday decided to increase the salaries of male cricketers with the central contract by Rs 10,000.
CAN started to offer central contracts to players from 2017 onwards and has divided them into three grades – A, B and C and paid them Rs 25,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively.
Since then, salaries have increased regularly. This is the third increment, after which players from grades A, B and C will now earn Rs 60,000, 50,000 and 40,000 a month respectively.
Similarly, the salaries of women cricketers have increased too. The board has decided to increase the salaries of women cricketers in grades A and B by Rs 6,000 and those in Grade C by Rs 5,000.
Now, women cricketers in grades A, B and C will earn Rs 21,000, 18,000 and 15,000 a month respectively.
The grading is done by the board on the basis of the player’s performance in the calendar year.
CAN has also increased the salaries of the ground staff by Rs 3,000. Similarly, the ground’s office assistant and pitch curator’s salaries have increased by Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 respectively.

EPL organisers and teams to boycott CAN events if their league isn’t sanctioned,"Tuesday, May 24, 2022","Kathmandu, May 24
The organisers and teams of the Everest Premier League have warned the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) that they will boycott all events held by CAN if it does not sanction EPL for its fifth season.
In a statement released on Monday, the organisers said all six franchises that are owned by the country’s leading corporate groups would be boycotting all sporting programmes CAN will hold from now onwards.
This comes after CAN announced the formation of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) which all but killed the EPL as the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not recognise more than one official franchise league in a country.
Chatur Bahadur Chand, CAN’s president, during the launch had said that there would not be another T20 tournament in the country.
This has left the organisers and owners of the EPL teams disappointed as both feel that they did a lot for Nepali cricket at a time when CAN was suspended by the ICC.
“We welcome CAN’s decision to hold an event like this, but we feel a tournament that’s been held for four years needs to continue,” says Amir Akhtar, the EPL founder. “We feel the players will benefit from having more than one competition.”
Owners of the teams also feel betrayed.
“We didn’t spend millions to earn immediate profit. We spent money because we love the sport and want to see it develop in the country,” says Kishor Maharjan, the owner of Lalitpur Patriots. Maharjan says he feels decisions like these will discourage people from investing in sports and its development.
Chitwan Tigers’ owner Kishor Bhattarai says CAN is being unfair to them and hints maybe politics had a role in this.
“Every time there is a change in leadership, things change. CAN didn’t even speak to us once before taking this decision and that is what is discouraging,” says Bhattarai.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/epl-to-boycott-can.html,sports
Nepal women’s cricket team’s loss of Uganda series: Captain Rubina Chhetry points out 5 reasons,"Monday, May 23, 2022","Nepali women’s cricket team recently lost their first international women’s T-20 series held on its home pitch, TU International Cricket Stadium, Kirtipur. The hosts lost the series to Uganda who are three ranks below Nepal. This event has scaled the status of the Nepali women’s cricket team.
Nepal stand in the 16th rank in women’s ICC T-20 ranking whereas Uganda stands in the 19th. The captain of the Nepali women’s cricket team, Rubina Chhetry, on the occasion, points out five reasons why Nepal lost the series even in the home stadium.
From the beginning of the series, the Nepal women’s cricket team were seen misfielding, eventually losing three matches. “The players repeatedly dropped the catches and were also unable to run properly,” says Chhetry during a press meet. “Our coach Jagat Tamata had alerted us about this from the beginning.”
She adds, “We lost the series due to all these mistakes. We made a lot of misfields. On top of that, our players’ fitness level was also low. Though the players claimed that they even maintained their fitness in the off-season, it didn’t show on the field.” Chhetry believes that all those misfields were conducted due to a lack of fitness.
In this series, neither senior nor younger players performed as expected. Rubina Chhetry, Sita Rana Magar and Sarita Magar are among the senior players of the Nepal women’s cricket team. Recently, the Cricket Association of Nepal appointed Indu Burma as the vice-captain replacing Sita Rana Magar.
“Although young players were given chance to play in the international series, they couldn’t perform well,” says Chhetry. “We believed in those young players and gave them a chance to play, but they could not prove themselves even after getting such a big opportunity.”
Further, she says, “Our team has this expectation that senior players like me and Sita Rana Magar would eventually cover for all team members. Of course, we too need to play well, but they too need to realise their responsibility and give their best on the field.”
From the beginning of the series, Nepal were not able to set a proper aim for Uganda. Whether it be six overs powerplay, middle over or dead over, Nepal did not make enough runs.
“The players need to analyse properly on the field. Then only they can utilise their skills and take advantage of the situation. Not being able to take advantage on the field is another weakness, which our team needs to improve,” says Chhetry.
Nepal women’s cricket team’s weak batting also played a big role in losing the first match by 16 runs, the second by one wicket and the third by six wickets. From the first match coach, Tamata had pointed out these issues.
Akin to Tamata, Captain Rubina Chhetry also says the team’s batting is weak. Nepal are set to play ICC Asia Cup Qualifiers next month.  With this form in batting, it will be very challenging for the Nepali team to play the qualifiers.
The current series Nepal played against Uganda is their first international match in one and a half years.“Due to a long hiatus in training and matches because of the pandemic, the players couldn’t bring good results,” says the captain of the team. This is Nepal’s first international match after they played the T-20 series against Qatar, last year.
“If players compete in matches frequently either in national or international games, the women’s cricket team can improve their performance,” says Chhetry.
After Nepal lost three matches against Uganda continuously, Concy Aweko, the captain for Uganda says that the Nepal women’s cricket team members had weak psychology.
“Nepali cricket team are good, but in cricket, the players’ psychology also makes a huge difference in the competition,” says Aweko.  “We do not understand the Nepali language, but we felt that Nepali cricketers were unhappy looking at their gestures. So we took advantage of their mindset.”
The captain of the team, Chhetry, also agrees with Aweko.

Nepal football controversy: ANFA panel wants to terminate Abdullah Al Mutairi but blames players too,"Saturday, May 21, 2022","Kathmandu, May 21
Nepal’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), has made public recommendations made by a task force formed to look into the recent controversy in Nepal football.
The key recommendation of the panel includes seeking an alternative to the current coach, Abdullah Al Mutairi, after the Asian Cup Qualifier happening next month will be over.
The committee led by former footballer Victor Rana says Al Mutairi’s interference in managerial affairs of ANFA and his controversial social media presence have hampered the harmony of the Nepal football team.
Besides, the panel has held the ANFA secretariat, the team manager as well as players also responsible for the recent incident in which the players left the training and publicly accused the head coach of misbehaviour.
Whereas the panel has told ANFA to ensure appropriate training facilities for the players, it has also suggested adopting a zero-tolerance policy in cases of violation of set discipline.
In the last week of April, 10 players of the national team had left the camp after arguments with their coach Abdullah Al Mutairi. The coach has already called in new players to replace them.

Dream Phapla: A campaign for the development of an international cricket stadium in Sudurpaschim,"Thursday, May 19, 2022","Finally, there is a confirmation of the construction of the Phapla International Cricket Stadium.
Its construction is about to take place soon as the Ministry of Youth and Sports has published the Phapla Cricket Ground and Sports Village Infrastructure Development Committee Order, 2022, in the Nepal Gazette.
The government had decided to give priority to the construction process of the Phapla International Cricket Stadium in the current fiscal year’s budget. Hence, according to the gazette, a nine-member development committee will be formed for the same. There is a provision for the government to appoint a person with experience in sports management as the chairperson.
The cabinet meeting on January 24 decided to provide land for the Phapla International Cricket Stadium in Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city ward 3, Kailali district.
The mayors of the Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city and Krishnapur municipality in the neighbouring Kanchanpur district will be appointed as members of the nine-member committee. Likewise, the secretary of the Sports Ministry of the Sudurpaschim provincial government, the chief district officer of Kailali, a representative from the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, the head of the Federal Project Implementation Unit in Kailali, the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kailali, and reputed women who have contributed to the sports sector would be nominated as the members of the committee.
According to a source, the Ministry of Sports may give the responsibility of the executive director to civil servants holding the position equivalent to undersecretary to look after the administrative responsibility of the project.
The executive director will be responsible for preparing the project report, DPR of the project, and setting the annual budget, plans and programmes. The executive director will also be a member-secretary of the development committee member.
Likewise, the development committee will be responsible for preparing a detailed report of the project, conducting a preliminary environmental impact assessment, managing the necessary budget for construction, completing the infrastructure work and bringing the stadium into operation and handing it over to the government.
The committee will serve for three years. According to the gazette, if the Phapla project is not completed in the given time, the Nepal government could extend the working period twice, one year per extension.
In 2015, under the leadership of Subash Shahi, the Dream Phapla campaign was commenced. Since then, in every government, the far-west region has put its effort into building an international cricket stadium in Phapla.
Meanwhile, Shahi has shown gratitude towards the current government for announcing organising the first franchise cricket competition of Nepal.
“This was not just a dream of Kailali, but of the entire far-western region. That is why it was included as a national priority project,” says Shahi. “I hope that after the formation order for the development committee, the construction process will pick its speed.”
“After a long wait and struggle, we have made it happen,” he adds. Shahi is hopeful that the construction process of the Phapla cricket stadium will be completed in an estimated time.

Nepal’s governing body for football, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), has decided to investigate the incident involving national team players and coach Albullah Al Mutairi.

"Nepal football controversy: Abdullah Al Mutairi forgives players, but isn’t he responsible for a solution?","Tuesday, May 3, 2022","At a press conference last Thursday, 10 players of the Nepal football team made a serious accusation against their head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi. According to them, the head coach imposed dictatorship in the camp and publicly said that the coach put mental pressure on them.
Then, it was Al Mutairi’s turn to resort to the press and tell his side of the story. On Sunday, he released a letter to the football governing body, ANFA, saying he forgave the players and asked ANFA also not to take action against them.
Without ANFA or the Ministry of Sports probing the controversy, Abdullah Al Mutairi, in his statement, has apparently tried to prove himself innocent and blame the ‘rebel’ players for the Nepal football crisis.
But, is it so?
The players say they do not have any issue accepting Abdullah Al Mutairi as their coach. But for now, they say they are not able to bear his misbehaviour, so as a result, they left the camp.  Likewise, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the football governing body, is also disappointed with Al Mutairi’s misbehaviour towards the players when they asked him about the substandard facility in the close camp.
On the other hand, Al Mutairi is reckoned as one of the most successful coaches in Nepal. During his tenure, Nepal played the final of the SAFF Championship and reached the third round of Asian Cup qualifiers.
Since the beginning of his tenure as the coach, Abdullah Al Mutairi’s attitude has been questioned and controversy has always revolved around him. Although he seems successful on the field, in the dressing room, he is not.
He has been using social media as a weapon to win the hearts of Nepali football supporters from the very beginning. He has once again tried to show that he is innocent in the eyes of the supporters. For that, he has written a letter to the general secretary of ANFA, Indra Man Tuladhar, requesting him not to take any action against the players he has removed from the team. His letter claims that the players’ decision to quit the camp without prior notice has affected him.
“Please understand that the unilateral actions of players have hurt me deeply,” reads Abdullah Al Mutairi’s letter. “ Furthermore, I forgive the players for their slanderous remarks against me. I also humbly request you to not punish these players for the mistakes they have committed.”
Players, on the other hand, have claimed Abdullah Al Mutairi has asked them to return home. Al Mutairi, who wants to establish his superiority by being nice to the players, has stayed silent about the accusation levelled against him by them. Rather than recognising the players’ allegations, he is urging that the authority excuse the players.
Currently, 10 players have stated that they do not wish to be mentored by Al Mutairi. On the other side, the coach has stated those players will not be recalled for the Asian Cup team selection owing to their faults. The coach has already recruited 17 new players and has continued training in an alternative to those 10 players.
The players have demanded an investigation into the issue and a penalty for the perpetrator. It is critical to recognise the perpetrator and take action against him. In this situation, however, the football regulatory body, ANFA, has remained unconcerned.
Since the ANFA’s election is approaching, the officials do not want any controversy, therefore they must remain defensive by being silent. ANFA is obligated to stay unconcerned about Abdullah Al Mutairi’s flaws. They are concerned that Qatar Football Association, Nepal’s primary ally, will be disappointed.
The head coach, who had resigned from the Nepali national team 10 months ago, has extended his contract with the support of the Qatar Football Association. An incident like this, which occurred near the ANFA election date, can have a consequence on Nepali players’ performance in international matches.
The current controversy began with senior player Rohit Chand expressing concerns about the ANFA hostel, where national players were accommodated during the Asian Cup qualifier selection procedure. He requested that either the hostel’s facilities be improved or the players be relocated to the hotel. Other players expressed support for his plea as well.
Afterwards, the head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi misbehaved with Chand and sent him home. While protesting against the misbehaving that Chand faced, other senior players also went through similar behaviour by the coach. This propelled the players to leave the camp.
For a decade, ANFA used to lodge the players in the hostel. According to players, ANFA should be questioned for its mismanagement and substandard facility for the players.
Six months ago, the Nepali cricket team also witnessed a similar situation.  At that time, during the dispute between players and associations, the coach supported the players.
But, in the football scene now, ANFA has received flak from different areas for remaining indifferent.
Meanwhile, ANFA says it is working out to resolve the issue that surfaced after the charges against Abdullah AL Mutairi.
“We are holding conversations with both the parties.  Everyone should be flexible from their side. One should strictly fulfil their responsibility,” says Karma Tsering Sherpa, the ANFA president.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/abdullah-al-mutairi-not-innocent.html,sports

The coach of the Nepal football team, Abdullah Al Mutairi has released a statement regarding the recent controversy surrounding the national football team. In the statement, Al Mutairi has asked the All Nepal Football Association to come up with a solution.
Al Mutairi in the statement addressed to ANFA‘s general secretary Indra Man Tuladhar has said that he is deeply hurt by the allegations made by the players and adds that despite that, he has forgiven the players who have left camp and has also asked ANFA not to take any actions against them.
“I, as a guardian of all players of the national team, can understand the impulse of the young blood that led to an uncomfortable situation,” he writes.
Even though he says that he has forgiven the players, he does add that he will not be taking the players to the Asian Cup Qualifiers as he believes that it is in the best interest of the team.
“I will take full responsibility for the performance of the national team,” he writes. “But I, as the coach and chief selector of the national team, have both the authority and responsibility to build a team.”

"Nepal football controversy: 10 players leave training, accuse coach of ill-treatment","Thursday, April 28, 2022","Kathmandu, April 28
Just before the national football team were due to leave to take part in the Asia Cup Qualifiers, 10 members of the Nepal football team have left the camp.
The players say that they were compelled to leave the camp due to Nepal’s national team coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
“We wanted to solve the issue internally. But, because fingers are being pointed at us, we have decided to speak about the issue openly,” the Nepal football players issued a public statement amid a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday, one day after leaving the training.
Rohit Chand, Anjan Bista, Bimal Gharti Magar, Ananta Tamang, Bishal Rai, Bishal Shrestha, Sujal Shrestha, Tej Tamang, Dinesh Rajbanshi and Suman Lama left the hotel they were being kept at.
The players say that they were left disappointed by the way the coach spoke to them when they demanded basic rights for the players.
“We are proud to represent Nepal. We love it so much that we sometimes disregard the club career that is important to us financially and play for the country whenever called upon. But, the way we have been treated by the coach is disgusting,” the Nepal footballers’ statement reads.
They say that the disagreement started when Chand asked the coach where they were staying. When the coach told them that the players would stay in ANFA’s hostel, Chand said the players needed to stay in a better facility as the hostel belonging to the Nepal football governing body did not have proper facilities.
The players say that when Chand stood up against this, the coach told him if he did not want to stay in the hostel, he could leave. The coach talking to senior players like Chand did not go down well with other players who supported Chand. Al Mutairi then asked everyone who was supporting Chand to leave.
“We wanted to hold discussions with the coach, but he doesn’t listen. Nor does ANFA and that is why we had to leave. We didn’t leave because we didn’t want to. We left because we weren’t being treated well,” reads their report.
The players also accused the coach of telling them that he would not choose them until he remained the head coach of the national team.

No grassroots: Abdullah Al Mutairi’s comment is true of Nepal football at least for the next few years,"Tuesday, April 19, 2022","On Friday, the head coach of the Nepali men’s football team, Abdullah Al Mutairi, claimed Nepal would not qualify for Asian Cup, stating the country’s football team does not have its base at the grassroots.
There are just two months left for the qualification matches, and on the very first day of special training, the head coach made such a despondent statement. This has definitely created disappointment among the football fraternity.
However, if you analyse the structure of Nepali football and opponents’ status, you know Abdullah Al Mutairi has made a realistic comment, at least for the next few years.
During the event, Abdullah Al Mutairi asked himself “We want to win Asian Cup and  SAF Cup, but are we prepared for it from the basic level?”
Then, he answered, “In the 50 years of history of Nepal football, where are its grassroots?  How concerned is the Nepali football sector to promote young players?”
Unless the country has active age-based teams and regular football competitions, it is irrational to see big dreams, he added.
He raised serious concerns about the effectiveness of grassroots programmes, and the sufficiency of quality football events, adding he wanted to select the players from among 100 to 200 talented footballers for a national team.
Agreeing with Abdullah Al Mutairi’s statement, Sanjeev Mishra, the ANFA league director and football analyst, also admits the country’s football sector lacks a doable plan and its effective implementation for the development of young players.
“It’s not that Nepali football does not have the grassroots. But, its effectiveness is questionable. The effectiveness of regular age-based competition is not seen,” says Mishra.  “It is not easy to reach the national team even for the talented players who already have an identity in the grassroots.”
Mishra considers it a managerial weakness.
According to analyst Mishra, only the efforts by ANFA are not enough to develop football at the grassroots as demanded by coach Abdullah Al Mutairi.
“ANFA is not solely responsible for everything. If we look at the international trend, associations only look after management,” says Mishra. “The district football associations and clubs fall under ANFA. Likewise, A, B and C division clubs should also be active in the growth of football.”
Mishra argues that ANFA, indeed, has done something significant for the growth of grassroots football in Nepal. After ANFA established academies in Kathmandu, Butwal and Dharan in 2012, the grassroots programme was officially introduced in Nepali football. But, internationally, FIFA under its Financial Assistance Programme started providing financial aid for infrastructure, tournaments and grassroots in 1999. After three years, it was renamed a Goal Project.
All three ANFA academies were built under the FIFA aid. The current structure of Sadtobato academy is also a result of that aid, says Mishra. Still now, most of the national players are the products of the ANFA academy.
After Gianni Infantino was appointed as the 2016 FIFA president, he revised the Goal Project and developed it into the FIFA Forward Programme.
After Asian Football Confederation (AFC) made the AFC club licence mandatory for all the A division clubs, Nepal’s A division clubs are currently in the procedure to receive it.
To date, only four clubs–Tribhuvan Army Club, Machhindra Football Club, APF and Manang Marshyangdi Club–have received the licence. The basic criteria to hold an AFC licence is to have own academy and age-based teams. ANFA expects that in the near future, the clubs themselves will run the grassroots programmes and grow age-based football and there will come a time when it will not hear complaints like that of Abdullah Al Mutairi.
As the clubs will be running their own academies, the status of the Nepali football scene is also progressing, according to stakeholders. ANFA in coordination with departmental teams and schools is also conducting weekend programmes for the children aged between 6 to12.
“In every two years, there will be a nationwide selection of u-13 players,” says Karma Tshering Sherpa, the ANFA president tells Onlinekhabar. Just this year, clubs have started training for u-13 players also.
“After forming a team of all ages, we will host a league for the u-15 team.  Likewise, we will also organise the tournament for u-13 and u-18 teams.”
Four years back while being elected as the president of ANFA, Sherpa pledged to give priority to the development of grassroots football. In this regard, in  2018, ANFA conducted a massive nationwide grassroots programme for the first time. Over 16,000 children were trained under the programme. Since then, due to the Covid pandemic, the programme has not continued.
As a result of that programme, in 2018 when the AFC licence holder A division club conducted a player selection programme, it received as many as 900 participants.
Apparently, Abdullah Al Mutairi did not pay attention to these developments in his remark.
Yet, for today, Abdullah Al Mutairi’s comment about a lack of grassroots is right as the national football team is forced to rely on a limited number of players.
When the other remaining club will receive an AFC licence and all the grassroots programmes that were halted due to the pandemic will resume, then only coach Abdullah Al Mutairi will get enough alternatives for the player selection.

2 community football clubs achieve the A division rank. It will inspire players at the grassroots to dream big,"Wednesday, April 13, 2022","On Sunday, Khumaltar Youth Club’s dream came true. They were in tears of joy. The Lalitpur-based B division club were promoted to the A division for the first time in history.  They played the decisive match against Samajik Youth Club at ANFA complex, Satdobato, and won by 2-1 to get promoted.
Likewise, prior to the Khumaltar, last week, Church Boys United also advanced to the A division. The Church Boys played their last match in the league against Bansbari Club and won by 5-1. 888casino login   This made the club stand at top of the list. كازنو
These two clubs have similar stories. Both have a long history and have come from the community level. Their journey to the top division of the national football scene holds the strength to inspire similar community-level institutions to establish themselves nationally.
It was not easy for both the clubs to attain this status. After a lot of hard work and continuous efforts by the club, they made this happen.
It was the club’s fourth attempt to qualify for the A division.
“From the beginning, our main motive was to promote the team.  For that, we tried giving our best every time,” says Mani Raj Bistam, the club’s president.
Out of 13 matches in the recent league, the club won seven matches, lost five and drew one.
The Church Boys even have a more progressive history. Until 2019, they were unranked. Hard work resulted in them getting the C division status that year. The next year, they were in the B division and in 2022, in the A division now.
In the recent league, the club won nine matches, lost two and drew two to score the highest point on the table.
Established in the early 2000s, the Khumaltar were also quickly promoted to the C division, but it took them six long years to get one rank higher. Yet, they did not give up and continued.
If the promotion rules were as same as they are now, the Khumaltar would have been promoted to the A division last year. But, until the last season, there was only one spot, which has been doubled now. beoutq sports
In this journey from qualifying to the C division to A division, four Khumaltar players continuously played impactfully for the team:  Captain Sabin KC, Ashish Sonam, Milan Budathoki, and Anil Khadka.
“Their continuous efforts and presence in the team have helped the club immensely and made this victory possible,” says Bista. “Their participation in the team always gives off positive vibes.”
While Khumaltar credit their success to their continuous efforts, for the Church Boys, it was a strategy.
“We always had a dream to play in ‘A’ Division league, and this time we have finally achieved our dream,” says Reuben Rai, the club president. “In last 12 years, we regularly participated in several events outside the Kathmandu valley and won over 30 titles.”
To achieve the dream, the club made some talented footballers who were not explored by other football clubs play on the field.  Similarly, they also started their training earlier than other clubs.
“We gave chances to some talented footballers who have never played in the A division league,” says Rai.  “Likewise, we immediately started our training after ANFA, the football governing body, issued the notice.”
While other clubs were starting their training session, the team of Church Boys had already got the shape, he adds.
While the Khumaltar are super happy and excited to play in the A division next year, they are also worried about the challenges ahead. The main challenge for them is to manage sufficient funds.
Nonetheless, the club have already started thinking about ways to manage the funds. Bista says, “We have talked to every concerned person about it, and they are positive about it.”
Likewise, they also have a plan to run their own academy as an academy is mandatory to acquire an AFC club licence for an A division club. For that, they have been holding meetings with the concerned bodies since last year.
“We are planning to establish our own academy, and for that, we have already talked with a couple of schools,” says Bista. “We want to proceed ahead by coordinating with them.”
An academy is a key component for upgrading the football scene, he adds.
Similar to the Khumaltar, the Church Boys have also started thinking about running their own academy. As informed by Rai, the club will very soon work on their future plans. For the Church Boys as well, managing adequate capital is the key challenge.
“We expect the help from all our sponsors, supporters and officials of the club,” says Rai.
Meanwhile, Rai says his club also want to give chances to the footballers from outside Kathmandu.
“Many talented footballers are in rural areas,” says Rai. “I want to reach out to them and give them a platform to showcase their skills.”
Rai wants to establish a regional academy somewhere around Ilam, Jhapa and Morang and launch regular training for those talented players from the rural side.

He has witnessed many ups and downs of the Nepali men’s senior cricket team in the last five years while being a key player in it.  Airee was the vice-captain for the national team for two years (November 2019-December 2021) and has always enjoyed cricket. When he was stripped of the vice-captaincy after a serious row, he felt quite low, perhaps the lowest of the past few years. He almost gave up.
“The mental pressure then was much bigger than we used to have during the matches,” says Airee. “At once, I had thought that this was the end of my career.”
But, wait, never give up. In the recent tri-nation series that Nepal played against Papua New Guinea and Malaysia recently, Dipendra Singh Airee testified to his tattoo with his impressive comeback.
The dispute was initiated after the four players of the team exhibited disappointment in the player’s grading. Following the incident, CAN, the national cricket governing body, took action against all those players.
The cricket governing body removed Gyanendra Malla from the position of the captain and Dipendra Singh Airee from that of the vice-captain. Likewise, along with the duo, they also cancelled the central contract of Sompal Kami and Kamal Singh Airee for six months.
At that time, Dipendra Singh Airee was almost about to quit. Showing the disagreement with CAN’s decision to take action against the players, the other contemporary players also warned of stepping down from the game. But, stakeholders put pressure on the disputing sides to pursue reconciliation. After weeks, both sides withdraw and the dispute ended.
As the date of the T20 World Cup Qualifier was approaching close, the cricketers returned to the closed camp. Airee was not sure about continuing cricket even when he was in the closed camp. But, he had a strong belief that one should give their best on the field while playing for the nation.
“The other young contemporaries like Kushal Bhurtel, Rohit Paudel, and so on who were in support of us had still a long career so for them as well, we decided to continue the game,” says Airee.
Hence, this time, for the tri-nation series, the team decided to play impactfully.
Maybe the positive ego helped them move forward. Bhurtel, Paudel and all others played very well. They played remarkably well in T20 World Cup Qualifiers against UAE and Papua New Guinea. Similarly, they also did very well in their homeland during the tri-nation series against Malaysia and PNG.
Kamal Singh Airee did impactful bowling whereas Rohit Paudel, Kushal Bhurtel, and Dipendra Singh Airee celebrated their first centuries in the recent event. Dipendra Singh Airee’s performance during the tri-nation T20 series took Nepal to win the series.
Likewise, in the event, he completed 1000 runs in T20 international matches. He scored 1,033 runs in 39 matches and 34 innings.  Prior to Airee, no other Nepali cricketers had done so.
Dipendra Singh Airee, who made his debut in 2017 during ICC World Cup League Championship against Kenya is now the senior member of the team. In the latest tri-nation series, as the former captain Gyanendra Malla and Binod Bhandari were not in the team, the Nepali team entirely relied on youngsters.
Captain Sandeep Lamichhane, Sompal Kami, and Dipendra Singh Airee were in charge of looking over the team of youngsters. Airee successfully justified his role. He was named the player of the series.
Now, Airee has moved on from the dispute and is committed to giving the best in all the upcoming matches.
Meanwhile, the tattoo on his right arm lists the dates of the milestones of his cricket career. Airee says he wants to add one more row there–with the date when Nepal will qualify for the World Cup. Airee knows his role in that journey because the list tattooed is titled ‘If not now, when?’
Every time Dipendra Singh Airee enters the playing field, he looks at both of his arms and makes himself ready to not disappoint the resolutions.

Supreme Court scraps Ramesh Silwal’s petition to let Tanka Lal Ghising lead the NSC,"Wednesday, April 6, 2022","Kathmandu, April 6
National Sports Council‘s Member-Secretary Tanka Lal Ghising has returned to his office after four months, on Wednesday.
Ghising was barred from working by an interim order issued by the Supreme Court in December 2021. However, the court on Tuesday scrapped the writ petition filed by Ghising’s predecessor Ramesh Silwal that had resulted in the interim order.
The government had removed Silwal from the position in October 2021. After a month, it had appointed Tanka Lal Ghising to the position.
But, expressing his dissatisfaction with the decision, Silwal had moved the apex court. In response to that, a single bench of Justice Hari Phuyal made issued the interim order barring Ghising from work.
But, a division bench of justices Anil Kumar Sinha and Kumar Regmi scrapped Silwal’s appeal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tanka-lal-ghising-back-nsc.html,sports
Rashila Maharjan: Nepal’s 17-year-old shuttler’s Olympic medal dream,"Tuesday, April 5, 2022","Rashila Maharjan, a native of Lalitpur, is just 17. But, she has a plethora of experiences and achievements in badminton. Maharjan, who participated in Asian Sports at the age of 13, representing Nepal, is a national champion currently.
In May 2019, during the 8th National Games organised in the Lumbini province,  Maharjan bagged the gold medal in the senior category. Since then, there has not been another national game, making herself the national champion for a longer period.
While people could envy this, Maharjan herself is not satisfied with the national champion title for she has a bigger dream. The dream to earn an Olympic medal looks like a castle in the air as no Nepali player had made it so far, yet Rashila Maharjan says she is committed to it.
Prior to the rise of Rashila Maharjan, the siblings of Sara Devi Tamang and Nangsal Devi Tamang ruled the Nepali women’s badminton for a decade. Maharjan, who got an opportunity to get trained at the Tribhuvan Army Club (TAC) at the age of 9 is currently being trained by Sara Tamang.
In the urban culture, badminton is a popular game. As it requires small space and provides worthy exercise, there are many amateur players. Rashila Maharjan’s father Rajesh Maharjan of Ombahal was one of them. He did not think of making his daughter play badminton. However, he could not do stop her from pursuing her passion.
“Besides studies, I also wanted her to be good in music and dance and even send her to join their classes,” father Maharjan says, “Whatever, she could not detach herself from badminton.”
“Now, I feel proud to be known by my daughter’s name.”
Back then, Birendra Shrestha, a friend of Rajesh Maharjan, was a member of the Nepal Badminton Association. With his help, the nine-year-old girl entered the TAC for training and started her badminton journey.  Currently, she is ranked 19th in singles and seventh in doubles in the Badminton Junior World Rankings. With that, she also holds the fourth rank in Nepal’s senior category and first in the junior category.
Rashila Maharjan started participating in international matches in 2016, and within two years, she got an opportunity to play important games. At the age of 13, in 2018, she participated in Asian Games, held in Indonesia.  In the team games, she played with the Maldives whereas, in doubles, she played with Amita Giri against South Korea.
She won a bronze medal in the team events during the 13th SAF Games organised in Nepal.
Alongside Prince Dahal, who recently topped the World Badminton Federation’s list of men’s juniors, Rashila Maharjan also received an Olympic scholarship through Badminton Asia, the governing body of the badminton sport in Asia.
“This would help me garner international exposure, ” says Maharjan.
She believes she can grow more if she continues playing and winning the international games and doing hard work.
The scholarship that is provided targeting the 2024 Olympics will prioritise the two Nepali players to acquire international training and play competition. Rashila Maharjan wants to make it to the Olympics, utilising this scholarship.
Besides participating, five-and-a-half-foot tall Maharjan aims to bag a medal in Olympics–for the first time in the country’s history–if she gets productive support from everyone.
For that, now, Rashila Maharjan has a plan to mainly focus on the senior single category. Although she is very new to the senior category, she has recently won a gold medal in the nationwide badminton competition held in Bhaktapur.
Previously, Maharjan used to play in the different events of the junior category including single, double and team.
“Playing in a different category has been hard for me, but now, I am planning to put all my efforts into the senior single category only,” she says. “Focusing on one event can help in playing well.”
It is Rashila Maharjan’s eighth year with the departmental team. She is completely a product of TAC.  She was brought up under the mentorship of senior players Amita Giri, Anu Maya Rai and coach Sara Devi Tamang, who is also a former champion.
“The seniors teach me. Their experiences have helped me a lot, as they are also players, they understand me well,” says Maharjan.
But, Rashila Maharjan complains Nepali players are still helpless financially. Once they stop playing, they need to look for alternatives. Those players are compelled to buy kits and gear from the money earned by playing the game.
Earlier, the association used to give shuttles during the training of the national team. But, after the Covid outbreak, they curtailed the facility. The national players are required to train at their personal expense.
“Clothes, shoes and rackets last for a year. Whenever I have money, I buy many shuttles,” says Rashila Maharjan.
“There is no future in badminton, but I don’t want to leave it,” says Maharjan. She believes that no games are given importance in Nepal.
“In a foreign land, one can get a degree just by playing. But in Nepal, we must study. It is hard to study and play parallelly,” the 12th-grader says.
Yet, she says she will continue playing as she wants to earn an Olympic medal for the country.

Krishna Thapa and his dream to develop skiing as a new adventure sport in Nepal,"Sunday, April 3, 2022","The snowy slopes around Mardi Himal saw something very different this year. Usually full of domestic tourists, this winter, it saw a crowd that was there for more than just sightseeing.
Around 25 people were gathered. Some were travel guides while some worked in the mountains. They were there for one thing – learning the basics of skiing at the Great Himalayan Ski Visit from one of the best in the trade, Krishna Thapa.
“It’s good to see people are interested. If done right, skiing can be huge in Nepal because there are so many places it can be done,” says Krishna Thapa, an internationally recognised ski instructor.
Krishna Thapa has been in the skiing trade for over a decade. During this time, he has trained people from the UK and from different parts of Europe. But, now he wants to share what he has learnt with Nepalis as he aims to inspire a new generation of adventure lovers to carry on his legacy in the mountains.
Krishna Thapa says Nepal has so much potential, but the country has not been able to utilise it. “I was fortunate enough to learn from the best and now I want to share what I know with a younger generation of adventure lovers in the country so that Nepal can realise its potential and become a key destination when it comes to skiing in Asia,” says Thapa.
Thapa got into adventure sports when he was part of the British Gurkha. Realising his interest was in adventure sports, the Gurkhas sent him to train. In a few years, he learnt from the best in the trade and came back as a civilian to teach army professionals.
In 2009, he came to Nepal with skis. He knew the potential Nepal had, but during the time, people were not interested.
“I wanted to change people’s mindset and create an environment for skiing. Why? Because I’ve seen in Europe how it helps develop communities.”
Since 2009, whenever Krishna Thapa went trekking in the mountainous regions, he always took his skis with him. People were sceptical and told him it was ambitious of him, but he did not listen to them as he did what he wanted.
“Nepal is the home of eight-thousanders, but rarely do we see Nepalis skiing in the mountains,” he says. “But they carry skis for the foreigners. I want to change this.”
Since Krishna Acharya started, a lot of Nepali climbers have taken up skiing. Vinayak Jaya Malla and Tenji Sherpa were seen skiing around the slopes of Manaslu in January 2021.
“They are my students. It’s good that these young boys are trying to start this. A whole group of mountain guides affiliated with the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association also went to Europe to get training in skiing.”
Nepal’s mountains have long been a destination for adventure lovers. Mountains like Everest, Lhotse, Annapurna, Manaslu and Dhaulagiri have been skied by foreigners since the 1980s. Krishna Thapa says he himself has skied of Dhaulagiri, Manaslu and Makalu and says if promoted well, Nepal could do wonders.
“But, the government isn’t interested. I go to them with proposals, but some officials ask for bribes. Just because I don’t live here, they think they can bully me into paying them for something that will help the country.”
Instead, Krishna Thapa has been doing things on his own, through various grants he receives. Since he started the ski festival, he has trained over 1,000 people and he hopes he can continue to do so.
“I want to leave behind a legacy.”
But, he will need help. Skiing in Asia is in its infant stage. China and Mongolia are spending billions to set up, but in Nepal, no effort has been made.
Krishna Thapa says all that the government needs to do is set up favourable policies and help build infrastructure in areas like Langtang, Manang, and Khumbu.
“All we need are lodges and health posts. These are basic infrastructures that will pull more adventure lovers to Nepal. We should aim to attract the best of the best skiers and snowboarders out there, but they’ll only come if there are infrastructures in place.”
He says one destination ideal for skiing and snowboarding is Mera Peak. The 6,400-metre tall peak has the perfect slopes for training and hosting international level events.
Krishna Thapa says if marketed well, people will come to Nepal only to train for events being held in Europe. Since training at high altitudes is good for the body, this is another thing that the government should be looking at.
“We have so many places that have snow throughout the year. Yes, getting there is not easy, but if we tap into the right market, we have a chance to gain a lot.”
He is certain that Nepal can be a premium adventure destination for people and if people from the west know about it, it will be full of people.
“Kalinchok, Manang and Langtang need development first. But, we can explore many other places.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/krishna-thapa-skiing-nepal.html,sports
Nepal cricket sees a sea change. It has opportunities and challenges within,"Wednesday, March 30, 2022","For a decade, the Nepal cricket sector revolved around Paras Khadka, Gyanendra Malla, Binod Bhandari, Sharad Vesawkar and Basanta Regmi. From playing in the T20 World Cup to receiving an ODI status, these players had an important role.
Khadka has already retired from the team whereas Regmi apparently is living abroad. Vesawkar last played in World Cup Cricket League 2 against Oman in September 2021.  Likewise, Malla seems to be playing as he appeared in a three-nation series of World Cup Cricket league 2, in Dubai on March 22.
But in the ODI series against Papua New Guinea held after the Dubai match, even Malla was also not in the team. He also did not play the matches of the three-nation T20 series currently underway in Kathmandu. This means, for the first time since the mid-2000s, Nepal played without Khadka and his contemporaries. This generational transformation comes with opportunities and challenges for Nepal cricket.
Lately, the former Nepal cricket captain Gyanendra Malla was out of form. Wicketkeeper-batter Bhandari is being irregularly selected in the team. Bhandari was not in the team during the T20 World Cup qualifier held in Oman a month back. But, he played for the team in the recently held World Cup league 2 in UAE.
Now, with the signing off of these two players, there is no one who is in the team in the 2000s.
Now, the Nepal cricket national team is in charge of the youth. The captain of the team for both ODI and T20 formats, Sandeep Lamichane is just 21. In a team announced for the two recent series, Sompal Kami is the most experienced player to play international matches. He played in the T20 World Cup for the first time in 2014. Then, Karan KC and Aarif Sheikh come on the list of senior players. Both of the players made their debut in international matches in 2015.
Based on age, 30-year-old Karan KC is the senior player in the Nepal cricket national team now. After that, 28-year-old Sushan Bhari takes place on the list. Bhari joined the national senior team in 2017. Captain Lamichhane joined the national team in 2016.
Dilip Nath, Anil Shah and Rohit Paudel made their debut in the national team in 2018 whereas Avinash Bohora, Pawan Sharraf and Kushal Malla are members of the 2019 batch.
Currently, Dev Khanal and Aadil Ansari have made their entry into the senior squad. Left-handed batter Dilip Nath and wicketkeeper-batter Anil Shah have returned to the national team after 2018.
In the present squad, there are eight players who made their debut in 2021. Kamal Singh Airee was also added to the team in 2020 only.
Bhim Sarki made his debut in the senior Nepal cricket team during the last game of League 2 against Papua New Guinea in the UAE. He was already included in the squad in 2019 but waited for three years to debut.
This time, different teams have been listed for the ODI and T20 series; seven players have been included in both formats. A total of 23 players have been selected for the national team from two different squads.
Sandeep Lamichane, Aarif Sheikh, Kushal Bhurtel, Sompal Kami, Dipendra Singh Airee, Sagar Dhakal and Kamal Singh Airee are in both ODI and T20 formats.
Anil Shah, Bikram Shob, Sushan Bhari, Rohit Kumar Poudel, Pawa Sharraf, Dev Khanal, Gulshan Jha and Bikram Jha are only in the ODI squad. Whereas, Karan KC, Avinash Bohora, Bibek Yadav, Dilip Nath, Lokesh Bam, Kushal Malla and Aadil Ansari are in the T20 squad.
As no senior players have been selected for the current Nepal cricket squad, young players now have great responsibilities towards the team. However, as of late, most of the players of the current team have been frequently playing for the national team.
“We want to give a rest to senior players and focus on young ones,” says Dipendra Chaudhary, the head of the Nepal cricket team selection committee. “We gave a rest to Malla and Bhandari. Later, we will again call them in the camp.”
“To make a strong bench for the future Nepal cricket we are testing young players,” he adds.
Dev Khanal and Aadil Ansari, the debutant in the national team, have already played for the U-19 national team. Khanal was even captain of the U-19 team. After performing well in the recent matches, both of the players played during the U-19 Asia Cup in December in Dubai.
The contemporaries of these two players in the national team–Kushal Malla, Lokesh Bam and Gulshan Jha–have recently acquired high-performance training in India.
Kushal Malla and Dilip Nath are left-handed batters. Similarly, pace bowler Gulshan Jha is also a left-handed batter while he is a right-handed bowler. Malla and Nath both are in the T 20 team and Jha is in the ODI team.
As the Nepal cricket team are in charge of the younger generation, few players have already shown positive signs in the recently held matches. Rohit Paudel scored a century against Papua New Guinea on Friday. Similarly, another Nepali batter Dipendra Singh Aaire also scored a century against Papua New Guinea on Saturday. It was his first century for Nepal in an ODI match.
Meanwhile, Nepal’s captain and leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane has become the first Nepali cricketer to take 50 wickets in One Day International matches.
Similarly,  Nepal won against Papua New Guinea in the first match of the Three nation T20 series, on Monday at TU cricket ground, Kirtipur. Hosts Nepal won by 15 runs.
But, it does not mean that there are no challenges in front of Nepal cricket. Team captain Lamichhnae and head coach Pubudhu Dassanayake both agree that the team have room for improvement.
“We need to convert the small scores into big ones,” says Lamichane. “We all have been working on it.”
Likewise, Lamichhane also says the team also need to improve balling.
“As all the players in the team are young, we need to improve in various areas,” says Dassanayake after the match on Monday. “For now, the problem is being a team of young ones. The base of the team is being prepared. We are getting ready as a team.”
However, Dassanayake is happy with the overall performance of the team and the potential they hold.

"For blind cricketers in Nepal, the sport is respect, recognition and life","Wednesday, March 23, 2022","Gita Paudel of Rupandehi has been playing cricket for the last 15 years. When Nepal formed the world’s first national cricket team of visually impaired women, she was a member of it. Since then, she has played blind cricket in national and international series.
Durga Acharya of  Surkhet also started playing blind cricket from her school days.
After being selected at the local to the provincial level, she has been playing cricket in the capital for the last five years. Acharya, also a table tennis player, is satisfied with sports.
Two members of Nepal’s women’s blind cricket team–Paudel of the first generation and Acharya of the second–are examples of what a sport can give to people deprived of equal opportunities in several respects in society. Cricket, for them, is respect, recognition and life.
“Along with physical fitness, the sport has also provided us an opportunity to be involved in social interaction,” says Paudel.
“Our unique capability has changed the way of looking at us. It has propelled the people to realise that we can play and do something,” she says, “Our identity has been created in society.”
Paudel played blind cricket against England and Pakistan in 2014 and 2019 respectively.
Nepal’s Cricket Association of the Blind (CAB) is keen to develop blind cricket in both men’s and women’s categories, but it lacks resources. Events are held whenever the association finds sponsors.
Nepal is the first country in the world to officially introduce blind cricket for women and it is played in five other countries.
“The players have learned to live life normally. They have built confidence to realise that even they (despite lacking eyesight) can do something,” says Pawan Ghimire, the CAB president, adding, “They have made friends by playing internationals. The progress attained by those players has made us proud of our efforts.”
After Nepal reached the Men’s Blind Cricket World Cup in 2012, dozens of new-generation blind cricket players began picking the sport as their career.  The founders are happy looking at its popularity.
Durga Acharya of Surkhet also decided to make her future in cricket by looking at Nepal’s progress. Although she used to play it since her school years, she began playing it regularly in the last five years.
“Sports teaches us discipline and team chemistry, and it also makes you physically and mentally strong,” says Acharya.
She is happy to gain both recognition and respect from cricket.
“If I had not been associated with this game, nobody would have known me. You and I, we both wouldn’t have met,” she says. “I have earned an identity and respect among friends and society after becoming a sportsperson.”
Bharat Chaulagain of Nepalgunj, who has played in the men’s world cup of blind cricket, echoes Acharya.
“Cricket has changed the perception of life,” says Chaulagain, also a political science student at the Tribhuvan University.

Pawan Ghimire introduced blind cricket in Nepal in the mid-2000s.  In the initial phase, he faced enormous challenges but with continuous efforts, things have changed now.
“It was very hard to make visually impaired people play with a ball and bat,” Ghimire says. “We also didn’t have any financial support, so we spent all the money from our own earnings.”
Ghimire and his team searched hard for potential players. To retain them, they initially provided an allowance from their own pocket. With four bats and 20 balls provided by Pakistan, their journey began.
With the span of time and continuous efforts, they gradually overcome the challenges. The men’s team even played the World Cup matches and won against developed nations like New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. No World Cup event has been held in the women’s category in blind cricket so far.
“Our success has proved that we can do anything if the opportunity is given,” says Ghimire.
Ghimire is a two-time vice-president and two-time treasurer of the World Blind Cricket Council and two-time director for the Asian region. This shows that the Cricket Association of Blind-Nepal is well recognised globally.
The association now has a plan to organise a World Cup in Nepal.
“We want to develop this sport from the grassroots level,” says Ghimire. “We are also planning to reach all seven provinces to explore players who could perform well in the World Cup.”
With that, the association also wants to organise international tournaments for women in Nepal.

Futsal culture disperses across Nepal. Sports enthusiasts are happy and hopeful,"Monday, March 21, 2022","Jumla Futsal and Karnali Hub, a futsal court based in Jumla in the Karnali province, gets busy and reserved almost every day, especially during mornings and evenings.
The number of futsal players is increasing there. From school-going children to workers, everyone is playing futsal in the Jumla district headquarters, a mountainous district in Nepal.
The court’s owner Prakash Shahi says the futsal culture in this faraway district got popular quite quickly. “Many people are avidly enjoying it.”
Lately, the futsal culture is getting more popular notably and as a result, the number of futsal grounds is also growing. From the young kids to the guys (and girls in their 20s) and from the mid-agers to the elderly, people are seen dribbling the ball on futsal grounds.
It has been already some years since futsal has become one of the most happening phenomena in Kathmandu. But, lately, the futsal culture is growing in different cities and even some underdeveloped towns of the country also.
So what does this mean to the development of sports in Nepal?
Bivek Dhungel, 24, of Bhaktapur, goes to a futsal ground near his college with his friends and neighbours almost daily. As there is less space to play football around the place he resides, Dhungel says futsal is the only option.
“Earlier, there were sufficient grounds to play football near my home, but now, things have changed. Almost all of those open spaces are shrunk now,” says Dhungel.
There are many others like Dhungel who go to futsal regularly. To some extent, it quenches their thirst for playing football on the spacious ground.
Raj Maharjan, the president of Nepal Futsal Commercial Association and also the owner of Dhuku Futsal Hub, accepts that the acceptance of futsal culture is growing rapidly each day. He identifies different reasons behind it.
“For those who are health conscious and want to stay fit, futsal has become their favourite spot,” says Maharjan. “Similarly, futsal venues are better managed than the existing open football grounds, making people feel like going there.”
Maharjan has seen everyone from school students to jobholders and retired individuals loving the futsal culture.
It is a happening sport and not much complicated. Likewise, the futsal goes uninterrupted whether it is a hot season, rainy or cold outside, he adds.
Nepal saw a futsal arena for the first time in 2011, Nawang Nima Lama introduced it. Back then, Lama was already sure that the futsal culture would grow largely in Nepal.
“Nepali people are emotionally very much attached to football, which is why people here largely prefer to go for futsal,” says Lama. “Likewise, less availability of proper football ground is also prompting people to go to futsal.”
“With the passing of time, the futsal culture will grow even larger.”
Lately, the futsal culture is dispersing outside the Kathmandu valley as well. As informed by Maharjan, even in the far-flung areas like Sankhuwasabha, Jumla and Surkhet, several futsal courts are being made.
Pratik Palikhey, the owner of Itahari-based Sports Arena is surprised how his business got popular over the past few years.
“Although there are many open spaces around Itahari, the futsal culture is increasing notably,” says Palikhey. He also informs Itahari’s neighbour Dharan has also witnessed a similar trend.
Shahi and Palikhey both believe that the futsal culture in their places will grow to the next level in the upcoming years. They also hope their places will be able to produce a number of good futsal players soon.
There are over 300 futsal courts in Nepal and around 200 of them are inside the valley. Reportedly, in 2019 there were only around 120 futsal arenas within the valley.
Following Kathmandu, Dharan, Pokhara and Jhapa are also crazy about the futsal culture.
“It will take an investment of Rs 5 million to 10 million to build a futsal court,” says Maharjan. “On average, one futsal court earns Rs 5,000 to 10,000 per day.”
With that, the number of futsal tournaments is taking place in good numbers. From educational institutions to corporate houses and local communities, all of them are seen frequently organising futsal tournaments and matches.
In September, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the national football governing body, in coordination with ANFA Futsal Committee organised the first edition of  ‘A’ Division Futsal League.
Sports Castle Pokhara won the league and took home a cash prize of Rs 1 million while the runners-up Sankhamul acquired Rs 500,000.
Binod Gurung, the coordinator of the ANFA Futsal Committee, informs his committee will continue actively working for the development of the futsal culture in Nepal. In addition, ANFA is also preparing to form the national futsal team, according to him.
“Now, we are preparing for the AFC Qualifiers taking place in Kyrgyzstan in April. We are putting our best effort into it,” says Gurung.
“With that, we are also going to provide the training of level one to 20 coaches, and an international instructor is coming to Nepal for it.”
It means every interested individual in any part of the country will have an opportunity to score a goal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/futsal-culture-grows-across-nepal.html,sports
Fencing in Nepal: Too many problems prevent the sport from its growth,"Friday, March 11, 2022","The atmosphere around the covered hall beside the Dasharath Stadium is different. The hall is usually full of people who go there to witness sports like basketball, volleyball and badminton. But this past week, it is been anything but full.
Despite that, there is energy in the hall as Nepal’s best fencers go head to head in the Bir Ganesh Man Singh Memorial National Fencing Championship, one of the key events of fencing in Nepal.
Even though fencing entered the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, its presence in Nepal is very sombre. Fencing in Nepal does have an association and a few players, but a lack of regular tournaments has halted its progress in the country.
Fencing originated in Greece and has been part of the summer Olympics since 1896. But, only five national-level tournaments have taken place in fencing in Nepal to date. This is mostly due to the Nepal Fencing Association that was formed just in 2009.
Following the formation of the association, the sport was included in the National Games for the first time in 2012. Things were looking great for the players following this as they got to take part in the Asian Games in Korea and Indonesia respectively. The South Asian Games in 2019 had also included fencing for the first time.
Nepali teams have also been going to other international fencing tournaments like the world championship, Asian championship and South Asian championship. Despite this, fencing in Nepal is not considered a mainstream sport.
But, the association has not lost its hope.
“We know things don’t look great, but we are one of the youngest fencing associations in the world and I think it will take time to establish fencing in Nepal,” says Sujan Lal Shrestha, the association’s general secretary.
He understands that the sport is in a delicate stage as previous players have left the country and Shrestha fears more will follow suit.
“Even though this falls under martial arts, this is not a cheap sport to be associated with,” says Shrestha. “We don’t have the financial backing needed to help us get to where we want to be.”
To even start fencing in Nepal, one will have to fork out up to Rs 300,000 for the equipment. And with not enough domestic competition, it has become hard to keep players interested in the sport, says Shrestha.
One player that stayed is Omkar Singh. Singh says those that are in fencing in Nepal currently are in it because of their love for it. He says these people do not care about what they will get from the sport.
“All we want is to lay the foundation for a niche sport in the country,” says Singh, urging the government to set aside a budget and bring a plan to promote the sport.
Singh says it has already been too late to develop fencing in Nepal which could have been included in school curriculums. But, he understands that these things do not happen overnight. But, what makes him sad is how the Fencing Association has not been able to conduct tournaments.
“I started fencing when I was at Shivapuri School. I think everyone here in this competition is from the same school. If we take this to the schools, the sport will gain traction and we might see kids as young as 20 take part in international tournaments,” says Singh.
Shrestha says that the association has discussed developing a plan to promote fencing in schools, adding the Olympic Committee is on board with the committee.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fencing-in-nepal-problems.html,sports
Anjila Tumbapo Subba: A youthful promise to change football into everyone’s sport in Nepal,"Thursday, March 10, 2022","Anjila Tumbapo Subba has been the goalkeeper of Nepal’s women’s football team for the past eight years. During her career, she and her teammates have spent as much time training as their male counterparts, but she feels that their team do not get the recognition it deserves.
“When we talk about the national football team, people always think about the men’s team,” she says. “This has resulted in people also not caring about us. That’s wrong.”
It is wrong because these women have worked hard and sacrificed even more than men to get where they are. Take Anjila Tumbapo Subba for example. By the age of 24, she has established herself as the country’s number one goalkeeper. “Now, I want to change the perception prevalent in Nepal that football means men’s football.”
But, to get to this position and have developed a determination to change the scene, she has had to face quite a hard time travelling from her home in Kanyam to the capital city Kathmandu.
Anjila Tumbapo Subba was born in Panchthar. As a girl born in rural Nepal, she had to face adversities from an early age. Her father abandoned their family, after which her mother remarried and moved to Kanyam in Ilam.
That is where her love for the game started. Close to her house was a football ground where her stepbrothers and sisters played football. Wanting to fit in, she also started to join in.
Watching her play football, people were not happy as they constantly complained to Subba’s mother telling her her daughter would ruin her life.
“Thankfully, my mother was supportive and encouraged me to play. Without her and the family’s support, I would not be here.”
Yet, it was not easy. Even though Anjila Tumbapo Subba loved the game, she did not even have football boots nor did she have a ball. Not letting that discourage her, she continued working hard. As she started to play district level tournaments, she started to get the funds to buy boots.
Subba was not always a goalkeeper. while playing in Kanyam Once when her team’s keeper did not come to a match, Subba stepped up. She had never kept the goal before but that time, she surprisingly did better than even the goalkeeper of the team.
“I had one goal to stop them from scoring and I did that. Everyone was so happy with my performance,” says Subba.
Soon Anjila Tumbapo Subba understood that a goalkeeper was a specialist position that no one really wanted. But, as she learnt being a keeper would mean better chances, she continued to train and get better.
It was in 2012, during the sixth national games, that she started to make a name for herself nationally, impressing everyone playing for Eastern Nepal.
That caught the eyes of selectors who kept on monitoring her. During the eighth national games, her determination to keep a clean sheet was lauded by everyone.
“After the sixth national games, I started getting phone calls. People started to tell my parents that they’d pay for my education and give me a place to live in Kathmandu.”
Anjila Tumbapo Subba was only 14 then.
But, as the Armed Police Force came calling, her parents could not say no. It was with the force that she learnt the basics of goalkeeping and started to improve. Soon, she was the team’s starting goalkeeper.
Last year, she even went to Pakistan to play in the woman’s league there alongside three other Nepali women. Playing for Masha United, she even captained the team. But, the tournament was cancelled midway due to elections and the outbreak of Covid-19.
Back to Nepal again, Anjila Tumbapo Subba is desperate to change people’s perception about women’s football as this has been her goal now.
In Nepal, like everywhere in the world, men’s football gets a lot of coverage and importance. Stadiums are full of fans who want to see the country win. But, when it comes to women’s football, the same enthusiasm is not there.
It is not just about the fans, even the governing body, ANFA, does not pay much attention to improving the women’s team. It knows if it spends the same amount of energy and resources on the women’s team, there is a chance to win something big, but due to various reasons, it does not seem keen, complaints Anjila Tumbapo Subba.
Nepal’s women’s team are ranked 103rd in the world compared to the men’s which are ranked at 167. Despite this, the women’s team hardly go abroad to take part in tournaments as their competitions are limited to Nepal.
“When we ask why we don’t have many games, they tell us they don’t have the budget. It discouraging that the state says that,” says Subba.
When Karma Tsering Sherpa became ANFA president, he had told everyone how he would change this. But, even during his term, little to nothing has happened, complains Anjila Tumbapo Subba. He had promised to start an academy dedicated to women, but even that promise has not materialised along with his promise of extending the women’s league season.
Subba says she will continue pushing for this parity as long as she plays football.
In her stay in Pakistan, Anjila Tumbapo Subba learnt about life more than she did about football as she saw the Pakistani women live life in a country dominated by men shocked her.
“I know women aren’t treated as equals, but in Pakistan, things were different. They didn’t even let women wear short clothes. We had to play wearing full clothes.”
That’s made her even more goal-oriented as she wants to do a lot in the field.
It is safe to say that Anjila Tumbapo Subba’s life has been turned on its head now as a biopic based on her life is under work where she herself will be cast as the lead of the film.
“Everyone has their own struggles in life. Maybe they liked my struggle more than they did others. I feel that I am getting to relive my life all over again. I hope I do myself justice and show the struggles I’ve been through,” she says, adding she hopes to inspire women from all walks of life.
This year, she is also nominated for the NSJF’s People Choice Award. She hopes that the award will help women’s football gain some traction among football fans in Nepal.
“I feel proud to have been included in this list.”
Anjila Tumbapo Subba hopes that she can continue her life in football even after she is done playing. Her goal, she says, is to become a goalkeeping coach.
“I know nothing apart from football. This is my life and I hope to carry on.”

"With no inter-generational transformation, Nepal’s traditional local games are dying","Sunday, March 6, 2022","Whether it is playing with clay toys and clay money or making telephones out of matchboxes joined with a thread: the ‘90s kids have a lot of memories of playing various traditional local games. Your childhood had everything, it was when paper boats trod water while paper planes reached new heights in the air.
The traditional local games that you played in childhood were environment-friendly, economic and used local resources. Many of these local games were played as per the seasons while a few games were played in any season.
But today, with the penetration of technology, children in urban and rural areas have stopped playing such physical games. They are more into online games like Free Fire and PUBG, robbing people of the collective feeling.
Many physical sports have disappeared in the last three decades and many other local games are endangered. When Sharad Chandra Shah was the member secretary of the National Sports Council in the 1970s, a committee was formed to search for local games and collect data from across the country. The committee discussed which games could be taken to the national and international levels. Besides that, no serious efforts have been made to preserve local games.
But among all, there are many games that people play in different parts of Nepal.
A few of the local games popular among the ‘90s kids are:
Guchcha is a traditional local game played originally in rural Nepal. With time, the way it is played has also changed. It is played by measuring a length from the thumb to the little finger, tossing, bouncing, matching, guessing, et cetera. The most common rule is that the loser pays up the winner.
The marble-spoon race is a kind of traditional local game, in which a participant walks down the course with a marble on the spoon. All participants put a spoon with marble in their mouths. The person who reaches the furthest while biting a spoon without the marble falling off wins the game.
It is a traditional local game played in a group of children in rural Nepal, especially while grazing cattle. To play the game, you need to dig a hole in the ground. Players try to throw and aim either a marble, a coin or a flat stone in the hole from a distance. The one who lands them in the hole wins the game.
This traditional local game is usually played in an open field of rural Nepal. There is a 5×5 grid where small and big stones, to represent 20 goats and four tigers, move along the intersections. In the game, the tiger tries to eat the goat given that the intersection ahead is empty. Meanwhile, the goat tries to trap the tiger by encircling it from all sides.
When the tiger eats the goat, the stone is removed from the board while the remaining stones continue to trap the tiger. If a tiger eats six goats, it is considered to have won the game.
Dandibiyo is another game played in rural Nepal. The game uses a two-foot wooden stick (dandi) and another six-inch wooden stick (biyo). The dandi has a slanted side while the biyo is sharpened on both sides. The biyo is placed horizontally in a hole that is about four-inch long and two-inch deep. There is no limited number of players nor is the size of the playing field fixed.
Before volleyball was declared the national sport, dandibiyo and kabaddi were “unofficially” considered national games. In India, dandbiyo is known as gilli danda.
Similar local games named pandhunge, lakkudhal, and kinwal are interesting; the names vary from place to place depending on where they are played.
In this game, five or six stones are kept on top of each other and are struck by a ball from a certain distance. Depending on where the ball rests, the player has to hit the stones from there. If the players who are putting the stones together are hit by a ball from the opponent team, they will be out of the game. If they put together the stones without getting hit, they will win.
As a tool of the traditional local game, a ghurra originally used to be made of wood. With time, the concept was later used in chocolates that had a thread in the middle which people could twist and play and eat later.
Gir is played on empty fields, especially after harvesting crops. Girs are made by cutting slippers or wood into round shapes. It is struck with a stick and carried across. Just like in football, when one tries and gets the piece to the other side, one wins the game.
Hide the handkerchief is a traditional local game still played in various events and programmes. In the game, the players stay inside a circle, facing inwards, and one person walks around in the circle behind their backs. The person hides a handkerchief behind another person. Other persons have to find out if the handkerchief is behind them or not. If the person does not find out on time, the one who hid the handkerchief beats him/her with the same.
Cockfighting is also a game with two or more players. In the game, the participant raises one leg and holds it with their hand. People have to play the game in the same position. But, as it is difficult to stand for long, the one who fights till the end wins the game.
Phirphire is a childhood game played by an individual. A paper or dried bamboo sheet is made as identical leaves where the ends are attached to a stick to make a phirphire or pinwheel. Children run around in the field during March/April when the wind blows.
A tug-of-war is another popular traditional local game played by two groups. In the game, both the groups pull on the rope to their sides. The team that pulls the other group towards them is the winner.
Khutti is a traditional local game in which a small piece of stone cut in a circular way. Here, one lifts their one leg up and hits the stone with the other foot. According to the rules, a line is drawn on the floor and the person has to take the stone without touching that line.
Gatta is still played by some today, especially by teenage girls. It can be played forever. The players, either two or more and in groups, play it with five, seven or nine stones in their hands.
This traditional local game is played by groups as lukidum or hide-and-seek. In it, a person is picked to find others and that person is called a ‘dum’. After a certain countdown, everyone should be done hiding, and they have to search for others. If others touch the person before they see them, they have to start over.
In this childhood game, a pot is hung in the middle and participants are blindfolded to break the pot with a stick. The one who can smash the pot wins. This game is popular among people during picnics or gatherings.
This traditional local game is popular in the Kaski and Lamjung districts of western Nepal. It is said that this game is more than two centuries old. In the game, a stone is chosen and thrown away far from a certain point. The one who can throw the stone the farthest wins the game. At present, the government is organising various programmes for its promotion.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-traditional-local-games-dying.html,sports
T20 World Cup Qualifiers: Nepal beat Oman by 39 runs,"Friday, February 18, 2022","Kathmandu, February 18
Beating Oman by 39 runs in the first match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Qualifiers, Nepal have started the tournament off with a bang at the Al Amerat Cricket Ground in Al Amerat.
Winning the toss, Oman put Nepal into bat, a decision which proved to be right as Nepali batters struggled to get going. Bilal Khan got Aasif Sheikh in the first over of the match while Kushal Bhurtel did not last long either. Wickets kept falling at regular intervals with only Aarif Sheikh making a notable score of 38 helping Nepal to a modest total of 117.
Oman bowlers were impressive with their line and length. Kaleemullah, Oman’s medium pacer was particularly good even though he did not pick up any wicket.
Chasing 118, Oman struggled a lot from the get-go. They lost Kashyap Prajapati in the first over to Kamal Singh Airee and Ayaan Khan in the second over to Jitendra Mukhiya, after which they started to bat sensibly. But when Jatindar Sigh was run out by Dipendra Singh Airee in the sixth over, things started to look better for Nepal.
Nepali bowlers gave nothing to the Omanis as they kept chipping away with wickets in crucial times thanks to spinners Sandeep Lamichhane and Dipendra Singh Airee who reduced Oman to 35 for six.
Naseem Kushi, who hit two sixes of Lamichhane, was looking the only threat to Nepal but when he was bowled by the Nepali captain, the game was all but over. Kamal Singh Airee came back and finished off the tail in the 17th over as Oman were all out for only 78 runs.
With this win, Nepal have a chance to finish as group winners if they manage to beat Canada and the Philippines.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/t20-world-cup-qualifiers-nepal-oman.html,sports

"CAN withdraws action taken against 4 cricketers, inducts them into the central contract","Friday, January 28, 2022","Kathmandu, January 28
Nepal’s cricket governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), has withdrawn action against four cricketers including former captain Gyanendra Malla.
Whereas the cricket board had decided not to sign any contract with Malla, former deputy captain Dipendra Singh Airee, and two key players Sompal Kami and Kamal Singh Airee, a board meeting held on Thursday withdrew the decision, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Following the withdrawal, CAN has put Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee and Kami in category A whereas Kamal Singh Airee has been placed in category C.
These four had expressed their dissatisfaction over the categorisation of national team members, igniting a grave crisis in Nepal cricket. Following that, the national cricket board had decided to cancel their central contract for the first half of 2022. The board had also removed Gyanendra Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee as the captain and vice-captain respectively.
The board itself was divided about the action as some board members expressed their dissatisfaction publicly.
Following that, around 10 other players had also boycotted the closed camp called by the reappointed coach Pubudu Dassanayake.

APF beat NPC by 21 runs to win PM Cup 2022,"Wednesday, January 19, 2022","Kathmandu, January 19
The Armed Police Force (APF Club) have beaten Nepal Police Club (NPC) by 21 runs in the final of the Prime Minister Cup (PM Cup) held at the TU Cricket Ground on Wednesday.
The APF, who had been put into bat by NPC, scored 157 in their innings with Amar Routela top-scoring with 29 runs. Routela’s innings came in handy for the APF who struggled to get going despite Lokesh Bam and Sundeep Jora getting starts.

In reply, the NPC struggled from the start as they lost the opener, Pawan Sarraf, in the first ball of the innings. Even though Airee played handy innings of 65, he did not get the support he needed as the NPC’s bowlers Kishore Mahato, Abinash Bohora and Amar Routela continued to pick up wickets at regular intervals. Ultimately, the APF won the match by 21 runs.

"Dasharath Stadium, Nepal’s only int’l football venue, is plagued with super-basic problems for years","Wednesday, January 12, 2022","On a cold winter morning, Surendra Rai along with three others are at the Dasharath Stadium watering the ground that over the past week has held five A-Division League matches.
As it is winter, there is hardly any grass in the field which also needs patching up from the battering it has taken over the course of the past week. The workers usually have three days to make the ground ready for another round of fixtures and they know that they will need to work round the clock to ensure that the pitch is safe for playing.
“It’s hard honest work,” says Rai. “We don’t have enough human resources, but we do what we can do because as they say, the show must go on.”
Dasharath Stadium is the country’s only international stadium that can host a football game, but its state is quite bad. While the stadium did receive a makeover after the 2015 earthquake, the ground is still the same as it was over two decades ago.
In September 2021, Nepal hosted India in two friendly matches, after which Indian football analysts and their coach criticised the pitch for being too slow. They said the wobbly pitch of Dasharath Stadium was not fit enough to host international football matches as it raised the risk of the players being injured. But, why is this the case? Who is responsible for the state of the ground? Well, the answer to this question is not simple.
The stadium was built in 1956 and has had some renovation from time to time. Its first renovation came in 1998 just before Nepal was due to host the South Asian Games in 1999. That was when the football pitch was changed too and since then, it has hosted various football matches, concerts and other events. Since then, the stadium has been renovated a few more times, but the pitch has not and that players and other stakeholders say is wrong on many levels.
“When we played in Kuwait, it felt odd playing on such a good surface. It took us time to get acquainted with the surface because the ones here are so bad,” a national team player told Onlinekhabar on the condition of anonymity.
Even coaches from football clubs have started to raise questions regarding the pitch. After Himalayan Sherpa beat Satdobato Youth Club, Yug Kishore Rai, Sherpa’s coach, criticised the Dasharath Stadium pitch stating that it was not up to standard.
“The pitch is horrible. We can’t be expected to play good football on such a pitch,” he said. “We need to look at playing games in other grounds too, conducting five games a week on the same pitch because all clubs have invested a lot of money on players and we don’t want them to get hurt.”
As the grass density is low, the ground staff cannot even water the ground as much as they want to. That results in the performance of players.
They also do not have the proper equipment to maintain the pitch nor do they have the skills required. What is worse is the Dasharath Stadium ground only has two permanent staff members, out of whom only one, Dilip Rajak, the head ground staffer, is trained in skills for ground management.
Onlinekhabar’s repeated attempts to meet or talk to Rajak were unsuccessful.
Everyone involved in football in Nepal knows that the turf at Dasharath Stadium needs to be replaced. Even though there have been talks of replacing the old turf, not much has been done. While the turf was okay two decades ago, in today’s age, the turf is as bad as it can get.
“It needs replacing and we’ve been talking to ANFA (All Nepal Football Association) and NSC (National Sports Council) about this, but there have been no inroads yet,” says Rai.
He says the staff are doing everything in their power to ensure that the field is good enough to play on, but external forces make it hard for them to work smoothly.
“The NSC rents out the field for different purposes which makes it hard for us to manage it,” says Rai.
He says the ground was in good shape until the match against India. Even though it was wobbly, the ground had a lot of grass. But, post the two friendlies, the NSC rented out the ground for the Mayor Cup Veterans’ Football Tournament, which held around four games a day for a week.
“That ruined the ground,” says Rai.
The Dasharath Stadium ground is not owned by the Nepali football governing body ANFA and that makes it tricky. If ANFA wants the ground, it has to ask the Nationals Sports Council for permission. While the NSC says it has tried its best to keep the ground playable, it is clear that it needs to do more.
“We want to ensure that the ground is good, but with so many games we can’t do what we want,” says Kul Bahadur Thapa, the NSC’s spokesperson.  “It’s winter and with five matches taking place every week, it’s obvious that the ground looks bad.”
He says the council had repaired the Dasharath Stadium pitch during the 2019 South Asian Games and says the ground is okay and does not need to be replaced.
“The ground is fine, if it wasn’t, we wouldn’t be able to host the South Asian Games there,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dasharath-stadium-ground-problems.html,sports
PM Cup to begin today,"Monday, January 10, 2022","Kathmandu, January 10
The fifth edition of the Prime Minister’s Cup (PM Cup) is taking place at the Tribhuvan University cricket ground from Monday. The tournament is being organised by the Cricket Association of Nepal with help from the National Sports Council.
The tournament, this year, is going to be a bit different as the organisers have decided to scrap the ODI format and replace it with T20 so that the players prepare for the forthcoming T20 Qualifiers that will be held in Oman in February.
CAN believes that this will be a fair opportunity for all players to get into the team based on merit. Prior to this tournament, Nepal’s head coach, Pubudu Dassanayake, had already called up 30 players for training.
Nepal’s newly-appointed captain, Sandeep Lamichhane, however, will miss the PM Cup as he is currently in Australia taking part in the Big Bash League.
A total of 10 teams will take part in the tournament that will take place in TU Cricket Ground and Mulapani Cricket Ground. The teams have been divided in two groups of five where the top two teams of each group will qualify for the semi-finals.
The final will take place on January 19.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/pm-cup-to-begin-from-today.html,sports

"Dhurmus, Suntali pull out of cricket stadium project; Bharatpur city likely to take over","Tuesday, December 21, 2021","Chitwan, December 21
Celebrated comedians Sitaram Kattel ‘Dhurmus’ and Kunjana Ghimire ‘Suntali’ have decided to pull out of an ambitious project to construct a cricket stadium in Bharatpur of Chitwan that they had initiated three years ago.
Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was pushed into limbo as the donors who had committed funds to the actors-turned-philanthropists did not keep the promises.
Now, the couple have requested the Bharatpur metropolitan city to take over the ownership. Earlier, the duo’s Dhurmus Suntali Foundation had signed an agreement with the city government that mentions if the foundation cannot generate funds, it could hand over the ownership.
Bharatpur Mayor Renu Dahal says she is committed to continuing the cricket stadium project and is consulting the federal Youth Ministry in this regard. She says if the federal government is okay with the plan, the city government is ready to take over.
It has been learned that the Dhurmus Suntali Foundation is yet to pay Rs 170 million in loans. The project has spent Rs 546 million whereas its estimated budget is Rs 3 billion.

Nepal cricket is in trouble again as key players bat their discontent at CAN,"Tuesday, December 7, 2021","There was a buoyant mood at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Sunday as Lumbini U-19 beat Sudurpaschim U-19 to be crowned the U-19 National Champions. But, the mood soon turned grim as Chatur Bahadur Chand, the president of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) started to speak.
“You are the future of Nepali cricket. However, you will only be successful if you balance hard work and discipline. If you don’t have discipline, you have no future in cricket,” he said to the recently crowned champions and others present there.
He emphasised the word ‘discipline’ a lot during his speech. He even went on to say how some former and current players were showing a lack of it by speaking ill about the CAN and its leadership in the media.
“The association led by Chatur Bahadur Chand will not compromise with a lack of discipline,” he reiterated.
Nepal’s cricket is in problem again. The dispute between CAN, the national cricket board, and players has reached a tipping point with both parties blaming each other. What first started after the cricket governing body announced central contracts to players based on three categories has been built up to an extent where many are questioning if there is any way back from this.
The dispute started after CAN on October 6 released a list of male and female cricketers who had received central contracts for a period from April to December. The list had three categories, all having different salaries.
This did not go down well with some players. Four senior players including captain Gyanendra Malla publically voiced their opinion against CAN and questioned on what basis did they divided the players into different categories. This, however, did not go down well with CAN, which then asked for clarification from the players. In reply, the players have submitted their response and even written a letter to the association, asking it to address 11 demands.
The players are upset because a committee led by former CAN vice-president Raju Babu Shrestha had prepared contract criteria and prepared a list in July. But, that list was not endorsed until October.
The committee had also stated it would review the list based on the performance of players every six months. But, when CAN made the list public, it did not do that. Rather, it prepared the list for nine months (April to December). This, the players say, is quite unfair on players who have performed quite well in the past six months.
CAN says it prepared the list based on the players’ performance in three international series. The first was the fifth round of the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 when Nepal took on the USA and Oman in Nepal, the other was the ACC Eastern Region T20 qualifiers held in Thailand, and the last was the tri-nation T20 series against the Netherlands and Malaysia held in Nepal.
But, the players say they do not believe the categorisation is fair. Speaking on behalf of players, captain Malla, vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee, Sompal Kami and Kamal Singh Airee say this was unfair on players who made a comeback and played well in the tri-series held in Oman in September 2021.
The four players have since refused to sign the central contract and vented out their frustration to the media and on social media as well. CAN has not liked that, and on November 11, CAN asked them for a formal clarification. CAN says speaking out in the media in the manner that they did was against CAN’s statute and asked for a reply within seven days.
By November 16, all four players submitted their reply to the association, stating the categorisation was faulty. A few days later, captain Malla spoke to CAN’s acting secretary Prashant Malla who had ensured the captain that they would talk and solve this dispute.
But, the talk did not happen. The players wrote to CAN again on November 21. This time, they asked CAN fulfil their demands. The demands stated that the captain and vice-caption be involved while making such a list. Along with that, they also asked for clarification why the $50 per match stipend was cut down to $35 per match. They also wanted to know why they were not getting match fees and why they were not insured. They also questioned CAN about why the cricket team had never received cash prizes like the football team had.
They also demanded the CAN appoint a national team coach as soon as possible and complained that the physio was not treating players correctly.
After this, CAN called a meeting with the players on November 25, telling them it would answer their queries in person. But, on November 28, the cricket governing body asked for clarification from the players again. Along with that, it also asked players who had not signed the central contract to explain why, by December 1. In reply, the players said the same thing they had always said: the categorisation was faulty and that it needed amendment.
As all of this is happening, acting secretary Prashant Malla says a few players do not want to accept that CAN exists. Agreeing that there is tension between the board and the players, he says players needed to act better. He says that since reinstatement, CAN has been handing out match fees, paying salaries to both men and women cricketers, and has conducted tournaments even in the midst of a pandemic.
“Yet, they don’t give us any credit,” says Prashant Malla.
He accuses players of trying to threaten CAN. “Despite that, we still want to hold dialogue with them,” he says. “But, still they haven’t signed the contract.”
He says the association has been monitoring the activities of these players and adds that most of them lack discipline.
The official also adds the contracts have to be signed by December 15 because it will have to send the ICC the detail about expenses done by CAN in 2021.
“Sompal isn’t included in Category A and that hasn’t gone down well with him,” says Malla. “But, he’s only played one tournament. We have certain criteria for how these players are categorised. We can’t go against that.”
He says if players are satisfied with the contract, they can refuse to take salaries. But, the official says CAN strongly condemns the groupsim that is happening in the name of this.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/can-nepal-dispute-players.html,sports

Nepal fail to qualify for ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier,"Sunday, November 28, 2021","Kathmandu, November 28
Nepal have failed to qualify for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier.
Nepal had the possibility of reaching the next round if they had won their last Asia Regional Qualifier match against the UAE on Sunday. However, they lost the match played in Dubai to the hosts by 48 runs.
Batting first, the UAE had posted a 128-run target for Nepal to follow, but they could only score 79 runs before they lost all wickets.
Meanwhile, the hosts have been qualified for the Global Qualifier as they ended the regional round with five straight victories. Nepal won three but lost two of the matches played.
Mathematically, Nepal, however, still hold some possibility of playing the next qualifier as the best team among the regional runners-up. But, this will depend on teams of other regions. Even if Hong Kong defeat Kuwait during the last Asia Regional Qualifier match today, Nepal will end the event in the third position, and they cannot play the next round.

"Basketball, despite winning medals for Nepal, falls prey to a leadership crisis","Friday, October 29, 2021","Sadhish Pradhan, the captain of Nepal’s basketball team, was frustrated after the South Asian Games that took place in Nepal in 2019. Despite little support from the government or the Nepal Basketball Association (NeBA), his team had won a bronze medal at the games. He was proud of that, but he was appalled by how little respect the National Sports Council and the government showed to the team.
After the event was over, then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli announced that gold medallists in team events would receive a cash prize of Rs 500,000 each, but during his address, Oli did not talk about handing out cash rewards to teams that won silver and bronze medals at the South Asian Games.
That meant the basketballs teams, both men’s and women’s, that had won bronze and silver medals respectively would be getting nothing. But, to make sure their voices were heard, Pradhan and his teammates approached Ramesh Silwal, then general secretary of the National Sports Council.
“It reached a tipping point. We’ve been ignored for so long, and as the captain, I had to step up and say something,” says Pradhan.
But, nothing changed. Silwal told Pradhan that they were just following international practice in rewarding players. Yet, the basketballers felt betrayed and neglected.
Out of all the sports, basketball seems to be one of the most ignored sports in Nepal. This has resulted in players quitting; some have gone abroad while some are still here and playing but not for the national team as they see no future.
“I’ve reached a point where I have to tell my players to do what they want. I can’t ask them to sacrifice everything and play this game they love because it’s clear no one at the government level cares about basketball,” says Pradhan.
The women’s captain, Sadina Shrestha, also echoes Pradhan. Prior to the South Asian Games, most of her players left Nepal and went abroad. Others quit playing. But, besides that, the team gave their all and earned a silver medal at the games.
“We didn’t even receive a well done. It’s like sports in Nepal is just limited to football and cricket,” she says.
Two years have passed since the games. But, always, basketball has become a forgotten sport as no tournaments have been held at any level. Nepal Basketball League did give players some hope, but citing Covid-19, NeBA has made no efforts to revive the league.
What is even worse is that the association that should work towards the benefit of the sport is doing little to nothing. Pradhan says that the players have been trying to hold talks with the association and its acting president Bhimsen Gurung, but the efforts have gone in vain as the president just does not answer the calls.
Pradhan says he has been trying to hold conversations with NeBA about taking part in the SABA Championship that is due to take place in Bangladesh next month. But there has been no reply, says Pradhan.
“We’ve been trying to contact them for a long time, but we’ve received no answer. It seems they don’t want to take part because with less than 30 days to go, and with no practice even if we do go, we’ll only end up humiliating ourselves,” says Pradhan.
Onlinekhabar tried contacting the NeBA and Gurung, but our efforts went in vain just like Pradhan’s.
But, how did basketball, a sport that is played widely until high school, get to where it is?
Former captain Bipendra Maharjan, who played the game for over a decade, says one of the reasons that blocked the growth of the sport was the absence NeBA’s former president Lama Tendi Sherpa. Since Sherpa left office due to health reasons, the sport has been neglected and left in ruins.
“I don’t know who leads NeBA now. Whoever is there is undoing everything Lama dai was doing. He (Lama) understood the game and was always looking to talk to players to improve the sport in Nepal,” says Maharjan.
Current captains Pradhan and Shrestha also say Sherpa constantly held talks with them about uplifting the game. But now, the new leadership is avoiding them.
“It’s disheartening because we’ve given so much to this game. We’ve gone out of our way and even arranged sponsorships and everything. But, in return, we get the cold shoulder,” says Shrestha who had hoped things would get better after the South Asian Games.
Pradhan says if the team could take part in the competition without NeBA, they would. But, as these competitions require the teams to be represented by a national association, the team’s hands are tied as frustration grows among players.
Sujan Limbu has represented Nepal since the U-15 level. Limbu, who is the current captain of the U-18 team also, says he will most likely quit as he sees no future.
“I’m looking for jobs and to build a career,” says Limbu. “I’ll play basketball because I love this sport, but I don’t know if I will want to play for Nepal because there is no future for us and it has been evident by the lack of respect and care shown to us by the association.”
He says the only people who can continue playing basketball are those who come from good family backgrounds. As for others, there is no choice but to look to do something else to sustain themselves.
“That’s reality and it hurts that no one cares about us,” says Limbu.
Team captains Sadina Shrestha and Sadhish Pradhan are approaching their final few years. They know that soon they will have to call it a day. But, as they wait for that day, they want to make things better for the coming generation.
“The reason we are speaking now is that we have nothing to lose. We’re in our twilight and want a better system for the younger generation,” says Pradhan. “It’s important that we act now because our game has gone back two years already and if we continue to disregard it, we won’t be surprised if it’ll be completely forgotten.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/basketball-nepal.html,sports

Nepal football team to play SAFF Championship final for the first time–against India,"Thursday, October 14, 2021","Kathmandu, October 14
The Nepal football team are set to play the final of the ongoing SAFF Championship against the arch-rival India. This is the first time that Nepal have made it to the final of the regional tournament.
During their last league-round match played in Male of the Maldives on Wednesday, Nepal played a 1-1 draw with Bangladesh, adding one point to their scoreboard and opening the doors to the final. Likewise, in their last match, India defeated the hosts 3-1.
In the Nepal-Bangladesh match, Anjan Bista scored a goal in the 88th minute, taking advantage of a penalty opportunity, to save the Nepal football team from losing.
In the five-team event, India collected eight points and Nepal seven from four matches each. Now, they will play the final at 8:45 pm Nepal time on Saturday.
In the league-round match during the two countries, India had defeated Nepal 0-1 this Sunday.
Because the Nepal football team had never reached the final of the tournament, the game itself will be a historic achievement notwithstanding the result. But, Nepal are looking forward to a victory as it will be the last match for the team’s ambitious coach Abdullah Al Mutairi. Al Mutairi reiterated his plan of leaving Nepal football after the final during the post-match conference on Wednesday also.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-football-saff-championship-final.html,sports
Sandeep Lamichhane is the ICC Player of the Month for September 2021,"Monday, October 11, 2021","Kathmandu, October 11
Nepal’s cricket superstar Sandeep Lamichhane has won the title of the ICC Player of the Month for September 2021.
“Lamichhane had a stellar month, coming up with some staggering performances during the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2. He played six ODIs, scalping 18 wickets at an average of 7.38 and an economy of 3.17 and was the stand-out bowler during the tournament,” the international cricket governing body says on Monday.
Lamichhane beat Bangladesh left-arm orthodox Nasum Ahmed and USA’s hard-hitting batter Jaskaran Malhotra — who themselves delivered some scintillating performances in the month, says the ICC.
The International Cricket Council awards one player in the men’s category and another in the women’s category the title every month based on votes by former players, journalists and broadcasters, as well as cricket fans from around the world who are invited to vote on ICC’s channels.

Nepal beat Paupa New Guinea by 2 wickets,"Tuesday, September 7, 2021","Kathmandu, September 7
Nepal narrowly beat Papua New Guinea by two wickets in a one-day international match held in Al Amerat in Oman on Tuesday.
Winning the toss, the PNG opted to bat first, putting up only 134 on board. Debutant Bikram Sob rocked the PNG’s top order with two quick wickets, including one from this first ball in ODI cricket.
Spinners Sandeep Lamichhane and Kushal Malla then piled the pressure on PNG picking up wickets at regular intervals.
A few of their batters did get starts, but Lamichhane’s four wickets and Malla’s two wickets broke the PNG’s middle order as Nepal restricted them to a modest score.
Things were not as straightforward for Nepal during the chase. Debutants Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Bhurtel put up a 46-run stand, but the middle order crumbled as soon as the openers got out. Captain Gyanendra Malla and Sharad Vesawkar never really got going as they got out cheaply.
The innings was rescued by Rohit Paudel and Sompal Kami putting up a 52-run stand to win Nepal the game.
The next game will take place on September 10.
Nepal are currently in Oman to take on the USA and Oman in the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 tournament that begins on September 13.

Nepal football: 4 lessons to learn for the future from 2 friendlies with India,"Tuesday, September 7, 2021","When Sunil Chhetri was running through on goal following a counter by the Indian national team, everyone at the stadium and at home knew that the game was all over for Nepal football team. Having been played in by youngster Anirudh Thapa, Chhetri calmly dispatched the ball beyond Nepal’s goalkeeper and captain Kiran Kumar Limbu to give India an unassailable lead putting the game all beyond doubt.
As India led Nepal 2-0, the scoreline flattered the visitors who, for many parts of the match, were the second-best team. Despite being 63 positions below India and not having the domestic structure or the infrastructure that their neighbours have, Nepal played with a lot of heart as they made everyone at the stadium proud.
Tej Tamang did manage to get a late consolation with a long-range effort, but in the end, Nepal, who missed out on a lot of scoring chances, were left to rue these misses as India held on to win the match and continued their unbeaten streak against Nepal.
That said, there were many positives for Nepal football from the two friendly matches held on September 2 and 5 in Kathmandu that Nepal can take before they go to the Maldives to take part in the SAFF Championship.
Despite not winning, Nepal showed they were playing as one unit with one goal, making people proud of their performance. Indian coach Igor Stimac praised the manner in which Nepal played as did most of their players who after the match talked about how hard they had to play to win.
What was impressive about Nepal football performance during the two games was how well they defended as a team. Believing in each other, they gave no space to the Indian attackers who had to resort to long balls and crosses. During the 1-1 draw in the first game, India’s playmaker Bradon Fernandes rarely got any space to put his head up and look for teammates. Pujan Uperkoti who has been a revelation in Nepal’s midfield marked Fernandes very well. His robust tackling and match awareness were key as Nepal nullified the Indian midfield. You also have to give a lot of props to Tej Tamang and Suman Lama who pressed India’s midfield in such a manner they hardly did anything. It took them 50 minutes to register their second shot on target, as they mostly resorted to hopeful long balls and crosses testing Nepal’s Limbu with every chance they got. Going forward the midfield was just as important as they won the ball quickly and passed it forward. Nepal team playing intricate short passes was a joy to watch. More of this can help Nepal football do well and reach the finals of the SAFF Championship.
The midfield trio were impressive again as they did the same thing in the second game. Thapa who had played instead of Fernandes also had a lot of trouble finding spaces as Nepal dominated India in midfield in the first half of the second game. Their pressing was on point as was their passing and movement as the midfield created chances for wide players to put the ball in the box. The solitary goal Nepal scored in the second game was also a result of pressing and winning balls back from their Indian counterparts. If the trio get the guidance they are receiving now, Nepal football’s future is bright.
In the past, Nepal football teams have let goals in too easily. A similar thing happened in the two matches as well, but prior to conceding, they looked quite solid. With Rohit Chand in Indonesia, Abdullah Al Mutairi had to opt for a makeshift defence. Al Mutairi played Dinesh Rajbanshi as Ananta Tamang’s partner in central defence in both games. Both Tamang and Rajbanshi did quite a good job as they tamed India’s attackers. Sunil Chhetri, an all-time great who has scored almost as many international goals as Lionel Messi has done, hardly had any chances. Right-back Gautam Shrestha did look a bit nervous, but with time, he also looked settled to block out India’s attack. Al Mutairi did change things a bit at left-back. Suman Aryal played well in the first game as he combined well with Anjan Bista creating a lot of chances for Nepal from the left-hand side.
Despite a good showing, Al Mutairi changed things in the second game and he gave rest to both Bista and Aryal. Aryal was surprisingly replaced by Sujal Shrestha, who for the most part of his career, has always played an attacking role. It looked an odd fit as Shrestha did not feel comfortable. While Nepal’s attacks came mostly from the left in the first game, in the second, it was balanced as wingers Manish Dangi and Ayush Ghalan impressed the fans of Nepal football with their skill and pace.
The goals the defence conceded, however, were disappointing. In the first game, the blame has to go to Kiran Kumar Limbu who parried a fierce shot in the air only for Anirudh Thapa to tap the ball in. In the second, the first goal was completely avoidable as the lack of concentration led to a simple goal by Farukh Choudhary. The second was a brisk counterattack following a corner from Nepal. Nepal could have done better in transition, but as they were chasing the game, it was understandable. Al Mutrairi will be hoping that the defence does not make similar mistakes in the forthcoming SAFF Championship.
Going forward, the players showed a lot of potentials for Nepal football. They played ball in spaces and players ran through the channels. Nepal overloaded India and outnumbered them when in possession playing intricate passes in small and big triangles. Uperkoti and Tej Tamang were key in this as they burst forward whenever they felt they had a chance along with Suman Lama. Nepal’s attacking in game one was not up to the mark as both teams were cagey.
However, in the second match, things were different. Nepal created numerous chances as they created pressure after pressure.
Manish Dangi should have scored after he was at the end of a deflected shot, but he could not apply the finishing touch. Forward Aashish Lama also had a great chance to score, but his header went wide. Apart from these two chances, there were numerous opportunities to score in the second half too. Substitute Bishal Rai missed a sitter after being set up by Nawayug Shrestha and Dangi once again missed from close range to level the match. Al Mutairi in his post-match conference said he was happy with the performance but added that his players needed to believe in themselves more in situations like that. That said, Nepal have to do a lot more on finishing if they want to win the SAFF Championship.
Kiran Kumar Limbu is arguably the best goalkeeper Nepal football teams have had. His shot-saving ability along with distribution needs to be applauded. But, in the past few matches, he has been prone to mistakes that result in goals. It would be harsh on him to say that the goal Nepal conceded in game one was his fault, but he should have been able to get a better hand on it. His confidence when it comes to crosses should also improve because opponents will put in crosses to test him. He needs to work on this side of the game if Nepal have any chance of winning the SAFF Championship.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-football-lessons-india.html,sports
Nepal women football team to play 2 friendlies against Bangladesh,"Sunday, September 5, 2021","Kathmandu, September 5

"With Paras Khadka retired, these 4 players need to step up for Nepal cricket","Friday, September 3, 2021","For the first time in over a decade, Nepal’s cricket team will take part in a tournament without Paras Khadka. Even though he had missed a few series in the past few years due to injuries, Khadka, who announced his retirement from international cricket on August 3, will be at home cheering for his former teammates and brothers as they take on Oman and the United States of America in the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 tournament.
The fans are definitely going to miss Nepal’s talisman who had the capability to win the match with both bat and ball. His poise and persistence along with his unparalleled leadership are what set him apart and that is what the team is going to miss the most.
So, how will Nepal replace someone like Khadka who averages over 50 runs when Nepal wins ODI matches? Apart from that, he was quite handy with the ball too. Who can forget the game against Hong Kong where he took a wicket of his first ball? He was more than a leader. He was an icon. One who will be incredibly hard to replace.
Today, we look at a few players who can fill in the void left by Nepal’s captain, leader and legend.
Replacing Khadka as the captain has been a huge task for Malla who, so far, has done a stellar job. He has given chances to young players and led from the front. His performance with the bat has not been something to rave about, but in the past two years, he has always stood up when the team has needed him. But, his batting and leadership, especially now, will be crucial as Nepal take on Oman and the USA.
After Dipendra Singh Airee made his debut in 2018, he has been regular with the national team. As the current vice-captain of the team, it is likely that he will be Nepal’s captain after Gyanendra Malla retires. As someone who can bat and bowl, Airee has the ability to do what Khadka did, but his leadership abilities are questionable. That said, he is being groomed to be the next captain.
Having played all over the world under different captains, Lamicchane is one of the most would-be Nepal’s captains. He has been playing since his teenage years and represented Nepal at almost all levels of international cricket. Groomed by one of Australia’s finest captains Michael Clarke, he was destined for greatness from an early age. He leads from the front with the ball and has gotten a bit better with the bat, but whether he can lead the team is yet to be seen. There have been questions about his temperament in the media, but for someone who wears his heart on his sleeve, when he plays for Nepal, there are chances that he becomes Nepal’s next cricketing icon to take Nepal cricket forward.
Paudel played for the national team when he was 15. At such a tender age, he has played some valuable innings including one where he etched his name in the history books as he became the youngest player in international cricket to hit a half-century, surpassing legendary Sachin Tendulkar and Shahid Afridi. His form, however, does dip at times, but still young, the youngster has huge potential and can be a future leader of the cricket team if groomed properly.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-cricket-post-paras-khadka.html,sports
2 major reasons why Dav Whatmore resigned as Nepal cricket coach,"Wednesday, September 1, 2021","Kathmandu, September 1
Dav Whatmore, on August 27, resigned as the coach of Nepal’s cricket team. This came as a shock to many as he announced his desire to leave as the Nepal team were already in Oman to take on the hosts and the USA in the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 tournament.
When he joined Nepal, he was tasked to do two things, perform well in the World Cup League 2 tournament and make sure Nepal kept its ODI status intact. But with three months still to go as per his contract, he quit.
Why? There are major two reasons.
Officials who worked closely with Whatmore say he quit because he did not get what he wanted and was left disappointed by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).
CAN, which was suspended by the ICC in 2016, had finally resolved all the disputes as a new board was formed under the leadership of Chatur Bahadur Chand. But, the Chand-led board has not been as successful as people had hoped it would be. Even Whatmore had hoped things would change. But as he did not see any changes, he left, say people close to Whatmore.
Sources say that Whatmore wanted separate coaches for bowling and batting and also wanted a technical analyst. But, CAN refused to give him these people. He tried talking to CAN officials, but everyone had a different point of view on the issue, which frustrated the World Cup-winning coach.
Sources in CAN tell Onlinekhabar that during the start of his stint, he was not paid on time too. That had also left a bad taste along with the attitude of some players. He had complained that few players did not obey him. Paras Khadka retiring also played a factor as he would lose someone who had a grip on the dressing room.
“CAN is a mess and he is not someone who cleans the mess. He felt enough is enough and quit. No one can blame him,” says a source in CAN.
But, CAN President Chand does not agree with claims that he left because of CAN. He says Whatmore was happy with CAN as it had been doing most things he asked for and was paying him on time.
“Nepal wasn’t in his priority, that is why he left,” says Chand.
Before Whatmore came to Nepal, he was on the verge of joining the Baroda Cricket Association in India. But, due to Covid-19, Ranji Trophy, India’s domestic cricket tournament, was cancelled. Chand says he came to Nepal because he could not go to Baroda.
“I feel he didn’t have an intention to stay here. He had some free time, that is why he came here,” claims Chand.
Chand’s claim seems valid too. The Times of India on March 8 had written Whatmore would return as the Baroda coach as soon as he could.
Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) president, Pranav Amin, had told the paper Whatmore would join the association as the coach of the Ranji team in the upcoming cricketing season.
“We wanted him to stay till March 2022, but he didn’t want to stay. It’s okay; things like these happen. We will move on,” says Chand.
Former captain Khadka, however, says it would have been better had Nepal been able to keep hold of such an experienced coach.
“I don’t know why he quit; but had he stayed, we would have surely improved,” says Khadka.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/reasons-dav-whatmore-resigned-nepal-cricket-coach.html,sports

Sandeep Lamichhane to play for Hobart Hurricanes at Big Bash League,"Thursday, August 26, 2021","Kathmandu, August 26
Sandeep Lamichhane has been resigned by the Hobart Hurricanes for the upcoming season of the Big Bash League. He is the only overseas player to be contracted by the Hurricanes so far.
Having played two seasons with the Melbourne Stars, Lamichhane signed with the Hurricanes last season and played eight games. This was the only franchise cricket he played in 2021 as he has been unlucky with other tournaments.
“I am looking forward to returning to Australia and playing with the Hurricanes again this year,” Lamichhane told Cricinfo. “I really enjoyed my time with the Hurricanes last season, so I’m excited that I will be there for the whole tournament this year.
Lamichhane missed out on Vitality Blast this year due to a visa delay. His luck with franchise cricket has been awful this year as he did not get to play in The Hundred due to visa issues even though he had a valid visa.

Gulshan Jha: Nepal’s 17-year-old fast bowler shows promise for the future,"Wednesday, August 25, 2021","Competing in the inaugural Kathmandu Mayor’s Cup in March 2021, Gulshan Jha did not have a lot of expectations. At 17, all he wanted was to play at least one game. But, little did the six-foot-tall fast bowler know that the tournament would change his life.
After performing well in the tournament, including a man of the match performance in the finals, Jha has left Nepal with the national cricket team to take on Oman and the USA in Cricket World Cup League 2. Now, he hopes to make his debut for the national team and help take Nepali cricket to new heights.
Born and brought up in Sarlahi of southeastern Nepal, Jha played cricket from an early age. But, he wanted to get better, that is why in 2016 he left Sarlahi and went to Ranchi in Jharkhand, India, to learn more about the game he loved. He enrolled himself at Arunodaya Cricket Academy where he learnt cricket for four years.
“That is where my career began,” he says.
He was doing well there, but Covid-19 hit India hard, which resulted in him coming back to Nepal. In Nepal, he was staying idle when heard about the Prime Minister’s Cup taking place in Kathmandu. He went to the Province 2 trials for the tournament, but he did not make the final team. Yet, he did not lose hope as he continued to train.
In February, he heard about the Mayor’s Cup and got into Nepal Police’s team. Even though he did not get many chances, whenever he did, he showed his potential. He made his tournament debut against Kathmandu Mayor’s XI. He did not take any wickets, but the young pacer was economical as he gave away just 22 runs in six overs.
His breakout game came in the final. Not fazed by the occasion, he dismantled Armed Police Force’s top order to bits. In the seven overs he bowled, he took four wickets giving away just 22 runs as he was declared the player of the match. That impressed everyone watching, including newly appointed Nepali coach Dav Whatmore, as he made his way to the closed camp of the national cricket team.
His real test will begin now as getting into Nepal’s playing eleven is not going to be an easy task. Sompal Kami and Karan KC, both of whom are handy with the bat, lead Nepal’s fast bowling. Avinash Bohora has also been doing quite well for the national team as Bikram Sob is also making his comeback into the national team.
“I’ve done well to get here. But, I know how hard it is going to get into the first team. This is like a dream come true and I hope I can do well,” says Jha.
He says when he got the call that he was in the touring team, he was over the moon.
“I couldn’t believe it. I’d just returned from training when I got the call. It was a special moment.”
He says he is cherishing every moment as this is what he had dreamed of as a child. Apart from cricket, he has learnt a lot about discipline from the senior players. He says as he hopes he can make his family and well-wishers proud when he gets the chance.
“The senior players and coaches have been wonderful to me. I’ve learnt a lot from them and hope I can perform at my best level when the team needs me,” says Jha.
His USP as a bowler is pace and bounce, but he still has a long way to go if he wants to get into the playing set. He himself knows how challenging it is going to play ahead of the fast bowlers Nepal has, but he is ready.
“It’s good that we have all these fast bowlers in the team. I have learnt a lot about what ball to bowl and when. They also told me about the batsman’s psyche,” he says, adding Whatmore has asked him to go express himself and play without pressure.
It is highly likely that Jha will make his debut against the two-match ODI series against Papua New Guinea that takes place on September 5 and 8. If he performs well, he will surely book his place in the team that will take on Oman and the USA in the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 taking place in Oman from September 13 to 20.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gulshan-jha-nepal-cricket-emerging-fast-bowler.html,sports

"Paras Khadka shares his ambition for cricket management, then politics","Wednesday, August 4, 2021","Kathmandu, August 4
One day after announcing his retirement from international cricket, the Nepal cricket team’s former captain Paras Khadka said he wanted to lead the country’s cricket management.
He also said he could join politics if he was proved successful in cricket governance. Stating managing cricket would be his priority, he said, “But, if there is a good opportunity, I could be in politics also.”
For the past few years, the popular player has been reiterating the country’s cricket management should improve and he would for that. Following his retirement, Khadka hosted a press conference in Kathmandu on Wednesday and clearly articulated that he left playing because he wanted to take a key role in the country’s cricket-governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal.
CAN will elect its new executive committee in the next two years and Khadka is expected to vie for some key position. He said his journey towards that end already began today.

Paras Khadka announces retirement from international cricket,"Tuesday, August 3, 2021","Kathmandu, August 3
Nepali cricketer Paras Khadka has announced retirement from international cricket.
The former national captain, via social media, announced that now was the right time to step away from Nepal’s national team, having played for them for the past 18 years.
“Why now? Because it’s about time. As a cricketer, I have given my heart, blood and soul and have always dreamt to achieve the best for my country,” he wrote on Facebook.
He thanked all his coaches, fans and his teammates for the support he received for why he played for Nepal and added that he wished nothing but good for the game in the country.
“My ultimate dream is to see Nepal have a better cricketing system, for which I have spent all my energy in the past two decades,” he wrote. “I believe, with everyone’s honest effort and intentions, we will be able to reach greater heights.”
The national team will find it hard to fill the gap Khadka leaves behind as he was handy with both bat and ball.
Khadka made his way to the national team after playing age-group cricket representing Nepal in three U-19 World Cups between 2004 and 2008 and winning the Plate Championship in 2006. He took over as captain of the national team in 2009, taking Nepali cricket from Division 5 to ODI status. One of his best achievements to date is taking Nepal to the 2014 T20 World Cup held in Bangladesh.
He had resigned from his post as the captain on October 15, 2019, and was replaced by Gyanendra Malla.

Nepal football controversy: Coach Abdullah Al Mutairi apologises for controversy,"Monday, August 2, 2021","Kathmandu, August 2
Nepal football team’s head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi, who had announced his resignation from the position last week owing to a dispute with some members of the All Nepal Football Association, says he apologises for a statement that brought him to the dispute.
In a Facebook post, Al Mutairi said, “Following up with some of my loving and supporting football family in the past few days, I have realised my version caused some wrongly speaking perpetuates, and for that, I am so deeply sorry.”
He, however, clarified, “While speaking about the Nepal national team and its players, my intentions were simply to tell where and how our team Nepal and other Asian nations developed in football in the last three decades.”
During a recent interview, he had said ANFA should change some officials to improve the status of football in the country.
Meanwhile, the national football governing body has asked the Ministry of Youth and Sports to look into the dispute between Al Mutairi and ANFA Senior Vice-President Pankaj Nembang, which made him announce his resignation.

Nepal in Tokyo Olympics 2020: Here are 2 positives and 3 negatives to remember,"Sunday, August 1, 2021","With the elimination of athlete Saraswati Chaudhary, who competed in the women’s 100 metres (athletics), from the preliminary round, the journey of Nepal in the ongoing Tokyo Olympics 2020 has come to an end, in about two weeks and a few days.
In this 32nd Summer Olympics, five athletes from four disciplines had participated on behalf of Nepal. Of them, three players improved the national records while the performance of the other two was average. All the players got eliminated from the first rounds in their respective categories.
Now, let’s get an overview of Nepal’s journey to the Tokyo Olympics 2020. Here, we sum up what Nepal did nice and not so nice in the Tokyo Olympics 2020–to remember for the future and learn from.
This time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had decided to allow one female and one male athlete to carry the flag of a country during the march-past at the opening ceremony. Swimmers Gaurika Singh and Alex Shah from Nepal carried the national flag.
Initially, the Nepal Olympic Committee (NOC) had stated that only Gaurika Singh would carry the national flag. But after the IOC decision, the only male participant, Alex also got that opportunity.
About 50 per cent of the participants at the Tokyo Olympics 2020 were women. From Nepal, four of the five participants were women.
From the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Nepali women athletes started participating in Olympics. Since 1992, there have been more female athletes than male athletes going to the Olympics. But, four is the highest number of Nepali women participating in a single edition of the event so far.
Shooting athlete Kalpana Pariyar, who got the opportunity to play at the Olympics with a wild card, improved her own national record. She set a new record of 616.8 in the women’s 10m air rifle. Earlier, she had scored 614.5 at the 13th SAG. She finished 46th out of 50 shooters competing at the event.
Likewise, swimmers Alex Shah and Gaurika Singh also improved their own records and personal times at the Tokyo Olympics. Competing in the men’s 100m freestyle, Shah improved his own record in the long course to a time of 53.41 seconds, and in the women’s 100m freestyle, Singh set a new record with a time of 1 minute 11 milliseconds. Shah finished 59th out of 71 players competing at the event.
Shah and Singh, both 18, had previously set the records of 56.28 seconds and 1 minute 62 milliseconds respectively at the 18th FINA World Championships in Guangzhou, South Korea.
This time, Shah also became the second athlete to be first in his heat. Earlier, Singh had become the first in her heat at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Although Kalpana Pariyar of shooting, and Gaurika Singh and Alexandra Shah of swimming improved their own national records, Nepal’s performance at the Olympics was limited to participation.
Winning a medal is a far-fetched dream for Nepal as it is still struggling to cross the first stage in the Olympics. Above this, it is a huge challenge for Nepali athletes to be selected and go to the Olympics. Nepal has been playing the Olympics with the help of universal reservation quotas and wild cards except for two players.
Those two exceptional players were taekwondo players Sangina Baidya and Deepak Bista who were selected for the Olympics in 2004 and 2008 respectively.
Initially, marathon runner Gopichandra Parki was finalised to compete in the women’s 100 metres in the Olympics. However, in the end, her name was removed and Saraswati Chaudhary got that chance.
But, her performance in Tokyo was poor. Chaudhary could not improve her own records. In the second heat, she finished the distance in 12.91 seconds and was in the eighth position out of nine players. Earlier, her time of 12.55 seconds at the 13th SAG was the best.
Likewise, judo player Soniya Bhatta competed in the women’s 48 kg judo with a wild card. But, she lost in the first round to Irina Dolgava of Russia. In Budokayo Nippon, she stood with the opposition for only one minute and 16 seconds
Like before, this time too, a jumbo team represented Nepal that included several officials more than double the number of athletes and the coaches. It was much criticised.
Although the list of participants (officials) for the Olympics was cut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a team of 17 officials besides five players and four coaches. However, three officials did not go.
Besides athletes, Tulasa Thapa, the wife of UML vice-chairperson Bamdev Gautam earned so much limelight. She is also the president of the Nepal Kabaddi Association, the secretary of the Nepal Olympic Committee, and a member of the Parliament. Though there was no participation of kabaddi players from Nepal, she went to Tokyo as a judo manager. It was rumoured that she had gone to visit Tokyo.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-in-tokyo-olympics-2020-here-are-2-positives-and-3-negatives-to-remember.html,sports

Nepal receives an offer to host SAFF Championship 2021,"Sunday, July 25, 2021","Kathmandu, July 25
Nepal has received a conditional offer from the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) to host the 13th edition of the SAFF Championship in October this year.
SAFF General Secretary Anwarul Huq sent a conditional hosting letter to Nepal’s football-governing body, All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) General Secretary Indra Man Tuladhar to host the championship in Nepal, the ANFA says in a statement today.
The statement quotes General Secretary Tuladhar to say the ANFA will now prepare a detailed proposal of the championship and send it to SAFF for approval.
“The final decision regarding hosting will be taken in the SAFF executive meeting which will take place in the first week of August.”
After Bangladesh Football Federation pulled out as the host due to the rising coronavirus infections in the country during a recent SAFF meeting, Nepal got the offer.

"Abdullah Al Mutairi: Giving a facelift to Nepal football, the coach wants to end his stint with SAFF victory","Wednesday, July 21, 2021","Losing 3-0 against Australia during the recent World and Asian Cup Qualifiers, Nepal’s head coach Abdullah Al Mutairi made changes that shocked everyone. Playing against the 41st best team in the world, with a man down, he would have been forgiven if he had made defensive changes. But, to everyone’s surprise, he brought on Anjan Bista as soon as Rohit Chand was sent off while he brought on Manish Dangi later in the half as Al Mutairi decided to attack. All this happened while the Australians kept on making changes that made their team stronger.
“They asked for our jersey in the end. That is the biggest sign of respect that any team could show us. My boys made me and the country proud that day,” says  Al Mutairi.
This attacking mentality was evident throughout the tournament as he made Nepal play in a manner that was not seen before. Long balls by the keeper were replaced by short intricate ground passes as players looked to find their teammates running in channels. Defensively, Nepal looked a lot better too as they did not spoil their shape as the players looked to play with a belief in their ability never seen before.
“That was possible with 12 days of work,” says Al Mutairi. “Imagine what these guys can do if they spend more time training.”
Now, his focus is all set on the upcoming SAFF Championship, in which he wants to make sure Nepal get their best results as both he and the team are working tirelessly to ensure that they at least reach the final as he wants to end his stint on a high.
“We’ve never reached the final. So reaching the final is the goal. If we win, that’s great,” says Al Mutairi, who adds there is no point putting unnecessary pressure on the team.
Al Mutairi was appointed Nepal’s head coach on April 4, a few days after Nepal won the Three Nations Cup, defeating Bangladesh 2-1 in the final. Having met with All Nepal Football Association’s president Karma Tsering Sherpa in Qatar in 2019 and 2020, he joined Nepal in 2021, replacing Swedish Johan Kalin.
“I liked the challenge,” he said.
In his first press conference, he laid the benchmark as he told journalists Nepal would no longer play defensive football. He sounded assertive as he said that he would play attacking football with the philosophy that European teams like Barcelona play with.
“I’ll play 4-3-3 and will pick players who fit in this system,” he had said.
And, that is exactly what he has been doing as that was the formation he used in all four games he has managed. But, to do that, he had to ensure that the team believed in him and his vision and goal.
Before taking over, he had three major goals on his mind, two of which he says he has already achieved.
“The first was to qualify for the third round of the Asian Cup Qualification which we have done. The second was to change the mindset and character of players and bring in more young players. That has also been done,” he says.
His final goal as the head coach is to reach the finals of the tournament as he aims to create history by doing so.
“If I am able to do this, I’ll be happy.”
For that, works are underway as the team has been training constantly as a 50-man closed camp has been shortlisted to 36 for the SAFF Championship which is due to take place in September.

The team look together too as they are put through the paces by Al Mutairi. But, that wasn’t the case when he first took over as he says that the national team, like most of Nepal, were quite divided.
“There were groups,” he says. “They were not together, but gradually they’ve come along as they’ve believed in my goal of playing as one group for the country.”
He says that players are coming on board with his philosophy as he is teaching them not to be scared.
“Previous coaches were too scared to lose and played too defensive. But, I am not scared to lose because it is a part of the game,” he says.
He is also teaching the players to be humble as he is leading from the front. Despite being offered a car, he travels to and from ANFA on his bicycle. Recently, he sent a pair of boots and a jersey to Neteesh Purbachane Magar from Bara after seeing the young boy playing with torn boots.
The players have also followed him as the team donated two projectors to an orphanage in the Kathmandu valley.
“It’s good that they are giving back. This will increase the brotherhood between them.”
Players are also believing in what he is trying to do. Biraj Maharjan, in an interview, told Annapurna Express how Nepal were lucky to have a coach like Al Mutairi. The former captain, who retired after the Three Nations Cup said Al Mutairi had energised the squad as the coach was planning to build the team for the future.
There are rumours that he has recently signed a six-month extension. But, nothing has been official as he remains coy about it. When asked if it is true, he brushes the question away as he says that his current focus is the SAFF Championship, after which he will decide if he wants to stay or go.
“There is a good chance that I will leave after the SAFF Championship,” he says. “I’ve had three offers from national teams who want to work with me, but I didn’t want to abandon these projects, which is why I will try to win the SAFF Championship.”
He seems happy with what ANFA has done for him too. He says the host has fulfilled all promises made to him while hiring and hails the work done by the president and his team.
“People say they have not worked for the development of football. But, they have,” he says. “They’ve just not marketed what they have done.”
He says works are underway to sign agreements with various organisations as ANFA is currently looking for a hospitality partner after signing an MoU with the Star Hospital as the national team’s medical partner.
“We need the help of these organisations to develop the game.”
His hope now is that Nepal develops its league structure as he believes that in its current format, football will take years to develop. Mentioning the single-round league system, he says that a two-round, six-month league, is a necessity at the moment. For that, clubs have to be on board, he says.
“They need to be a bit practical and support ANFA because they have plans that are great for Nepali football,” he says. “But, the clubs need to stop being selfish because until they don’t do that, football in Nepal will never get better.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/abdullah-al-mutairi-nepal-football-coach-interview.html,sports
"Lamichhane to miss a few games of The Hundred due to visa issues, might miss the entire tournament","Tuesday, July 20, 2021","Kathmandu, July 20
Nepali leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane will miss the first few games of The Hundred, professional cricket franchise 100-ball cricket tournament, due to start from July 21.
Due to visa issues, there is a chance he might not be able to play in the tournament altogether. Lamichhane, who went to England on a Tier-5 visa might not be able to play through that visa, according to ESPN Cricinfo.
Lamichhane was bought by Ovals Invincibles for GBP 60,000. The club will play their first game against the Manchester Originals on Thursday.
Lamichhane reached London on July 8 and has already severed the 10-day mandatory quarantine, but with his visa not sorted out, his appearance in the first few games has been ruled out. If he does get to play in the remainder of the tournament is still a mystery.
In June, he had missed an opportunity to play in the Vitality Blast due to a delay in the visa procedure.
Sam Billings, the captain of Oval Invincibles told ESPN Cricinfo that he was unsure about what was happening.
“I obviously heard that today and fingers crossed he can get here. It has been a difficult time for a lot of players with the various restrictions and things around the world. Hopefully, that can get resolved [because] he’s a special talent. If not, back to the drawing board,” he told ESPN.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lamichhane-to-miss-a-few-games-of-the-hundred-due-to-visa-issues-might-miss-the-entire-tournament.html,sports
Nirjala Tamrakar: Meet Nepal’s first woman to complete a full-distance triathlon,"Tuesday, July 20, 2021","For Nirjala Tamrakar, January to June 2021 were probably the hardest six months of her life. At 41, she was at a crossroads in her life. Dissuaded and lost, she wanted something that would make her feel alive again.
She had been Nepal’s national mountain biking champion for 12 years, from 2001 to 2012, only stopping to start a family. In those 12 years, she had taken part in national and international tournaments in South Asia, Middle East and Europe. In 2012, she had taken part in the Mountain Bike World Cup in France as she stood on the podiums in around 80 per cent of her races. But once she quit, things changed for her. But, her desire and hunger to race never disappeared.
“It was tough to give up, but for my children, I had to. But, I always knew that I would be back,” says Tamrakar.
And, back she came as the month of six and three-year-old kids. More determined and hungry to do something that would fill her life with passion again, she set herself a goal. The goal was a mammoth one as she wanted to take part in a full-distance (226 km) triathlon event.
Having already taken part in a sprint-distance triathlon event (25.75 km) during the 2019 South Asian Games, she was more determined and passionate to do something for herself. On June 6 this year, after 15 hours and 13 minutes, she did exactly that, as she completed the UK Ultimate Triathlon event that took place in Whitchurch. But, to get there, she sacrificed a lot as she battled her inner demons, even putting her marriage on the line, as she achieved a long-held dream of becoming Nepal’s first woman to complete a full-distance triathlon.
“It’s the proudest moment of my life. There were times where I was physically exhausted, but my mental strength helped me push myself to the finish line,” says Tamrakar, who wants to inspire mothers like her to push themselves to do the things they want to do in life even after giving birth.
But, the road to the finish line was not easy for her.
She made a comeback in 2018 taking part in a cross-country cycling race called the Waling 100. But, the race did not go as she had hoped it would after which her focus shifted to the 2019 National Games, in which she wanted to test herself in the triathlon event. But as she had doubts over her swimming abilities in open water, she opted to take part in the duathlon event.
“I could swim in the pool, but swimming in a lake was incredibly hard. My teammates from the Armed Police Force motivated me, but I felt I needed more training before I swam in open waters.”
She came second in that event and it gave her added motivation to work hard to take part in the sprint triathlon event at the 2019 South Asian Games.
“Fitness-wise, I was good. I’d started to run in Ranibari to regain the fitness I had in the late 2000s. But, my main issue was learning how to swim in open waters.”
Tamrakar, who was a contract player with the Armed Police Force, took help from her teammates to learn how to swim in the Phewa Lake. Swimming there with fellow triathletes from the APF, she started to gain confidence as she decided that she was ready to take part in the triathlon event during the SAG.
“I loved swimming in the pool, but open water was a different ball game. I had to get over the fact that nothing would happen to me.”
After learning and unlearning a few things, she mastered the art of swimming in open water and took part in the short triathlon race during the SAG.
“It was a great experience. Normally, people take part in multiple short-distance triathlon events like these before they opt for a full-length triathlon event but I was already in my late 30s so I decided that it was now or never and decided that I would take part in a full Ironman-distance triathlon.
She was fit, but to take part in the 226-kilometre race, she needed to be extremely fit. Her training started when she moved to the UK where her husband Dan Wright had relocated. When she reached the UK with her kids in December 2020, the country was on complete lockdown. She found it hard to adjust to life there.
“I knew no one who could help me train. My husband would be busy with work or looking after the kids as I went out in the cold damp weather to train.”
With things risky, she made no friends there and would normally run alone around her neighbourhood to practice for the 42 km she would have to run during the event. But, for cycling, things were different.
“As I didn’t know the place and was a bad navigator, I did most of my cycling training indoors using a roller.”
She trained between one to five hours a day depending on her training plan as she also had to give her body proper rest. The UK’s cold weather also helped her a lot, but she still had one major problem, finding a place to swim. Due to Covid-19, swimming pools were shut, which meant she had nowhere she could train. It opened on April 12, 2021, but only for an hour each day. The race would take place at Alderford Lake and swimming in a heated pool would not be helpful.
“I and Dan started looking for places where I could swim. There was a river close by, but as it was only February, the water was very cold.”
With rivers a bad option, she started looking for lakes. But swimming in lakes in the UK was not allowed. It was not until May that she was finally able to swim at a lake. But, as it was quite a distance, her husband used to drive her to the lake where she would swim for an hour.
“Dan has been so helpful in all of this. Yes, there were times where we fought and our marriage was pushed to the limit. But, he stuck with me and helped me.”
The race day was approaching, but she was yet to get accustomed to the cold water. To ensure that she would be ready, she started to take cold showers. But, things did not change as she struggled a lot and even contemplated doing half of what she had initially planned.
However, other athletes told her that by June, the water would warm up and as the lake is not too deep, a few days of sunshine would mean that it would be a lot warmer than what it was in May. Those words calmed her as she felt that if she did not do the full distance triathlon now, she would never do it in her life.
“I had put in a lot of effort to reach a fitness level needed for the race. I’d sacrificed a lot and fought with my family. These times were stressful, but despite the stress and anxiety, I didn’t lose focus.”
Pre-race, she was nervous. She had been through a lot in the past six months. The night before the race, she hardly slept as she kept on thinking about it. This was what she had wanted to do ever since she decided to make a comeback in 2017. Four years of hard work had brought her to a place where she wanted to be.
It had rained a lot the night before as the weather in the north of England was typical of how anyone would describe them – cold, cloudy and damp. Nervous and excited at the same time, she started the race quite well as she swam 3.8 km in one hour 56 minutes.
“When I finished swimming, I saw my family cheering me on. That motivated me a lot.”
The cycling section was what she knew could make up time. But, she understood that she could not push too hard as she had to run a full marathon distance after this. She completed the 180 km event in 7 hours 12 minutes. At the transition, she knew the final hurdle would be hard. She had given it her all in the past nine hours but knew that if she did not complete the last stretch of the race, she would regret it.
“I pushed myself a lot. I had come too far to not finish.”
She ran with pride and confidence for most of the 42km race. But with 14 km to go, she started feeling dizzy. She tried to walk as she wanted to complete the race.
“I thought about Dan and my kids and ran like my life depended on it.”
In five hours 48 minutes, she reached the finish line running the final 50 metres with her two kids as she became the first Nepali woman to complete a full-distance triathlon. Emotions got the better of her after the announcer told everyone that she had done it after becoming a mother of two.
“It was overwhelming. Six months of intensive work and stubbornness had helped me reach the finish. It was an emotional moment.”
She says that she would not have done it without the help of her husband who, despite her being stubborn, stood with her.
“Anyone else would have left me. But, Dan stood by me and I’m incredibly thankful for that.”
She says that having done such a gruesome race, she hopes she can inspire Nepali women to push boundaries and do things that they love doing.
“I had no one from Nepal who I could look up to who’d done such a thing in endurance sport. There were a few mothers who proved to people that they could still compete at the highest level, but they were from a different sport. I hope that doing this will make young women want to do things that people have told them they could never do.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nirjala-tamrakar-meet-nepals-first-woman-to-complete-a-full-distance-triathlon.html,sports
"Bimalnagar: Nepal’s prime rock climbing attraction is at stake. But, stakeholders vow to save it","Tuesday, July 13, 2021","Bikash Gurung was rock climbing at Bimalnagar, Bandipur of Tanahun in April when he saw a few people with a tape measuring the distance from the Prithvi Highway to the climbing rock. Seeing people who were not climbing approach the rock, Gurung and a few of his friends, who were also climbing, got down and approached the officials.
“They told us they were a part of the road expansion team doing the measurements for a pre-feasibility study,” says Gurung.
The officials told them that as plans were in place to extend the highway from Mugling to Damauli and that as per the plan, it was likely that parts of the climbing rock would be affected during the extension.
“We were shocked when they told us that it might be gone when the road expansion takes place,” says Gurung.
This has caused an uproar within the climbing community of Nepal that feels it would be detrimental for the sport’s future in Nepal. The locals have also shown concern as the rock has had a positive impact on the community as the area, even though it is home to Siddha Cave, supposedly the second largest cave in South Asia, is known only because of the climbing rock.
“This is the area’s jewel; we will do everything we can to stop it from being demolished,” says Dhan Bahadur Thapa, ward number 4 chair of Bandipur rural municipality. “We’ve been holding talks with the centre and hopefully we might be able to find a way to save the rock.”
Various meetings, both online and in-person, have taken place as local leaders and stakeholders have been trying to explain to the authorities the need to save the rock, which for the past 15 years has been a centre of the universe for rock climbing in Nepal.
“The Chinese company building the road has promised it will try its best to save it,” says Purna Singh Thapa Magar, the chairman of Bandipur rural municipality. “There are chances that two routes might be affected, but they’ve also promised that they will build a better route if they have to demolish one.”
Magar, however, says that demolishing the routes will be the last resort as they are talking about other alternatives.
“I know what this place means to people and am all for saving it,” says Magar.
Every year, this place sees thousands of people. Some come to climb for leisure while others climb to train themselves as the wall is used by Nepal National Mountain Guide Association and Nepal Mountaineering Instructors Association to train mountain guides.
Local Lal Kumar Shrestha, who owns a guesthouse opposite the rock, says army and police personnel also use the rock for their yearly training.
“It’s a place for everyone. It has routes for beginners and for pro athletes. It would be a shame if anything happened to this. We will not let anything happen,” says Shrestha.
The rock was set up in 2006 by mountain guides Prem Gurung and friends in memory of Iman Grung, a mountaineer, instructor and adventurer who lost his life after being buried in an avalanche at Kang Garu in the Nar Phu valley in the Annapurna region. Since then, the rock has been a boon to anyone who is involved in mountaineering or adventure sport.
Its popularity rose in the 2010s after various mountaineering organisations started to train people there while a few also held competitions there. One person who took part in them was Niraj Karki, a former national champion and adventurer. Karki says it would be foolish to kill the wall which has been a climber’s paradise.
“If you ask any climber, they’ll tell you how important that place is. It’s invaluable for so many reasons and we need to do everything we can to save it,” says Karki.
The crag, according to Prem Gurung, is perfect for rock climbing as it is composed of limestone which is erosion-resistant and has durable surfaces making it easy to establish a new route on the cliff. The other reason, according to Prem, is its accessibility.
“It’s only 130 km from Kathmandu and 60 km from Pokhara,” says Prem Gurung. “There have been other walls in Kathmandu, but those aren’t as accessible as this one where tourists, climbers and adventurers can come spend a few days and leave. It was a win-win for all.”
The place has around 30 routes which have been divided into various grades. Some routes are harder than others as they are suitable for beginners to professionals. The wall is also is hope to Nepal’s first multi-pitch route.
“We use it to train ourselves before we go the mountain or to train young and upcoming climbers,” says Prem Gurung. “The place has a special place in the hearts of everyone who’ve known Iman and who’ve climbed here.”
Efforts have started from the locals and stakeholders as they have written to both the central and the provincial sports ministries, National Sports Council, Provincial Sports Council, District Administration Office, Bandipur rural municipality, the district’s sports development committee and the road expansion project.
“We’ve highlighted why this place is important in the letters we’ve written to them,” says Sujit Kandel, a member of the Bimalnagar Rock Climbing Conservation Committee. “We’ve had a positive response, but this is going to be a long battle for which we will have to be patient.”
He says that both the committee and the community understand it is a pride project and that the expansion should take place. But, Kandel adds that alternatives must be looked at before things move forward.
“It’s a pre-feasibility study and things can be amended, I’m sure. We’ve also suggested alternatives which can be taken into consideration by the road team,” says Kandel.
The recommendations include a request to reconsider expanding the area around Bimalnagar which they argue should be considered given that it is expected to affect a lot of people and organisations. The second recommendation includes shifting the highway towards the river.
“Looking back at what’s happened this monsoon, it might not be an ideal plan but they can see if that can be done,” adds Kandel.
The final recommendation they have given to the government is to make an alternative track to avoid the wall section completely.
“We hope they can consider this,” says Kandel.
Local Shrestha, on the other hand, says the authorities and the people who have been assigned the project want to target the rock and demolish it for mining.
“I’ve heard they want to mine the place for uranium and other minerals. The project is being handled by the Chinese and they’ve been telling how they want to extend the area 50 metres rather than 25 metres. If they do that, we will not stay quiet because this place means a lot to us,” says Shrestha.
However, rural municipality chair Magar says whatever Shrestha says is not entirely true as they also plan to make restaurants and other attractions near the wall.
“The Chinese have brought a plan to make the place attractive and I think the locals need to entertain some ideas,” he says.
The locals, however, do not trust the Chinese as they feel that they will do more harm than good.
“If they even think about damaging the rock, there will be retaliation,” says Shrestha.
But, for climbers like Karki, resorting to violence is not the answer as he feels that Iman’s legacy might be tarnished due to it.
“There is no alternative to Bimalnagar and that is what the major problem is right now. Authorities need to understand this because this place is historic,” says Karki. “The sad part is, if the authorities do demolish the place, people will not realise what we have lost.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rock-climbing-nepal-bimalnagar.html,sports

Cricket World Cup League 2 series involving Nepal postponed until July 2022,"Thursday, June 24, 2021","Kathmandu, June 24
The ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 series involving Scotland, Namibia and Nepal has been postponed due to the worsening Covid-19 crisis in Namibia, the international cricket governing body, International Cricket Confederation, says.
The ICC says the rising number of infections in the African country has impacted training preparations and the tightening of restrictions have reduced travel options. “This series – which forms part of League 2 which is two steps away from the Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 – has been postponed to July 2022, after exploring options to also stage the event in Spain this summer which became infeasible,” the ICC statement reads.
“We tried our best to play the series, but the tightening of restrictions in Namibia left us with no alternative but to postpone the event,” ICC Head of Events Chris Tatley is quoted in the statement.

"With AFC rule change, Nepal qualify for the third qualification round of the Asian Cup 2023","Wednesday, June 16, 2021","Kathmandu, June 16
Nepal have qualified for the third round of the forthcoming Asian Cup 2023 Qualifications. This comes after the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday changed its rules which meant Nepal would no longer have to play a playoff to get to the final round of qualification for the tournament due to be held in China in 2023.
The AFC’s rule meant that eight group winners and four best-placed teams along with the hosts China would automatically qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup. The remaining three second-placed teams along with 16 teams who came third and fourth in the group state will not qualify for the final qualifying round.
According to the AFC, the three best fifth-placed teams have also qualified for the final rounds making it 22 teams who have reached the final rounds including Nepal who finished fourth in their group.
Prior to this rule change on Wednesday, the AFC had said that only four of the eight fourth-placed teams would make it to the final round with the remaining four having to play a playoff to reach the last round. Had the rule be in place, Nepal would have to play a playoff to make it to the final round.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/with-afc-rule-change-nepal-qualify-for-the-third-qualification-round-of-the-asian-cup-2023.html,sports
"Nepal in World Cup, Asian Cup qualifiers: Positive performance despite negative results signals hope","Tuesday, June 15, 2021","When Rohit Chand received a red card for dragging back Martin Boyle on the cusp of halftime, it was clear that Nepal were in for a long night. They were getting mauled by Australia with 11 men on the field during the last match of this round of the World Cup and Asia Cup Qualifiers in Kuwait last Friday as they trailed 2-0 going into the half thanks to goals from Mathew Leckie and Fran Karacic. But, with their best players and talisman seeing red, things just got a lot harder.
Even though they started the second half better than they had done the first, they soon conceded a goal from Boyle after failing to deal with a simple cross into the box as Australia piled on the pressure. From that point on, things did not look better as Nepal continued to face the music as Australia piled on the pressure as they hit 36 shots in the allotted 90 minutes.
Attacking-wise, Nepal were poor as they did not even force the Australian keeper to make one save. But, defence-wise, there are things to be proud of particularly the performance of Kiran Chemjong, Ananta Tamang and Pujan Uparkoti. That all but ended Nepal’s chance at direct qualification into the next round of the Asian Cup Qualifier, but there were positive signs that have given Nepali fans hope.
“It is a tough loss but we gave our best,” said Abdullah Almutairi after the match. “Our game plan was to hit them on the counter, but when you’re playing such a good side who are physically dominant, it’s hard.”
Australia’s coach Graham Arnold also praised Nepal’s fighting mentality as highlighted that Nepal’s performance on Friday was much better than the one in Australia where they lost 5-0.
“They fought hard and didn’t stop running. They gave us a fight,” said Arnold.
Nepal played their remaining three matches of the World Cup and Asian Cup Qualifiers, out of which they won one against Chinese Taipei and lost the others with Australia and Jordan.
The win against Chinese Taipei was a routine one. Starting the game on the front foot, Nepal raced to an early lead as Anjan Bista dispatched an early penalty. Bista, throughout the game, had a lot of chances to extend Nepal’s lead, but poor decision making in the final third coupled with poor finish meant that the game remained tight until the 80th minute when Nawayug Shrestha came from the bench to put the result beyond doubt.
This game, after Nepal’s 6-2 loss against Iraq on May 29, showed Nepali fans hope that Nepal were capable of playing positive attacking football as they took advantage of the space left by the Iraqi side to score the goals. Most of the young players impressed but what caught the eyes of fans was how positively Nepal played.
Gone were the long hopeful balls as Almutairi’s side played with composure and confidence. Yes, there were times where players made mistakes resulting in goals (especially against Iraq), but their performance against Taipei was very positive.
Players were looking up and trying to pick out players who were taking runs, both in behind and out.
Most of the passes played by Nepal were on the ground as they looked to thread throw balls into runners who made ambitious runs behind the defence. Wide players also did a great job using the space as they created a lot of trouble for Chinese Taipei who were very poor that night.
That gave the fans a lot of hope as many were looking for a similar performance against Jordan. But, it was not to be. Nepal were shown how much they needed to improve to compete with the likes of Jordan.
Jordan started the match on the front foot, pestering Nepal with crosses and long-range efforts. Nepal dealt with them quite well until Rohit Chand conceded a sloppy penalty to give Jordan the lead. Despite Jordan’s continuous attack, Nepal kept them in the game hoping to hit them on the counter but had no luck as Jordan’s power and pace troubled Nepal throughout the half.
The second half was a similar show. Nepal conceded from Baha Faisal free-kick which put the game beyond Nepal’s sight. Yazan Al-Arab finished the game off heading home the third from yet another set-piece.
Nepal’s performance in this game was positive. Like against Iraq and Taipei, they played with a game plan to exploit spaces. But, against better teams, it does seem likely that the players need to execute the plan well.
“We played like Gorkhalis,” Almutairi said after the loss against Australia.
And, he was right. After Graham Roberts, Nepal have a coach with a character and an attitude. In a short time, Almutairi has put in a lot of effort as he is planning to build a team for the future. Even when put under pressure by the oppositions, Nepal’s team were not as fazed as they kept on playing positive football. For now, this is a good sign as the performances have been good even though the results have not happened so.
For that to happen, a lot of work on the training ground is needed and Almutairi knows that.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-in-world-cup-asian-cup-qualifiers-positive-performance-despite-negative-results-signals-hope.html,sports
Health Minister assures sportspersons of priority in Covid-19 vaccinations,"Wednesday, June 9, 2021","Kathmandu, June 9
Health and Population Minister Sher Bahadur Tamang says the government has put in priority sportspersons also as far as the Covid-19 vaccination drive is concerned.

Tamang said the government was working hard about how the treatment of other diseases could be made easy even during the Covid-19 pandemic.
On the occasion, the Nepal Sports Federation demanded that the government allocate at least 5,000 doses of vaccines to the players in Kathmandu and as many as necessary in other parts of the country.

Sandeep Lamichhane misses Vitality Blast due to visa delay,"Sunday, June 6, 2021","Kathmandu, June 6
Nepali leg-spinner and globetrotting T20 superstar Sandeep Lamichhane has pulled out of the Vitality Blast, a premier Twenty20 competition in England, scheduled to be held from June 9 due after failing to get a visa to leave Nepal.
Even though the tournament is over two months long, Lamichhane will miss out on it due to quarantine rules in the UK. With his visa process delayed, he was left with no choice but to pull out of the tournament as he would miss six to seven games of the tournament.
Lamichhane was scooped up by Worcestershire County for the T20 tournament, but now the team will replace him with New Zealand’s Ish Sodhi.
This is not the first time that he has had to face this issue. Last year, when he was due to play in the Caribbean Premier League, he faced a tough time getting a visa for the United States where a part of the tournament was being held. His visa was rejected initially, but after public outrage, he was granted the visa to take part in the tournament.
He tried to seek help this year in a similar manner, but all his efforts were to no avail as he had to leave Nepal by May 27 to take part in the tournament. However, as the British Embassy in Nepal does not grant visas and as all documents have to be sent to New Delhi’s British High Commissioner, the process never moved as swiftly as he wanted it to.
Talking about the issue via his Facebook page, Lamichhane said he was hurt and dejected after not being able to go play.
“The government doesn’t appreciate athletes like us,” he said talking to his fans via Facebook live.
Even though he did receive his visa on Friday, he tweeted that it was too late after he was released by the country for the tournament.
Lamichhane is still due to play in The Hundred, a 100-ball cricket tournament, due to start in England on July 21. He will play for the Oval Invincibles in the tournament. After that, he will also take part in the Caribbean Premier League representing the Trinbago Knight Riders.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sandeep-lamichhane-misses-vitality-blast-due-to-visa-delay.html,sports
Asia Cup qualifiers: Why Nepal’s new coach hopes against hope,"Wednesday, June 2, 2021","A new-look Nepal, led by an outspoken coach Abdullah Almutairi, have reached Kuwait to take part in the last round of fixtures of the World Cup and Asia Cup qualifiers. They will take on Chinese Taipei, Jordan and Australia.
To prepare for these tough matches in an unpleasant condition, Nepal took on Iraq on Saturday, losing by a scoreline of 6 goals to 2. The result, however, was expected as Almutairi had named a relatively young team full of debutants as he left out 13 players who had recently won the Three Nations Cup in March.
“I have announced a young team because I want them to learn,” said Almutairi at a press conference before leaving for Iraq. “If they lose now, they will learn and win in the future.”
This attitude has been hailed by football lovers in Nepal. But, if the team do any well against top opponents in hot and humid conditions is yet to be seen.
Nepal are currently in fourth position accumulating three points from five games in the qualifiers. Their only win in the qualifiers came against Chinese Taipei in September 2019 in Taiwan while they have lost the remaining four games without scoring a single goal.
If one goes by history, this does not look too good as Nepal have no chance of qualifying for the either the World Cup or the Asia Cup. But, coach Almuitari says that they will give it a go and will play progressive and positive football and trouble these opponents.
Their first match is against Chinese Taipei on Thursday. Nepal are the favourites to win this game, but with hot and humid conditions against them, Chinese Taipei will prove to be a tough test for an inexperienced side who have recently been trounced 6-2. But, Nepal on the other hand will want to bounce back from a loss where they made too many errors which led to the goals against them.
They will face Jordan next on June 7 which will be quite tough as they lost the previous game 3-0. With the conditions favouring Jordan, it is unlikely that Nepal will get anything out of the game. However, with a coach who is determined in playing attacking football and proving his naysayers wrong, there is a chance that Nepal might upset Jordan.
In the final match, they take against powerhouse Australia who are on the top of the group with 12 points and have conceded only one goal. When Nepal took on Australia in October 2019, they were bullied by the physique of the Australians who looked like scoring out of every set piece. And, given Nepal’s problem with dealing with crosses and set pieces in the recent friendly match against Iraq, if Almutairi does not address this in the team meetings, it is going to be a long night for Nepal.
With the World Cup qualification out of Nepal’s reach, their main aim now is to try to qualify for the 2023 Asia Cup. There are two ways they can do that.
The first is to finish the second or third. That is also unlikely as Jordan and Kuwait both have 10 points and are second and third respectively. But, with the two playing against each other, Nepal will have a chance if they win all three of their remaining games.
The other way Nepal can get to the final qualification round of the 2023 Asia Cup is by being one of the four best fourth-placed sides in the group stage. While the second and third will get a direct entry to the third qualifying round of the Asia Cup 2023, four out of eight best fourth-placed teams will also get a chance.
But, the road to Asia Cup is not easy. Nepal will have to get at least four points out of the nine available to be in contentions as it will have to hope that others drop points in order to take part in the Asia Cup for the first time.
Almutairi says that his aim goes beyond the SAFF Championship, a competition Nepal are yet to win. He says he wants to build a team for the future so that Nepal can compete with the best teams in Asia and go on to compete at the Asia Cup one day.
He is developing a team full of youngsters instilling a new philosophy where he wants his team to play brave, attacking football and not hide during matches.
It will be interesting to see how he lines up against Chinese Taipei and Jordan because if Nepal win these two matches, it will give them a great chance to compete in the 2023 Asia Cup.
Even if that does not happen, Nepal will have another shot at the third qualifying round by playing a playoff. But, playoff matches are full of pressure, which is why Almutairi is hoping that his team can do the job in the next three matches.

Yopesh Pradhan: Nepal’s pioneer sports live broadcaster looks forward to better days ahead,"Tuesday, June 1, 2021","Over 60,000 people on AP1 Sport’s YouTube channel watched Kathmandu Razyrs beat Dhangadhi FC in the final of Nepal Super League on May 15. A good number of people watched it on AP1 HD television as well. With people not being able to attend the match live due to the raging pandemic, it was crucial to the league’s success that the coverage was spot on. And, it was indeed.
At the forefront of this was Yopesh Pradhan, the tournament’s broadcast director, who was working day and night to ensure that people got to enjoy NSL from the comforts of their home.
“It feels good to have been part of this project. I feel we did a good job even when the circumstances were quite unfavourable,” says Pradhan. “But, I couldn’t have done it alone. I’m very proud of my team.”
Pradhan has been involved in the broadcasting scene for nearly two decades. He has worked live broadcasting events like the Dhangadhi Premier League, Everest Premier League, A Division Football, and the South Asian Games, to name a few. With the recently concluded NSL, he hopes to inspire a young batch of producers who want to help develop the sporting scene in Nepal.
“There is so much potential, we just need to tap into it,” he says.
Pradhan started his career at Kantipur Television as a camera person in 2002. Even though he shot everything, from politics to protest to music shows, his passion was sports.
“I used to go cover all sporting events, from football to cricket to volleyball. Even though I had only one camera, I’d try to get shots from different angles so that we could give the audience a more dynamic coverage.”
With a young team that included Aman Adhikari and Sudin Pokharel, and a liberal management team, Pradhan got to experiment a lot. He along with Adhikari started a show called Showboard which dealt with all things sports and was quite popular in Nepal during the 2000s.
His work at Kantipur TV raised his stock as he started to get gigs elsewhere. The first was Sajha Sawal, a panel discussion show produced by BBC Media Action. There he worked as a cameraperson but soon ended up in the outside broadcasting (OB) van switching between cameras for the live broadcast of the show.
“It was fun to have been involved in the project. I learnt a lot there,” he says.
He grew into it and wanted to be part of sports broadcasting projects. But, with most rights elsewhere, and bosses at Kantipur TV not too keen on broadcasting live sports, he left his job there and went to the US, accompanying his wife for her higher studies in 2010.
“Working at Kantipur was fun, but at that point, I needed a new project,” he says.
He was still eager to learn more about production. As he was based in New York, he enrolled in a short diploma course in digital filmmaking at the prestigious New York Film Academy. There, he sharpened his skills having involved himself in various projects.
“I wanted to a specific course on camera which would have been more fruitful, but it was too expensive,” he adds.
After spending a few years there, he returned and started to work on various filming projects and helped out at G21 Productions. In 2015, he then got a call from AP1 asking if he was interested to lead the television company’s camera crew.
“I’d worked with many of the before so I jumped at the opportunity.”
Pradhan, who had made a name for himself in Nepal’s live broadcast scene, would end up at almost all live events the TV channel would air.
“I’d be everywhere, from political interviews to live protests. I enjoyed it very much.”
Things started to get even better for him as AP1 started to bid for sports broadcasting rights. The first was the A Division League which soon paved the way for other events like the Dhandadhi Premier League and Everest Premier League.
“I finally got to do something I had always wanted to do. Even though it was hard initially, my and the people I worked with learnt on the job as we pulled it off.”
Live broadcasting was a rare sight in Nepal as it was limited to major sporting events like the South Asian Games or the SAFF Championships. Even major cricket games were rarely shown on the TV due to a lack of equipment and skilled human resources.
His first major project came in the form of the Dhangadhi Premier League. As he did not have a replay machine and skilled camera persons, he was afraid how it would turn out. But, as the TV had already taken the rights, he had no option but to go to Dhangadhi and broadcast it.
“It was a disaster, but we learnt a lot. We didn’t show replay and the score had to be put in from Kathmandu,” he says. “We even had to install Dish Home at our tent in the ground to see if what we were doing was coming out okay on the TV.”
But, gradually things got better as he got better with live broadcasting. In 2017, the TV brought a replay machine which helped Pradhan and his team a lot.
Things became better for Pradhan when he was part of the broadcasting team for the ACC Premier League which took place in Kathmandu in 2017.
“As it was also being broadcasted on Sony Max, people from India had come to broadcast it. I learnt a lot working with them. Those 15 days were the best as I worked with a few people who were involved in broadcasting the IPL. Time spent during then was invaluable.”
Live broadcasting is full of its fair challenges. The initial challenge he says is the lack of proper equipment in the country. While things have changed and a few TV channels and companies have brought in some good equipment, they still require committed and skilled human resources.
“We train people, but most go away because these live events are quite rare. Plus, people here in Nepal are not all supporting and it does get quite discouraging.”
He gives a recent example where they were getting a lot of hate comments on YouTube about the broadcasting of the NSL. There were complaints about everything, from picture quality to the lack of replays. While some were constructive, a lot of comments were full of malice.
“People were talking like the NSL needed VAR (video assistant referee). They think it’s easy to do it without paying any attention to what type of technology it is.”
But, he is hopeful that things are changing. Since he has started off, a lot has already changed and with more enthusiastic people interested in live broadcasting, he thinks the future is bright.
“We have young people like Abhinav (Joshi) and Avash (Ghimire) who are new to this but are always willing to learn. If we have young people with the right attitude working in sports broadcasting, Nepal’s sporting scene will also develop and that what we want to do in the long run.”

Know 6 new members of Nepal’s national football team,"Friday, May 21, 2021","On Tuesday, Abdullah Almutairi, the head coach of the men’s national football team of Nepal, announced a 23-member squad for the upcoming friendly match against Iraq and the remaining three matches of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. Almutairi finalised this team by axing nine players from the 32 players included in the preliminary training.
This reshuffled squad includes six new faces whereas 10 players of the Three Nations Cup-winning team last April have also made the cut. Likewise, Nawayug Shrestha, Santosh Tamang, Pujan Uparkoti, Bikas Khawas, and Suman Aryal, who failed to make it to the team in the Three Nations Cup, have been called back. Suman Lama and Ashish Lama have also rejoined the team.
Almutairi has left out some of the popular players like Bharat Khawas, Ranjit Dhimal while giving opportunities to the young players in this team on the basis of their performance in the first season of the Nepal Super League held from April 24 to May 15.
Bishal Sunar, Gautam Shrestha, Kamal Thapa, Ayush Ghalan, Suraj Thakuri, and Manish Dangi are those new young players who have made it to the senior team for the first team.
Let’s know each of them better:
Sunar has played for various national youth teams, such as the under-16 and under-18 national teams. He was also called for training for the Three Nations Cup in the national camp but failed to make it to the final squad. Still, his participation in that training opened a new opportunity; he was listed in the A category for the NSL and thus was contracted by FC Chitwan for Rs 200,000.
He played five games for the club. In his first NSL match itself, he saved a penalty from Lalitpur City Fc’s captain Anjan Bista. But, he was sent off in the fifth match, which was against Pokhara Thunders, with a red card.
In the past, he had played for Brigade Boys Club in the A Division League. Similarly, he also played for Manang Marsyangdi in the Aaha Rara Gold Cup in Pokhara.
In the NSL, Shrestha played for Pokhara Thunders. Before the NSL, he played for Jawalakhel Youth club in the A Division League last time and also for Tribhuvan Army Football Club in the AFC Cup Qualifiers. Likewise, he has also played a friendly match as a national team member against Kyrgyzstan’s U-23 team.
In the NSL, he played four out of six games of the team, three full time. His excellent performance in the NSL landed him a position in the national squad.
Thapa, who has already played in the national youth teams, also played for Pokhara Thunders in the NSL. He replaced Bhishan Gurung in the team and got the opportunity to play only the last three games of the league. Although he spent only a short time on the field as an alternate player, he managed to impress head coach Almutairi.
In domestic football, he played in the A Division League for Himalayan Sherpa. He is the batchmate of Anjan Bista, Bimal Gharti Magar and Ananta Tamang at the ANFA Academy.
Ghalan, whose name was rarely heard of in domestic football before the NSL, won the hearts of many by his excellent performance in the recent league. He also played for Pokhara Thunders in the NSL. Though he only played for six minutes in his debut match, he became the first-choice in the remaining five NSL matches.
Before the NSL, he played for Khumalatar FC in the B Division League this season. In a short span, he succeeded in making his place in the national team.
Suraj Thakuri played for Biratnagar City FC in the NSL. Entering the ground as a substitute in the opening game, he played the last three games as a first-choice full-time midfielder. His performance overshadowed many great players in the NSL.
Before this league, he played for Jawalakhel Youth Club  in the A Division League .
Dangi also played for Biratnagar City in the NSL. He had earlier played in the C Division League and also played in the SAFF U-18 Championship in Nepal.

Kushal Bhurtel: Nepal cricket’s humble underdog stole the limelight quite late. What next?,"Wednesday, April 28, 2021","Nepal’s batting has been historically weak. Whatever the reason might be, rarely had Nepal or a Nepali batsman performed well in any international tournament in the past.
There had been constant changes in the opening slot as different coaches tried various combinations to solve the issue. But, nothing changed. Nepal’s openers continued to fail, which put immense pressure on the middle order, which normally would crumble under pressure.
But, things changed in the recent Tri-Nation T20I Series held in Kathmandu in April. Nepal’s showing with the bat impressed everyone, even coach Dav Whatmore. Nepal, who were without their talisman Paras Khadka, played with confidence and swagger like never before.
They were brave with the bat as they left both Malaysia and Netherlands’ bowlers scratching their head as to what to do. At the centre of this was one man – opener Kushal Bhurtel who scored four half-centuries in five matches, including a world record of three back-to-back half-centuries in his first three international innings.
“I’ve always been an aggressive cricketer,” says the 24-year-old. “The plan was to play smart aggressive cricket and help the team win. Having done that, I’m quite happy.”
This aggressiveness gave him fame that he had not imagined at this stage of his career, but the humble man wants to do more.
For Bhurtel, the journey has been long and full of ups and downs. Born in Butwal, he was always playing one sport or the other that included cricket.
By the time he was 14, he was taking part in local tournaments impressing local selectors which opened the doors to the regional U-16 team.
“By then, my love for the game had become so strong, it started to become an obsession.”
But, he knew that he had to work hard, and that is what he did. He continued to work on his game and, in 2016, made it into Nepal’s U-19 team that consisted of the likes of Sandeep Lamichhane, Dipendra Singh Airee and Aarif Sheikh.
He batted as low as number eight in the batting order as he was used mostly for his power-hitting late in the innings. Nepal did quite well in the tournament and a lot of these players ended up being contracted by the departmental team Nepal Police Club later.
“A lot of us from that team play for Nepal Police. It feels good to be part of that team.”
His road to the national team has not been easy as he has had to wait a long time to make his debut. Even though he has always been close to the team, he was never given the chance. Teenagers played ahead of him, but he did not lose hope. He continued to work on his game and weakness.
It was not until the Pokhara Premier League that he started to open. A lot of credit should go to Sharad Vesawkar who promoted the young Bhurtel to open the innings. But, Bhurtel did not perform as well as he would have liked in both editions of the PPL.
But, he continued to open in the camps and started to work on his batting against the new ball. His confidence in his ability meant he was even trusted to open the batting for the Nepal Police Club in the PM and Mayor Cup 50-over tournaments.
That put him in the eye of newly appointed coach Dav Whatmore. Whatmore is a coach who has a history of giving new players a chance and instil confidence in them.
Either one of Bhurtel and fellow debutant Aasif Sheikh was sure to open along with Paras Khadka, but with Khadka pulling out of the series due to an injury, it gave the coach the chance to see how both Bhurtel and Sheikh would fare against international bowlers.
“I was quite anxious when I knew I’d open. But, I knew what to do. We had trained hard in the camps and knew that if we did what we did in the camps, we’d win.”
He also gives a lot of credit to Whatmore who, he says, believed in his ability and asked him to play fearlessly.
“He knew that my power play is good and asked me to be aggressive from the start. If we did that, the middle order would have it easy.”
And, aggressively he played. He showed the bowlers no respect as he smashed 278 runs in five matches winning the player of the series in the process and creating a new record.
But, to him, that was just a footnote as he believes that winning as a team is more important than personal records.
“Our seniors have worked very hard to get us here. We just want to carry on making people proud and keep on winning as our goal is to play world cups,” he says.
He also wants to thank his father for always believing in him. He says that if not for his and his family’s support, he would never have made it to where he is today.
“He used to tell me exams can be taken next year and ask me to concentrate on cricket. Without this kind of support, I’d have never made it. I’m extremely thankful for his constant motivation and support.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kushal-bhurtel-nepal-cricket.html,sports

The Netherlands have beaten Nepal by three wickets with three balls to spare at the Tri-nation T20I Series in TU Cricket Ground on Tuesday.
Batting first, Nepal put up a commendable score of 206 for 6 in their allotted 20 overs. Kushal Bhurtel, who had scored two half-centuries in a row, top-scored with 62 as he became the first-ever player to score three T20I half-centuries in his first three games. He was supported by captain Gyanendra Malla who scored 20 while vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee scored a quickfire 60.
In reply, the Netherlands were aggressive from the start. Even though they lost openers Max O’Dowd and Tobais Visee early, middle-order batsmen Ben Cooper and Bas de Leede took control of the match as both scored half-centuries.
The game looked to turn Nepal’s way as Cooper threw away his wicket to Sandeep Lamichhane for 55, but Leede took the game away from Nepal as he took on all Nepali bowlers, including Lamichhane, as he scored an unbeaten 81 of 42 balls.
Lamichhane was the pick of the bowlers for Nepal as he took four wickets giving away 48 runs.
With this, Nepal and the Netherlands have the same points, but Nepal are ahead in the table thanks to their superior run rate.

"Nishma Shrestha: Grabbing medals one after other, this lady inspires female cyclists in Nepal","Wednesday, April 7, 2021","Nishma Shrestha’s day starts by gazing at the gold medal she won at the Women’s Cycling Downhill event at the South Asian Games in 2019. For the 25-year-old, that is more than just a medal. It is a reminder of seven years of hard work and sacrifices along with greater things that are in store for her if she continues to work hard.
“It feels great to look at it early in the morning,” she says. “I feel proud of what I have achieved so far. I feel I have come a long way.”
Having taken part in over 60 races and won things in a sport that rarely sees female athletes, she now hopes that she can inspire a young batch of female cyclists who can challenge the stereotype and compete with the best in the world like her male counterparts have done in past few years.
Born in Kathmandu, Shrestha had a low-key childhood. She was shy and introverted and never really had any liking for the outdoors. But, that slowly changed. By the time she was in her teens, she started to develop a love for cycling thanks to her family.
“My father was an outdoor person as was my mamma. Both of them helped me get into cycling,” she says.
By the time she was 14, she regularly accompanied her uncle to Mudkhu Bhanjyang, a hub for mountain bikers in Kathmandu. There she saw the biking community who were friendly, welcoming and, most importantly, encouraging.
“Every time I cycled there, I started to develop a love for the sport. It grew on me. It was hard at the beginning, but the satisfaction I got when I reached the destination made me crave for Saturdays.”
Encouragement from the community and her family built confidence in her as she started to cycle regularly. Things got even better when her dad, who is also a mountain biking enthusiast, bought a mountain bike to go to Langtang in 2013. After he returned, she started to go out regularly on the bike. Mudkhu, which is five kilometres away from her house in Goldhunga on the northern outskirts of Kathmandu, started to become her second home.
“The people there have always been encouraging. They always told me how I should take part in races and events as there aren’t many women in the sport and be that person who can help change that.”
There, she learnt about different types of events that took place in mountain biking. First, she was told about cross-country, then it was stage races and finally downhill, which was taking its baby steps in Nepal.
“Downhill always appealed to me more.”
By the time she finished the 10th grade, she knew what she wanted to do. Having seen her passion, her parents also let her do what she wanted to do. In a bid to get better, she regularly cycled to and from her high school. After completing high school, she even took a year off to focus on her one true love – mountain biking.
“I’m glad they saw my passion and let me do that. I’m very thankful towards my parents.”
Her first solo race was Showdown Dharan in 2015 in which she stood second. The same year, she even went to the Himalayan Mountain Bike Festival in Manali, India, taking part in the open category.
“Not winning these events lit a fire in me. I was ambitious. I started training more because I wanted to become the best.”
In 2016, she tried something different. Having heard a lot about downhill races, she took part in one during the Himalayan Outdoor Festival. This is the first time that a Nepali female had taken part in the competition. She did not win, as she had to compete in the open category, but she won a lot of fans and plaudits.
“A downhill rider is seen differently. It’s tough and requires a lot of practice and balance.”
Downhill races call for speeding down rough and steep trails where cyclists have to manoeuvre their bikes on narrow tracks against rock gardens, and the trails feature extremely sharp turns, treacherous surfaces and numerous other hurdles.
That year, she realised that she needed extra training and started practising even more. Tarebhir in Shivapuri became her practice trail along with Khokona and Nagarkot. She says she calls downhill a science rather than art as one has to study angles as they have never before if they want to do downhill rides.
Also in 2016, she started to take part in national games too, but again due to lack of women, she took part mostly in the open category. That gave her confidence to take part in the 2017 Enduro Series.
The first year was more a learning experience while her second year, 2018, was the year she announced her to the mountain biking world.
Taking part in the three-part race held in Nepal, Malaysia and Thailand, Shrestha won the series as she was at the podium in races in all three countries (3rd in Nepal and Thailand and 1st in Malaysia).
That paved her way to take part in the South Asian Games in 2019. Even though not many female cyclists had taken part before, this time a lot more had participated. As the national champion, she qualified and trained with four others and took part in the SAG held in Nepal.
With the belief that she would win, she competed in the downhill race winning it comfortably. She won gold while her teammate Jamuna Thapa won silver.
“It’s a day I will never forget,” she says.
But now, the challenge to stay there is tough, she says. This is why she still trains for two hours every day. She says that she wants to improve herself and become even better at downhills.
During the tourist season, she also does some guiding as most in the mountain biking scene sustain themselves through it.
“It’s good money and I also quite enjoy doing this. I get to learn things and technique and enjoy the company of some great female riders who I get to meet along the way.”
For the future, her plan is to continue in the sport and help the future generation. While the sport is getting better for males, for females, she says, things are not as great. She says that many find it hard to stay in the sport for long due to various obligations including family pressure, there is also a feeling that the sport has not reached out to more women.
“There are a lot of young boys coming through. They are fearless and confident and skilful. For females, it’s sad to say that the sport is still far away from that. I don’t know why but females are quite reluctant. I hope that it changes in the future.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nishma-shrestha-nepal-young-female-cyclist.html,sports

7 best swimming pools in Kathmandu,"Sunday, April 4, 2021","Summer is nearly upon us. As the temperatures rise, the urge to jump into a pool must be on a lot of people’s mind because a dip in a swimming pool is as therapeutic as it is refreshing.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all swimming pools and sports-related activities were put on hold. But, with the vaccination being rolled out and the number of cases going down, it is likely that people will be putting on their swimsuits and jump into a swimming pool near them.
Here, we bring to you a list of popular swimming pools across the Kathmandu valley where you can go cool down when it gets hot:
This is arguably the best swimming pool in Kathmandu. It is clean and huge, and with the amenities available, once you swim here, you will struggle to find a better place. It has a pool for children and another one for adults, which means you can take the kids and spend the day there. Even though it is a bit expensive, it is ideal if you are going with the family as it also offers a buffet lunch, which if you want can be bought in a package with the pool service.
The national complex is great if you want to swim in an Olympic-size pool. The water is normally clean, but it is quite crowded. If you are with the family and want to avoid the crowd, avoid the pool on weekends. If it is just you and your mates going for a dip, you can jump from one of their podiums. Make sure you have prior experience because things can go horribly wrong.
It is a small pool, but for people from that area, it is quite an idea. Usually, the place is packed during weekends, so if you want to avoid crowds, it is best you go during the weekdays and if possible, in the evening. The pool, even though small, has a kids section as well. Monthly packages at the centre are quite good and if interested, it also has a family package.
The infinity pool at Hotel Shambala is arguably the valley’s prettiest swimming pool. It is not deep, but its length is good enough for a few laps on it. Overlooking the sun setting down on the west and the Kathmandu valley to the south and north is a feeling that you will cherish for years to come.
It is another infinity pool, but compared to Shambala, it is small. But again, the view on offer from here is quite breathtaking. It is a bit expensive, but with the services on offer, you will surely be back for more.
This is another budget swimming pool that is ideal for both kids and adults. It has got good teachers too. Right next to the futsal, the place is generally deserted during the evenings which makes it great for a dip before dinner.
It is one of the oldest and the busiest swimming pools in the country. Before Covid-19, it saw a huge number of people on a regular basis, but the number of people might be low post-pandemic. It offers lessons to those who cannot swim and probably has the best lifeguards on duty too. With a gym and sauna, the value that this place offers is second to none.
Even though it does not have a swimming pool, the organisation teaches swimming to both children and adults. It also teaches swimming to differently-abled persons. If interested, give it a call and ask when and where their next lesson is taking place. You can do that by visiting its website.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/best-swimming-pools-in-kathmandu.html,sports
"A review of Biraj Maharjan, Nepal’s most successful football captain’s career","Wednesday, March 31, 2021","Biraj Maharjan warmed up at Dasharath Stadium on Monday, with a heavy heart. Having played 72 times for Nepal, captaining them 18 times, this was going to be his last match. As he came on for Tridev Gurung, in the 89th minute of the game, for the 73rd time, he looked emotional. Why wouldn’t he be? His career with the national team was coming to an end after 13 years.
As he came onto the pitch, the crowd gave him a standing ovation while his teammates gave him the captain’s armband. Everyone who followed Nepali football knew how much this moment meant to him.
“I feel extremely lucky to have been able to live my dream. To walk out with a win in my final game at home with the crowd cheering was special,” he said.
Maharjan started his football career when he joined the All Nepal Football Association’s football academy in 2000. Since then, he has never looked back as he represented Nepal in all age groups, winning things along the way.
Making his debut against Pakistan in 2008 at Pokhara Stadium aged 18, he then became a regular starter for Nepal at left-back. His commanding presence and versatility meant he was the first name on the team sheet. Having made his debut, he soon got on the score sheet as he scored his one and only international goal against Kyrgyzstan during the AFC Challenge Cup in March 2009.
In 2015, he captained Nepal for the first time against India and by 2016, he became Nepal’s most successful captain winning three international tournaments in a year that included a gold medal at the South Asian Games held in Guwahati, India. Along with that, he also led Nepal to victories in the Bangabandhu Gold Cup and the AFC Solidarity Cup in Malaysia.
That success, however, did not last as Nepal’s record since then has not been great. Even though in 2018, he beat Raju Kaji Shakya’s appearance record, Maharjan’s form dipped and has been in and out of the national team since 2019.
He had been winning league titles in Nepal, but his performances did not really appeal to then coaches Gyotoku Koji and Johan Kalin. Prior to Monday’s appearance, Maharjan last played for Nepal in a friendly match against Malaysia in June 2019.
However, leading Machhindra Club to their first league title, Maharjan made a comeback in the national team just in time for the Three Nations Cup in which he, until the final, played little to no part.
But, he knew that would happen. Speaking before the tournament, Maharjan had said that he was going to retire to give the younger generation a chance to represent Nepal.
“I’m not getting young and with football at home a rarity, I feel that now is the right time to retire. If I can go out by winning a trophy in my final game, that would be great,” he had said before the tournament started.
That is exactly what he did. He went out in the best way possible. Winning a trophy at home with a partially packed Dasharath Stadium chanting his name is something he had always dreamt of. Carrying Maharjan on their shoulders, the team also paid homage to one of Nepali football’s best players.
Putting on the blazer offered to him but PM KP Sharma Oli, he left the stadium with a bright smile on his face knowing that this, even though looks like the end, is in fact the start of something bigger.
“You’ll see me in the football field,” he said.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/a-review-of-biraj-maharjan-nepals-most-successful-football-captains-career.html,sports
Nepal beat Bangladesh to win first trophy at home in 37 years,"Monday, March 29, 2021","Kathmandu, March 29
At a gloomy yet jubilant Dasharath Stadium, Nepal beat Bangladesh 2-1 to win the Three Nations Cup held in Kathmandu on Monday. With this, Nepal’s senior team have won a trophy at home for the first time in 37 years.
Starting on the front foot, Nepal piled up the pressure from the opening whistle. All of their opening pressure paid off as Sanjog Rai, starting his second match for Nepal, opened the scoring in the 18th minute with a low driven left-footed shot, after a poor clearance by the Bangladeshi defenders following a corner by Sunil Bal. This broke Nepal’s seven-match streak without a goal.
Bangladesh, having gone behind, tried to come back into the game as they created a few chances testing Nepal’s keeper Kiran Kumar Limbu, whose misjudgement nearly cost Nepal a goal.
However, after continued pressure, Nepal bagged another goal as Bishal Rai scored in the 42nd minute with a composed finish following a pass from Sanjog.
Nepal could have scored a few more goals as Ananta Tamang and Anjan Bista both missed great chances to put Nepal further forward.
Nepal started the second like they started the first as they piled on the pressure creating chances throughout the half. Dominating possession, Nepal controlled the game quite well. But, a lack of defensive awareness in the 82nd minute gave Bangladesh a sniff back in the game as an unmarked Mahbubur Rahman Sufil scored from a corner.
After scoring, Bangladesh tried to pile up the pressure with regular long balls and set pieces, but Nepal held on to win the final and with it the Three Nations Cup that included Kyrgyzstan’s U23 team.
Sanjog Rai was judged the player of the match for his goal and assist while Rohit Chand was judged the tournament’s most valuable player.
Captain Biraj Maharjan, who is Nepal’s most capped player, played his last game for Nepal as he had already declared he would take retirement from the international football after this event.

"Gaurika Singh: Despite pandemic, Nepal’s young swimming sensation is working hard to grab next medals","Monday, March 22, 2021","Gaurika Singh, at Best Venue’s enclosed swimming pool, is putting in lap after lap. First, she works on her freestyle, then backstroke. With motivation and determination, for the next two hours, she relentlessly works on her weaknesses.
Not being able to swim in the United Kingdom due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Singh, Nepal’s young swimming sensation living in the UK with her parents, flew to Nepal in mid-February with one aim – practising for the Tokyo Olympics where she aims to better her personal record and try to beat the national record.
With National Sports Council’s swimming coach Ongden Lama, Singh trains two hours every day at Best Venue in Kalopul which has become a home for national swimmers in the winter ever since Satdobato’s pool was demolished for repair.
“Training is going well. I feel really grateful to swim again,” she says. “Initially due to Kathmandu being at a higher altitude than the UK, it was tough. But gradually, I’ve acclimatised and am getting better.”
Her preparations for Tokyo 2020 were going great. Since winning four gold medals at the South Asian Games in December 2019, her confidence was up as she was aiming towards getting that national record to her name.
But as the pandemic spread across the world, England, like Nepal, went into lockdown. Everything shut down, from shopping malls to schools to training centres and Singh, who swam every day, was confined to staying at home.
“It’s understandable because this is a pandemic,” she says. “People have had to go through worse.”
As cases were rising, swimming clubs in the UK shut down from March 2020. The pools continued to remain shut throughout the spring and only reopened around August 2020. As the pools reopened, she had started to swim again, but as cases rose, pools were shut again in November.
“Only outdoor pools were open. And, swimming outdoors in the winter in the UK is not possible.”
That is why Singh along with her mother and brother came to Nepal to train. Coach Lama says that as she had a four-month break, he is only working on her basic endurance for now and get her flow back to what it was again.
“As her endurance improves and we up the intensity of the training, we will start to record her time, which has gotten better,” he says.
Another reason Singh says she has come to Nepal is swimming in high altitudes, which is tough. But, she hopes it will help her perform in low-altitude areas.
“It produces a lot of red blood cells which helps when swimming in low-altitude areas as it increases performance level,” she says.
Even though she is here, Singh is in constant contact with her coach in the UK with whom she discusses swimming routines and weekly plans.
But as she is only 18 and is on the verge of completing her A-levels, she does have a lot on her plate. Apart from swimming, she also has online classes which take up most of her day along with homework.
“I spend my days, training at the pool, doing homework and online classes,” she says. “Along with that, I also do a bit of weight training to build my strength.”
When asked if she feels any pressure after winning golds at the South Asian Games, she says she is not fazed by and as she has grown older, she has learnt how to control her nerves in tense situations.
“I’m quite young now and athletes like me peak around our mid-20s, so for now I’m not too worried,” she says. “Since Rio 2016, I’ve matured a lot mentally and that is what’s important. Along with that, I’ve also gotten better as a swimmer as my times have improved by 6 seconds in freestyle.”
She is heading to the Tokyo Olympics with a positive frame of mind as her only goal, for now, is to better her personal time.
After spending a little over a month in Nepal, Singh is going back to the UK to appear in her final exams. Then, she will spend time with her coach in a bit to better her time before she heads to Tokyo to represent Nepal in the Olympics.
“When I was in Rio, it was very overwhelming. This year, I hope I can enjoy a bit more.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gaurika-singh-despite-pandemic-nepals-young-swimming-sensation-is-working-hard-to-grab-next-medals.html,sports
Nepal footballers to play remaining World Cup Qualifier games in Kuwait,"Friday, March 12, 2021","Kathmandu, March 12
The Asian Football Federation has announced that Nepal will play the remaining matches under the Asian Qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and AFC Asian Cup China 2023 in Kuwait.
Earlier on March 2, citing Covid-19-related restrictions, the AFC had said the matches would take place in a centralised venue without confirming the venue.
But, in a release issued on Friday, the AFC said all Group B matches would be held in Kuwait between May 31 and June 15.

Women’s Day: Equal pay is a far cry from reality for Nepal’s sportswomen,"Sunday, March 7, 2021","On December 10, 2020, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), Nepali football’s governing body, decided to pay an equal salary to both men and women national team members. Everyone from the sporting industry lauded this historic decision as this was the first time equal pay was implemented in Nepal.
The women footballers had been getting salaries since 2011, but the pay gap was huge. They were paid only Rs 5,000, the half a man footballer would get every month. That increased to Rs 7,000 in 2015, but it was still Rs 8,000 lower than what men earnt even though the women played as many matches as the men did.
“The disparity was quite a lot, which is why we are quite content with the December decision,” says Sabitra Bhandari, a forward of Nepal’s football team. “We both train for a similar amount of time and play for a similar amount so for us, this is something to be happy about.”
Even though football set a good example, equal pay in sports is still a far cry from reality in Nepal. Football remains the only sport to support equal pay. Other sporting bodies have hardly discussed it, let alone implemented it. This, players say, is demotivating and demeaning to the amount of effort they put to represent Nepal internationally. Gender pay disparity has been a global issue and in the world of sports, many of late have been advocating for bridging the gap.
That is not all, apart from football, only cricket pays salaries to its players irrespective of gender. While it started paying men in 2015, women only started received salaries as recently as September 2020.
“Of course it hurts, but for now, we are content with what we are getting,” says Rubina Chhetri, captain of Nepal’s women cricket team. “We are content for now because we have only recently started receiving salaries. It’s a start for now.”
Having played for Nepal for a decade, cricketers like Chhetri got nothing in return. All they received was match fees from various tournaments and prize money if they won it. But, the Cricket Association of Nepal’s decision to award them central contracts of Rs 15,000, Rs 12,000 and Rs 10,000, respectively has been taken positively for now.
But, with men earning nearly three times more, Chhetri says, equal pay, for now, is wishful thinking.
“Nepal is a result-based country,” she says. “I think the difference between us and the men is they have won a few tournaments and recently achieved the ODI status, which is quite huge. If we win and keep on winning, I’m sure this issue will also be resolved.”
Chhetri, however, does say that they have been talking to CAN about increasing the salary as it just is not enough to sustain themselves. The money, she says, cannot even buy a proper bat, let alone help a play sustain herself for a month.
“For now, we thank CAN and appreciate their effort, but, we have told them that this isn’t enough,” Chhetri.
While footballers and cricketers are getting salaries, other sports like basketball, volleyball, karate, and taekwondo are not. This makes it extremely difficult for many as they rely on tournament prize money and a basic daily stipend.
“We’ve been playing for the love of the game and because we are passionate about it,” says Pratibha Mali, a member of Nepal’s national volleyball team. “We don’t even expect them to pay us so when we think about equal pay, it’s quite far away.”
Expectation of sportswomen is quite low in all sports.
One sportswoman, who did not want to be named, says that not being paid is one of the reasons Nepali sport has never made a significant impact. She says while men avoid doing anything at home, women, on the other hand, also have to help out at home due to social constraints.
“These age-old stereotypes are pointless and need rectifying. Getting paid equally obviously needs to happen if you play an equal number of games, but this issue goes beyond that,” she says.
Many sportswomen also share that equal pay is only possible if there are enough women in leadership roles. With fewer voices at the top, not much is going to change, believe these women.
Romee Giri, who recently completed her master’s dissertation on gender equality in sports organisations in Nepal, says her research showed that people who have reached decision-making posts in such organisations are not due to their ability but due to the ‘infamous’ quota system.
“What my research found was a lot of women who are in these positions are there because they have been compelled to join the organisations. While there are a few who are capable of leading these organisations, a few have women who would rather be anywhere else,” says Giri.
Giri says that these women face a lot of social and organisational challenges, due to which they are scared to take risks when it comes to decision making.
But, there is hope. The manager at Nepal Volleyball Association, Rita Koirala, says that even though the association does not offer salaries to players, it has ensured that both men and women compete for the same prize money at tournaments.
“We don’t have the money to pay for players. It is a harsh reality of Nepali sports. It’s quite sad that Nepal’s national game can’t pay its players,” Koirala says, “But, we have started to make sure that there is no difference in the prize money, which is good.” She believes more women need to come forward and stake their claim when it comes to leadership positions in sports federations.
ANFA’s central committee member, Pema Lama, echoes Koirala on this issue. She, like Koirala, is the solo woman in the central committee of her association and says talks are being held to include more women so that they can voice their concerns regarding women issues.
“We have to come forward and talk about things. I can’t take the credit for equal pay in football entirely, but its because there was a woman that issues like this was heard.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/womens-day-equal-pay-is-a-far-cry-for-nepals-sportswomen.html,sports
Nepal-Australia football match scheduled for March 30 in limbo,"Tuesday, March 2, 2021","Kathmandu, March 2
Nepal’s football match with Australia under the Asian Qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and AFC Asian Cup China 2023 have also been pushed into limbo as the Asian Football Federation did not include the match in its latest announcement.
The match was scheduled to be held at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on March 30. However, in an AFC statement issued today, it has scheduled two matches for the day, but nothing is mentioned about the Nepal-Australia event. It is, hence, highly likely that the match will not be held that day in Kathmandu.
On the other hand, an Australian football news site, Socceroos has claimed the AFC has already confirmed the match involving Australia will take place in a centralised format between May 31 and June 15.

"Saru Limbu began playing football barefoot. Today, she has a bigger dream for her nation","Friday, February 26, 2021","Saru Limbu, 21, was in raptures when she won the best player award in the National Women’s League as an Armed Police Force player on February 19. She had had a great season as she capped it off with two goals in the final game against Tribhuvan Army in a 3-0 victory.
With Sabtira Bhandari ‘Samba’, who had scored 43 goals, injured, many had felt that the Army would put an end to the APF’s unbeaten run. But, Limbu stole the show in the victory as she won the most valuable player of the tournament ahead of ‘goal machine’ Bhandari.
“It was quite surprising,” says Limbu. “I knew I would win an award, but I thought it would be a small one like the best midfielder.  But, when Bimala Chaudhary from the Army won the best midfielder and Bhandari won the best forward, I started to dream.”
Having done well in the league this year, she now wants to do more and has her eyes set on glory with the national team. As she missed out on the final of an under-age SAFF championship due to the 2015 earthquake, she now wants to win one with the senior team. And, she wants to do that by beating Nepal’s nemesis India in the finals.
Limbu’s footballing career started in Morang. As a child growing up, she regularly watched football matches with her friends and cousins. Even though at first she was sceptical about playing football, gradually, she started to get accustomed to it.
One day, her school teacher saw her play football wearing a skirt. She was playing really well and that impressed her teachers who then called Bikram Dhimal, a football coach. Dhimal then decided to take Limbu under his wing and took her to Urlabari.
To play football, she needed boots. She asked her brother to buy one for her and then left for Urlabari to train.
“It took me two weeks to play a game. When I started playing, it felt odd initially as I didn’t know much,” she says, “I barely touched the ball and was running around like a headless chicken. When I did touch the ball and hit a shot, my shoes tore,” she says.
She played the remainder of that match barefoot. That is not it, she says she played a lot of games barefoot as she could not ask her parents to buy her shoes. She even sewed the torn shoes and played with them countless times.
She was doing well too. Impressed at local level tournaments, she was catching the eyes of various clubs. One of them was the APF.
Initially, her family did not want her to go. But, as it was a departmental team where she would have more than just a football job, her family agreed.
When Limbu joined the APF, it already had a number of talents like Anu Lama and Sajana Rana. But, with both Lama and Rana injured, Limbu got a chance to play as soon as she joined the club.
“I was quite lucky,” she says.
She garbed the opportunity with both hands as she garnered a lot of praise when she lit up the Chief of Army Staff Cup. That got her a ticket to Nepal’s national team.
After consistently performing well both at the club level and at the closed camps, she booked a place in Nepal’s 2016 SAFF Championship team.
“I went home with the national team jersey with my name on it and stared at it for hours,” she says. “It was one of the proudest moment of my life.”
Her debut for the national team was against Sri Lanka. She was anxious. All that she had worked for in her life was coming true.
“I came on in the second half. I wasn’t sure if I could compete with them, but it was a good first game, which we won thanks to an own goal from Sri Lanka.”
But, in the semi-final, Nepal lost to hosts India and with that, Limbu’s debut tournament ended in disappointment.
Then came the 13th South Asian Games in 2019 when she scored her first goal against Sri Lanka. To her, it was a special moment as she scored in a game in which Nepal was struggling.
“I was shocked when I scored,” she says. “I didn’t even know how to celebrate. Samba didi [Sabitra Bhandari] pulled me and hugged me as we celebrated the goal.”
Limbu was hopeful about winning a gold medal at the SAG. But as Nepal lost to India again, that dream all but remained a dream.
Every time Nepal have reached the finals of either the SAFF Championship or the SAG, each time they have lost to India.
Why do they always lose to India? This question has plagued almost all the players. But none of them has an answer.
“Every time we play them, we try our best. Give our all. But, we always end up losing,” says Limbu.
But, Limbu and others have not lost hope. She says that beating India and winning a gold medal in the SAG has become her one and only goal.
“We have to do this–for us and for the coming generation of female footballers. If we beat them once, we will no longer fear them,” she says.
Supporting her in this goal is her family who has always been by her side. That is why Limbu has enjoyed playing football as much as she has.
“My parents are proud of me. And I feel fortunate that I’ve been able to make them proud,” she says.
She also was quite happy with ANFA’s recent decision to remunerate both female and male football players equally. This, she says, has given them added motivation.
“All of us want to work harder than we did before because we want to prove that we are no less than the men,” she says. “If we bring home one trophy, it will be an inspiration to girls all around Nepal.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/saru-limbu-began-playing-football-barefoot-today-she-has-a-bigger-dream-for-her-nation.html,sports

"Dhurmus, Suntali’s cricket stadium project in limbo as donors don’t keep promises","Monday, February 1, 2021","The otherwise joyful face of Sita Ram Kattel ‘Dhurmus’ is without a smile lately. He is stressed not because he is not getting any roles in films or TV shows, but because his dream project, the Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium, has hit a brick wall.
Due to the lack of funds, the project has not moved as swiftly as he had hoped. His days are often spent thinking about how and where to manage the funds as, without it, the project’s future is in limbo.
“As soon as I wake up, I get calls from the suppliers asking me when they will get paid,” says the country’s noted comedian-turned-social worker. “I know it is hard for them too as they have trusted me and worked on this project, but right now, there is no cash to pay them.”
According to Kattel, the project owes nearly Rs 30 million to a single contractor. The project in total owes contractors over Rs 93 million, says Mukti Timilsina, the accountant at the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation. That has resulted in the foundation not being able to pay the workers involved in the construction of the project.
During the festive period, the foundation took a loan from a cooperative to pay the workers, says Kattel. He says it had borrowed nearly Rs 10 million to pay the workers. But since then, it has cut down workers from 313 to 161 as he says it is not possible to pay all of them.
Kattel had hoped that the funding the project would not be hard as a lot of people had said they would help. However, due to Covid-19, the expected funds did not come through.
Last year around January, the project was getting around Rs 700,000 through donations on a daily basis. The number of people visiting the site was quite good too. But, things have changed.
“People used to reserve buses to visit the stadium and look at the progress and help us financially. But, in recent times, we’ve not seen any people,” says Kattel.
According to the foundation, it has spent nearly Rs 400 million on the project to date. However, it says it has only received a little over Rs 300 million in donation and grants.
During a mahayagya (a religious function organised to fundraise) that took place in January 2020, around Rs 690 million was pledged by various donors. However, out of the Rs 690 million, only Rs 88 million has come through. Kattel says that had the remaining amount come through as expected, they would be able to finish the project on time.
“People think that we’ve already received the pledged amount from the mayayagya, but until now, if we convert the goods which we received as donations, we’ve only received Rs 100 million,” says Kattel.
The people who pledged the amount during the mahayagya have gone missing, says the foundation. These people range from parliamentarians to contractors to government officials, claims the foundation.
According to the foundation, Bagmati Province had pledged Rs 300 million, Bharatpur Metropolitan City had pledged Rs 127 million, Chitwan’s District Coordination Committee had pledged Rs 22.22 million, Gaidakot Municipality and LP Gas had pledged Rs 10 million among others.
Members from the foundation and the mahayagya committee members are trying to collect the pledged amount, but not much progress has been made.
“When we call people, many seem to have forgotten that they had pledged a certain amount,” says Timilsina.
The total cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 3 billion.
The stadium is taking shape, however. The work on the playing area is almost complete. The work on the stands are in place, but due to the lack of funds, not much has been done apart from laying the foundation.
Kattel says that a lot of time and money has been spent on making of the stand.
Match to raise money
In a bid to generate funds for the stadium, a cricket match is being held on February 6 at the stadium itself. Movie stars, singers, cricketers and 40 others from the entertainment industry will take part in the match.

4 most interesting and challenging golf holes in Nepal,"Monday, January 25, 2021","You may be surprised to learn that golf in Nepal is not just a Sunday afternoon game. Since 1993, when the Surya Nepal Masters Open began and the world saw how beautiful Nepal is, it has been an attraction for both professional and amateur golfers from all over the world.
Whether you are travelling for business or travelling purely for the pleasure of golfing here, Nepal’s golf courses are a sight to behold. Like any country, it has its regular courses, and then it has its beauts.
Let’s rediscover Nepal’s golf courses as gems for golfers who want to visit this beautiful country to swing their clubs.
If you ask any person what comes to mind when you say “Nepal”, if they are not saying “temples”, chances are they are talking about the Himalayas. It goes without saying, then, that the Himalayan Golf Course should be first up.
This course is truly a unique one. The entire course was built by hand, using sledgehammers to break rocks and carve this course out of the countryside. It took five years to finish.
Regularly named one of the most unique courses in the world, the fairways and greens are nestled in a ravine, with the clubhouse, opening and closing holes at the top, 250 feet up.
The golf itself is suitable for amateurs and pros alike, but that is not what you will take home with you. Your memories will be of the steep ravine walls, eagles flying overhead, and the sound of waterfalls gushing into the Himalayan river below.
If you thought the scenery of the first course was magnificent, wait for this one. Designed in 1999, it was Nepal’s first full 18-hole golf course, and hosts the Surya Nepal Masters Open.
You will be backed by spectacular snow-covered mountains as you meander through part of the Gokarna forest, which is ancient and the sheer size of the trees you will pass is evidence of that. Your first through holes will lead you through the trees, which can be challenging for amateurs.
You will emerge from the forest into the flats, and the biggest challenge—the 225-yard, par-3 8th hole—will be waiting.
You may be lucky enough to catch a sighting of a monkey in the forest, common deer, or a rare Indian Flying Fox gliding from tree to tree.
This nine-hole course is located at the Fulbari Resort. It is a private course, but if you are there in the off-season, you are likely to be able to play one round.
The course is situated on the top of a hill, overlooking the beautiful but intimidating Seti River gorge. We have yet to hear reports of a real yeti being found, but keep an eye out anyway!
This course used to be called the Gauchar Golf Club and began back in 1917 with an astounding 36 holes. It began as a golf course for royalty, namely King Tribhuvan Shah and his sons.
Over the years, as the nearby airport expanded, the golf course became smaller and smaller. It was renamed in 1965, and finally finished remodelling in 1989.
The nine-hole course is challenging and hosts almost 30 annual tournaments. It is lined with trees and has a stream running through it.
If you are not checking prices for plane tickets to Nepal, you should be! The golf is superb, but that is not the only amazing thing about this country.
If you are lucky enough to be around for a few days, immerse yourself in the culture and learn as much as you can. Get a taste of local cuisine, view some of the scenery from somewhere other than the course, and revisit your own spirituality.
Do not underestimate this stunning country. Even if all you do while you are here is hit golf balls, you cannot miss the beauty and atmosphere.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/most-interesting-and-challenging-golf-holes-in-nepal.html,sports

"Rashila Tamang: A teen’s race, from fun to fame, in Nepal’s trail and ultrarunning scene","Wednesday, January 20, 2021","Rashila Tamang first ran for fun. As a part of the Women’s Day event in 2015, a 16-year-old Tamang stood in the starting line wearing jeans and a shirt. She did not even have proper running shoes and had to borrow one from one of the hosts of the event. Running with shoes larger than her feet and clothes not meant for running, Tamang came second, only behind Mira Rai.
“I thought it was a rally,” says Tamang. “But, everyone started to run. It was only 5 km, but it felt nice to run and come second.”
A lot has happened in Rashila Tamang’s life since then. While she felt trail running was just going to be a fun thing to do, she never thought she would ever take it seriously. But, six years down the line, she has become a known figure in the field of trail and ultra-running in Nepal. She has taken part in and won or finished on the podium at events like the Everest Marathon, Mustang Trail Race, Annapurna 100, Panch Pokhari Trail Race, and Jiaozi Mountain Crossing in China.
“This is something that I had never imagined,” says the 21-year-old. “I really enjoy this and I will never stop running,” says Rashila Tamang.
A resident of Dhunibesi (Dhading), a village 21 kilometre west of Kathmandu, Tamang’s training to become a trail runner started at a young age. As her mother was diagnosed with asthma, and her sisters married, Tamang, from an early age, had to do a lot of heavy lifting going up and down hills from her house to the market. But, she really started to believe in her running ability after finishing the 10th grade in school and stood first at a 12-km running event at the Himalayan Outdoor Festival.
“That is when I felt I could do this and started to train in the village.”
Running around the village, Rashila Tamang would often be ridiculed by the villagers who would call her names and mock her. But, she says she never let that get to her head and continued to run. As part of her training, she even ran 21 km to college in Kalanki on a daily basis. Some days, she ran back 21 km too.
“The college had given me the freedom to wear tracks. I ran to and from college for a year. I feel this really helped me.”
Rashila Tamang’s career really took a turn for the better when she started to take part in Ktm Trail Race, a trail running event that took place in and around the valley every month. She took part in four races finishing on the podium in each of them. Closely observing her and her progress as a trail runner were promoters of the sport in Nepal.
“Rashila showed consistent enthusiasm and determination for trail running,” says Richard Bull, the race director of Trail Running Nepal. “So many people start something and give up because results don’t come fast enough. It never seems like she would do that. Her hard work is second to none.”
Ashish Mishra, a trail explorer who manages Rashila Tamang and her races, says Tamang’s can-do attitude and determination were something that makes her stand out.
“When she says she’ll do something, she does it: a reason why she has taken part in as many races in such a young age,” says Mishra. “This is not luck. She has worked hard to get where she is.”
Bull, impressed, then paved the way for her to take part in various other races. She took part in Mustang Trail Race, Manalsu Stage Race, and the Annapurna 100. Impressing in all the races, Rashila Tamang then became part of the Mira Rai Initiative which took her to Hong Kong to train.
“The training we got there was amazing. They taught us a lot. We were there for a year and even got to run a team race where we came second,” says Rashila Tamang.
That was 2018. After the training, she came back to Nepal and kept on running. She took part in all the major trail running events winning a few of them. But, her best year she says was 2019 when she won three major races: the Everest Marathon, the Mustang Trail Race, and the Jiaozi Mountain Crossing (in China).
“Hong Kong was great. Learned about shoes and clothes and all these small details that helped a lot improve timings and improve me as a runner.”
“Winning in China was a special moment. It was a tough race. The Chinese runner was very good. But, beating her in her own country was an absolute pleasure.”
In 2020, she had hopes of beating her timings she had set in 2019. She wanted to qualify for the UMTB and compete with international runners. But, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, her plans had to be put on hold.
“I did take a course to become a trekking guide along with a rock climbing guide. Add to that, I’ve also taken a basic course on the rescue.”
Rashila Tamang hopes that 2021 will be better. She wants to run more and qualify for events that she has always dreamt of running. She also feels that the trail running scenario in Nepal can get better and hopes that 2021 can be the year when the nation appreciates the sport and hope she and other who are in the sport can make people proud.

"New cricket coach Dav Whatmore in Nepal, likely to take charge next week","Monday, January 18, 2021","Kathmandu, January 18
Newly appointed coach of Nepal’s cricket team, Dav Whatmore, has arrived in Nepal. A source close to Whatmore said that he arrived late on Sunday evening and has now quarantined himself for five more days.
The source says that Whatmore is yet to meet officials of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN). He is expected to be unveiled as the coach at the end of this week or at the beginning of next week.
Whatmore was appointed head coach on December 17 by CAN. He replaces Umesh Patwal, who left the post vacant in February after a disappointing stint where he failed to lead the team to the T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in Australia in 2021.
Whatmore, a native of Australia, has the experience of coaching test-playing teams like Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. He famously won the 1996 World Cup as coach of Sri Lanka. Recently, he coached the Singapore national team.
His first assignment is likely to be tri-series against Oman and USA in Oman due to be held in March 2021.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dav-whatmore-arrives-in-nepal-likely-to-take-charge-next-week.html,sports

Former goalkeeper of Nepal’s national football team, Lok Bahadur Shahi, has passed away on Sunday. He was 65.
The All Nepal Football Association President Karma Chhiring Sherpa says Shahi breathed his last at his own house in Dailekh of Karnali on Sunday evening. He was suffering from various diseases.
It has been learned that his last rites would be performed in the home district.
Shahi, a member of the national team from 1982 to 1989, is considered one of the best goalkeepers the national team has ever got. Later, he also got elected as the general secretary of the national football-governing body, ANFA.

Johan Kalin as a coach couldn’t give Nepal football wins but says he had a vision for the field,"Monday, January 11, 2021","When Johan Kalin was appointed the coach of Nepal’s national football team in January 2019, there was a sense of excitement among Nepali football fans as he aimed to win a SAFF Championship during his tenure.
Having finished second with an average Machhindra Club in 2013, there was a feeling that by hiring him, Nepali football would go places. That feeling got stronger when Kalin led Nepal to a goalless draw against a strong Kuwait team in March 2019. However, with a record of just one win in 10 games, Kalin in November 2020, resigned from his position citing personal reasons.
While some fans were happy that he resigned, a lot were gutted. Many argued that his game was archaic, defensive, boring and his record spoke for itself. But, others say that given the team he had, he did well. They say he tried to make Nepal tough to beat, solidified the defence and paid a lot of attention on the players’ fitness. Both sides have strong arguments about Kalin, but he believes he did what was right for Nepali football but did not have sufficient time to realise his vision.
“My plan was simple: Make us strong defensively because we were conceding silly goals,” says Kalin after two months of resignation from his home in Sweden. “The goals that we conceded against Pakistan and the Maldives in the SAFF Championship are examples of these goals which if avoided could have turned the match in our favour.”
Kalin says that when he first took charge of Nepal, he knew that the major challenge would be sorting our leaky defence and make sure the players were paying attention to their fitness and were organised. In a bid to change the players’ attitude towards defending, he did many defensive drills mainly to change the players’ mindset.
“If you look back at all the goals that we have conceded in the past decade, almost all of them have been due to concentration lapses by players. My main challenge was to change that and make them understand tactic and where I was coming from,” he says.
With the aim of winning the SAFF Championship, he wanted to spend a year working on defence. The first few games saw a glimpse of that. In the two games against Kuwait, Nepal’s defensive performance was so good that even the Kuwaiti coaching staff praised it, he says.
“We were solid defensively. We had only worked for a few months and we were able to compete with the Kuwait team, who even though had just returned from a ban, were still very strong,” he says.
But, that joy was short-lived. Nepal lost 2-0 to Malaysia in June 2019 followed by what Kalin says is his worst game as Nepal’s manager in the 7-0 loss to Kuwait in September 2019 during the World Cup Qualifier.
“That was bad. I don’t know what happened,” he says.
That did not stop him from continuing to push his philosophy. He got rewarded too. A resilient performance against Chinese Taipei in Taiwan gave Kalin his first win as Nepal’s coach and Nepal’s first win in the group stage. That was followed by a game against Australia in Canberra which was a no contest. From the start, Australia bullied Nepal and ended up 5-0 winners.
“The scoreline didn’t paint a very good picture, but our boys did well, I think. We played well against players who play in top European leagues. At least for 70 mins, we did,” he says.
He says that had Nepal played attacking football against such a team, the scoreline could have been anything and questions the understanding of people who make such comments.
“In Nepal, people say I’m defensive, but it would have been a horrible decision if I had played open football against such a quality side,” he says adding that it is easy to criticise.
The loss against Australia was followed by a 3-0 loss against Jordan and 1-0 loss against Kuwait at a neutral venue in Thimpu. The latter, which was his last game in charge, was his best game, he says.
“We were awesome in that game. We gave them nothing but had a few chances ourselves. Sure, we conceded and lost but the performance was just amazing. I was so proud of the boys,” he says.
After that, preparations were underway for the rest of the games against Australia, Jordan and Chinese Taipei. But, Covid-19 started spreading across the world and Kalin moved back to Sweden to be with his parents.
“Times were tough. I wanted to continue, but my parents are old and I want to be here with them during these tough times. I didn’t think it would be fair on ANFA, the players and the fans, which is why I decided to resign,” he says.
His biggest regret he says is not to have managed a game in Nepal. Having sat with Nepali fans in the 2011 SAFF championship in New Delhi, Kalin was always fond of them. But, due to issues with Dashrath Stadium, all games were played away, even the home tie against Kuwait was played in Thimpu.
“I really wanted to have the fans backing. They have been supportive and would have given us a lift. Hopefully, they will get to watch Nepal steal some points in the remaining games.”
When asked what he feels needs to be done to improve Nepali football, he says attention needs to be given at the grassroots level and players must spend time at the training. He emphasised the need for more football pitches or plastic pitches so that more and more players could train. He says that the kids should be given good footballing education from an early age in a similar manner Germany did in 2006.
“We need to train and coach them well. Give them good coaches from a young age. That’s how football can develop,” he says. “Players are passionate, but we need to be realist too and work hard to work on our flaws.”
He says that even though his time came to an end early, he appreciated the support from the Nepali fans. That said, he does want them to be patient with Nepal as it will take time to become a better team.
“I know fans don’t like to hear the word ‘patience’. However, that is what it is. We need to be realistic. The next qualifying games are not going to be easy. But, for now, we need to look at performances rather than the results.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/johan-kalin-as-a-coach-couldnt-give-nepal-football-wins-but-says-he-had-a-vision-for-the-field.html,sports

Raju Adhikari: From picking up litter to picking up medals,"Wednesday, December 9, 2020","It was not long ago that Raju Adhikari spent his days on the streets of Hetaunda, picking up litter, inhaling dendrite and getting into spats. Having fled home at an early age, his life revolved around the streets, which he called his home. He had no idea what he was getting himself into. He did not know how old he was. He had no aim and nothing to look forward to.
Fast forward to now and Adhikari’s life has turned the corner. The kid who spent his early childhood doing cheap drugs has become an inspiration to kids like him. Having left that life behind, Adhikari was the captain of Nepal’s hockey team that won the Indo-Nepal Championship by beating India 4-3 in the final last year.
“I have come a long way if you look at it that way,” says Adhikari.
But, his journey from a street kid to representing Nepal has not been a straightforward one.
Adhikari took to the streets from an early age. As a child, he saw his father abuse his mother under the influence. Unwilling to see that, he used to spend time on the streets of Hetaunda with kids his age.  Soon, his mother left him, his father and his brother and fled. He did not want to live with an abusing father, hence fled and started living on the streets.
“I don’t remember much about that time. All I recall is missing my little brother,” says Adhikari.
As he did not have a roof over his head, he would often move between cities. Sometimes he would be in Hetaunda while on another day, he could be seen in Chitwan.
He was not alone. He was joined by his gang – fellow street kids his age.
“We would also go to Pokhara and Kathmandu too. We had friends in many places,” says Adhikari.
For food, he worked as a labourer. He spent a part of his days picking up sacks and delivering them to a designated place. During the night, he used to go through litter near the riverside to see if he could find anything useful or sellable. Going through the rags, he would often be chuffed when he found clothes.
“If we found metal, bottles and electronic items, we would sell them. If we were lucky, we would find food also,” he says.
The money that he got from selling the waste was seldom spent on food. Most of the time, the money was used to buy cigarettes, marijuana and dendrite.
“A bottle of dendrite would last us an entire day,” he says. “After consuming that, we wouldn’t feel the cold, nor would we be hungry. That and marijuana became a part of our lives.”
When he needed to sleep, he would crawl into a sack as if it were a sleeping bag and sleep on the pavement surrounded by fellow kids and street dogs.
He was on the street when he found out that his father had died. But, he was in no hurry to go see him or was he interested to perform the final rites. All he wanted to know was the whereabouts of his brother. Lost in his own world, he soon forgot about it.
In less than four years, Adhikari was a leader of his own gang. That meant he no longer had to carry waste. He had people doing that for him. There were days, he says, he would sit inhaling dendrite all day doing nothing.
“When we didn’t have dendrite or the money to buy it, we used to fight with other groups,” he says. “If we won, we used to take theirs.”
But, he says life was not easy in the streets. They would often be accused of stealing. Police would arrest them, make them do community service, and then release back on the streets.
“People would treat dogs better than they treated us. They looked at us with disgust,” he says. “Some would pelt stones at us while sleeping while some used to splash water.”
Soon, his life started to change when he met Arpan Parajuli, who was studying street kids for his dissertation.
“I saw him and his friends licking empty momo plates at a bus stop,” says Parajuli.
Watching that hurt Parajuli who then bought them a plate of momo. That made him close to the kids who then started to refer to him as mama (uncle).
He spent a lot of time with the kids. Every day he bought them a plate of momo. He even bought them clothes. Sometimes, he would spend the night with them on the streets.
“They were always inhaling dendrite. Their body had a lot of lice. They were very dirty,” says  Parajulu.
He wanted to help Adhikari and others. Disregarding his study, he rented a house and took Adhikari and 13 other street kids there.
“They agreed to live there. That is when I decided to form Mamaghar, a non-profit organisation,” he says.
When they first heard that they were being given a home, they were shocked. They were sceptical and did not want to go.
“We decided that we go there, eat food, and then go out,” says Adhikari, adding they felt very odd to have a roof over their head.
They used to make excuses and leave the house during the day and return in the night. They were still addicted to dendrite and cigarettes.  Parajuli had to face a lot of criticism and wrath from society for taking them in.  But, he did not lose hope and continuously tried to show them the way.
He enrolled them in a school. But, none of them was interested. Adhikari says the reason he did not want to be in school was that other kids used to make fun of him.
“They used to call us khate (Nepali word for street kids),” he says. “Plus, we weren’t used to going to school.”
But, slowly Parajuli’s effort started to show fruit. Adhikari and the boys gradually stopped inhaling dendrite and started to take life seriously.
To ensure they were fit both mentally and physically, Parajuli used to make the kids run in the morning. One day, a foreigner saw that and was curious about what they were doing. Wanted to learn more, he approached Parajuli and went to Mamaghar. There, he found out about Parajuli’s cause. He had nothing to offer Parajuli but good luck. However, he left his hockey stick and ball for the kids to play with.
“The kids had no idea what hockey was,” says Parajuli. “They used to spend their days hitting the ball with the stick.”
Watching the kids one day was Hetaunda’s hockey coach Manoj Sharma. He was shocked to see the kids playing with such a nice stick and asked them to join him for training.
Adhikari was happy when he was asked to play. He loved sports and loved being a part of the team.
“I wanted to be part of a team since I was a kid. I didn’t like to study. I wanted to play. When I got the chance to learn from the coach, I took that opportunity and started training every day,” says Adhikari.
The teenager, who felt suffocated in the walls of Mamaghar, found a new escape – hockey. He trained all day with his new friends. He had finally found a purpose in life.
Getting into sports also changed Adhikari and others way of life, says Parajuli. “They became more disciplined.”
With hard work, Adhikari started to find success. Soon he found himself playing for Bagmati province’s hockey team. He even played a provincial level tournament in Jhapa. Impressing there, he went on to take part in the seventh and eighth national games.
All that hard work paved his way into the national team, in which he along with his teammates created history little over a year ago.
Nepal were playing India in the final of the Indo-Nepal Championship. The Indians were clear favourites, but Adhikari, who was the captain, did not let that faze him or his teammates.
“They were clearly better than us. Most of them were over 25 and had far more experience than we did,” he says. “They were taunting us even before the match began. We knew that this was our biggest challenge yet.”
Adhikari’s team had beaten two Indian and one Nepali teams to reach the final. Their confidence was at an all time high. But, they also knew the challenge ahead.
Having encouraged his team all night, Adhikari scored the first goal of the match. When he did, the crowd erupted.
“It was like we’d already won,” he says.
But, he quickly realised that the game had just begun. India came roaring back in the game with three goals. That did not worry him or his team who came back from two goals down to score three and win the game.
“It is my proudest moment. The photo that’s making the rounds on social media is from that day,” he says.
With that, he shot to fame. People who called him a khate started to invite him for meals.
“People encourage me now to keep doing what I’m doing. A little bit of hard work can go a long way, can’t it,” says Adhikari.
He now even thinks about starting a family.
“I’m learning a few things to earn a living. Maybe after I start earning, I will think of a family,” he says.
He is learning new things because he knows that hockey will not give him the financial freedom he needs.
He says he has come a long way since his dendrite inhaling days. He often goes to the footpath where he wasted his time to reflect on how far he has come.

Nepal’s national men’s football team are playing their first match in the past seven months in Dhaka on Friday.
Currently, the team are in the Bangladeshi capital to play two friendlies with the host.
The first match will begin at the Bangabandhu National Stadium at 4:45 pm Nepal standard time today.

Many new players have made their place in the Nepali team this time due to the coronavirus infection and other injuries in senior players.
Nepal and Bangladesh have played 19 matches so far, among which Bangladesh won 12 and Nepal 6. One match ended in a draw. In the most recent match, Nepal defeated Bangladesh 2-0 in 2018.

"Amid pandemic, India organised IPL. What will be the fate of major cricket leagues in Nepal?","Friday, November 6, 2020","With the Indian Premier League 2020, the cricket world that had come to a halt because of the Covid-19 pandemic has revived. The resumption of this league gave the message that playing cricket would be possible even amid the pandemic if strict preventive measures are followed. Also, it raised questions regarding the fate of cricket leagues in Nepal.
There are three major cricket leagues in Nepal: Dhangadi Premier League (DPL), Everest Premier League (EPL), and Pokhara Premier League (PPL). All three are in limbo currently despite hundreds of thousands of rupees invested in them.
The DPL got postponed indefinitely. The EPL too was also deferred right before it was scheduled to start. The craze about West Indies batsman Chris Gayle coming to Nepal died with this decision, again due to the pandemic.
The PPL scheduled for October-November also has not shown any sign of starting anytime soon. Depending on the situation today, the organisers have been saying they cannot organise the league.
Because of the indefinite postponement of the events, all stakeholders from players to advertisers, and organisers all have been hit hard, says Dhangadhi Cricket Academy Chair Subas Shahi.
But, the Covid-19-hit organisers of the premier leagues have claimed that if the government gives permission to resume, they will find alternatives to organise the leagues here. The start of the IPL also gave a ray of hope for Nepali premier leagues.
Some experts are also suggesting organising the matches by adopting all safety precautions. They are of the view that the government’s directive to stop all sports activities citing the pandemic is unfair to the whole fraternity. They are also urging the Cricket Association of Nepal to schedule all such events in its calendar and create the favourable environment to organise them.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/amid-pandemic-india-organised-ipl-what-will-be-the-fate-of-major-cricket-leagues-in-nepal.html,sports

Pokhara cricket stadium unlikely to get complete anytime soon despite big investment and ambitious plan,"Wednesday, November 4, 2020","To equip the under-construction Pokhara Stadium with everything it needs and beautify it to the fullest, the Gandaki provincial government poured Rs 10 million whereas the federal government also invested Rs 20 million. But even with Rs 30 million at stake, the lack of coordination between the two levels of governments has ultimately left the budget unspent.
Although concerned agencies of both governments seem to have prioritised the project, it is unlikely to materialise anytime soon.
From the first year of its tenure (2017), the provincial government had its goal set to establish an international-level stadium in Pokhara. However, the province did not have an acre of land under its name.
In the fiscal year 2018/9, the provincial government allocated Rs 10 million for field research to establish the university. In the fiscal year 2019/20, another Rs five million was allocated for the same. However, not a penny was spent, and the budget allocation lapsed.
Meanwhile, a team was formed under Nepal Olympic Committee Vice-President Tej Bahadur Gurung to identify a suitable space for the proposed international cricket stadium. The team had recommended a 1,147-acre (147 ropanis) of land near Pashupati Ghat of Bharat Pokhari in Pokhara-33 as land appropriate for the stadium.
After that, the provincial government started the process to get approval to build the stadium. Upon its proposal, the federal government on January 24 this year decided to give the said land to the Gandaki province for further procedures.
A detailed project report (DPR) has already been prepared by the BRS Engineering Solution Pvt. Ltd. and it has sketched a fully-equipped stadium with the approximate budget plan of Rs 1.63 billion.
According to the DPR, the stadium will be built in 984 acres (123 ropanis) with seven pitches. It will have a capacity of 18,000 spectators, with 120 VVIP seats, 1,200 VIP seats and 100 seats for media personnel. Adjacent to that, it will have a building to accommodate 900 players. The stadium will have the capacity to accommodate parking for 400 four-wheelers and 600 two-wheelers with 70 VIP parking slots.
It is estimated that the stadium will hold T-20 series, one-day internationals and test matches in the next four years.
Gandaki Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung informs that the project has already begun and that the construction will be held in coordination with other levels of government.
The spokesperson for the provincial Ministry of Social Development, Tej Bahadur Kafle, also informs the project has been proposed to be enlisted as a multi-year project under the Provincial Policy and Planning Commission. He adds process for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the stadium has also started.
Meanwhile, the proposed land for the stadium lies near the Seti River bordering Pokhara-29 and Pokhara-33. Last year, the eastern side of the land was eroded by the river. Even if the flow of the river is to be diverted, it is assumed that another section of the land will be eroded. With erosion occurring every year in the area, will the Gandaki provincial government succeed to build a big-budget stadium? This question has not been answered yet.
The province’s Social Development Minister Nara Devi Pun, however, says, “We will begin the land conservation project first. In the current fiscal year, Rs 20 million has been allocated for the project. The budget will focus on the embankment of the land, in coordination with the Ministry of Physical Infrastructural Development.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/pokhara-cricket-stadium-unlikely-to-get-complete-anytime-soon-despite-big-investment-and-ambitious-plan.html,sports

Why did Delhi Capitals bench Nepal’s Sandeep Lamichhane in three consecutive matches?,"Thursday, October 1, 2020","The ongoing 13th Indian Premier League (IPL) has been the talk of the town in Nepal also. Eight teams are participating in the league, of which 11 out of 56 matches have already been played.
The IPL had been famous for being a melting pot of world-class cricketers playing together in different teams, stripping off their national jerseys for a change. Likewise, in Nepal, the IPL got even more popular after the star cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane was signed by the Delhi Daredevils [now Delhi Capitals (DC)] in 2018, becoming the first Nepali cricketer in IPL.
Lamichhane is once again listed among the Delhi Capitals players. However, in all three of DC’s matches played so far this time, he has not stepped into the field. He is considered an outstanding bowler in any league, but why was Sandeep Lamichhane benched for all three matches in this edition of IPL?
Here are three possible answers:
Each team in the IPL can sign up to eight international players. In a match, the team can have only four international players. To manage the combination, international players are listed in different playing sets.
For DC, South African fast-bowler duo Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, and Guyanese batsman Shimron Hetmyer have already made their appearances. In the meantime, Australian Alex Carey and Daniel Sams, along with Guyanese Keemo Paul and Lamichhane have been benched.
For the want of Indian players, batsmen and all-rounders, Delhi Capitals are compelled to use international players, exhausting the available quota. In addition, Stoinis and Nortje have performed outstandingly securing their position in future matches too.
Lamichhane is a leg-spinner. The DC have actively chosen to make Indian spinners play as they have three other Indian spin bowlers–Amit Mishra, Axar Patel, and Ravichandran Ashwin–with more experience than the Nepali start player. Patel is also a batsman, so his chances to be chosen grows.
Ashwin and Patel had played against Kings XI Punjab. In the game, Ashwin got injured and it seemed that Lamichhane would replace him. But, the DC chose Mishra as the replacement. For the second and third matches, the DC continued the same duo. If Lamichhane plays, the DC will have no option but to choose an Indian fast-bowlder instead of an international bowler.
The club have Rabada, a world-class fast bowler. Meanwhile, this season, Nortje got into the field from the very first match. The DC, of course, have Indian fast bowlers Ishant Sharma and Mohit Sharma, but Ishant got injured just before the league. Mohit played the first match for the DC while Avesh Khan played the second and Ishant played the third match.
The DC have been playing with three fast-bowlers and two spinners with other international bowlers–fast-bowler Sams or all-rounder Paul–as replacements. Two pace bowlers in one game hint that the DC have a weak hand in the quota and are unable to make a balance with the foreign players. But if the club decides to play with three spinners at once, Lamichhane can get a chance.
The DC have played all three matches with four international players in each. Out of the foreigners, Rabada and Stoinis have shown stellar performances whereas Nortje and Hetmyer have not fared well so far. Hetmyer has not been able to replicate his Caribbean Premier League performance and the DC have been in loss.
So far, it seems that Lamichhane will get to play if the DC decide to change the batting order or completely change the international players.
In both of Lamichhane’s previous IPL seasons too, he was on the bench in the earlier matches.
Delhi Capitals will play next against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday, October 3.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-did-delhi-capitals-bench-nepals-sandeep-lamichhane-in-three-consecutive-matches.html,sports
"History of volleyball, Nepal’s national sport, in 5 points","Wednesday, September 30, 2020","It has been three years since volleyball got the status of the national sport of Nepal. The decision seems logical, geographically, because volleyball is played in all 77 districts of Nepal. It is popular among locals in every nook and cranny. Yet, neither the sport nor its players have made any significant progress.
In about eight decades of volleyball history, Nepal has made its international presence for only about four-and-a-half decades. So far, Nepal has won just one gold, one silver and four bronze medals in volleyball, internationally. The history of the national men’s team is sadder than the women’s as it was the latter that bagged the gold and four bronze medals in their nearly three decades of international play.
Another sad part about the sport is that no one knows how and when volleyball started being played in Nepal, and how it reached rural Nepal.
What is known is that volleyball was brought into Nepal in 1933/4 from England, with Nepalis who were in the British Army being the conduits. In 1942, students of Tri-Chandra College first played volleyball at the community level. This was later mentioned in a book published after the first National Games in 1982.
Hence, the development of volleyball in Nepal seems to have started before the dawn of democracy. However, history shows concrete development in volleyball only seems to have occurred after the end of the Panchayat system in the 1990s.
Advocacy efforts to institutionalise volleyball began with the establishment of Nepal Volleyball Association in the late 1940s. However, there is not any evidence of any volleyball activities then. But, the aforementioned book does mention the National Sports Council (NSC)’s interest to promote the sport along with its efforts to include it in youth and sports competitions.
After 1945, volleyball was sporadically being played outside Kathmandu, in Biratnagar, Dharan, Pokhara, etc. Nonetheless, somehow, the competitions were being organised only among the police and the army. After the 1960s also, volleyball seems to have a history of being popular in the colleges. After 1969, the NSC is known to have distributed volleyballs, nets and other equipment to district development sports committees across the country.
In 1970, Tribhuvan University organised an inter-college volleyball competition. From 1971, volleyball training started being held in Nepal under the assistance of Japanese volunteers. It was being organised by NSC with coach Sunji Yanagiti.
In 1973, the National Sports Council organised the first-ever National Volleyball Competition in Kathmandu, in which 13 zones (Nepal was divided into 14 zones then) had participated with Bagmati and Gandaki finishing first and second respectively.
Common people’s interest could have increased after this. Considering the same, the National Volleyball Association was established under Anoop Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana’s presidency in 1974. In the second National competition, all 14 zones participated with Narayani as winners. The national competition got continuity and it picked up its pace in development and popularity.
Just after two years of that, in 1976, Nepal participated in an international competition. With captain Rishi Raj Acharya Pokharel and coach Prachanda Bahadur Singh, Nepal played eight games in Lahore and Peshawar of Pakistan but did not register any win.
Other team members consisted of Resham Gurung, Madhusudan Rana, Prakash Bahadur Singh, Rabin Shrestha, Pradip Bahadur Singh, Mohan Lal Shrestha. They were selected after the third National Volleyball competition
This event is remembered in history to date. “Nepal’s white dress used to get dirty every day. We had to wash the jersey every day and wear the next day,” remembers Kapil Kishore Shrestha. Shrestha, a key player then, later served as a coach also.
The international appearance, according to Shrestha, was the much-needed experience for the new players. “Other four teams were better and more experienced than us. Our average age in the team was below 20. We still had not learned all the techniques. It was there that we learned about floating service and attack combination.”
“Regardless of the failure to win, our team got love from the Pakistani audience, and our new experience of having a fan following, including some Nepali-speaking audience members looking for our autographs.”
Followed by the debut, Nepal made appearances in China and Russia the very next year. A team under Harihar Shrestha went to China. There, they played and practised under the captaincy of Resham Gurung. “Playing and gaining experience in China and Russia was a golden opportunity for us,” Shrestha says.
The event served as preparations for the Asian Games in 1978. Nepal were put in a group with Japan, Kuwait, the UAE, and Bangladesh. Nepal played and lost against each of them.
Dipak Sapkota, who played during the Asian Games in Japan, was named among the top 12 best players of Asia by a popular Japanese newspaper.
Only after four decades of the sport’s history, Nepal were finally able to register a win internationally with a bronze medal. Nepal played many games, from Asian Games to South Asian Games, but never could win the titles.
In 2017, Nepal men’s team participated and placed third in the Asian Central Zone Senior Men’s Volleyball Championship after defeating hosts in the Maldives.
While the fifth edition of the championship was being held on the men’s side, Asian Volleyball Confederation decided to hold the first Asian Senior Women Central Zone Volleyball Championship 2019, in Bangladesh.
Nepal’s women’s team swept all five games and clinched the gold medal, making an unforgettable history. It was even more impressive that Nepal did not lose any set in any of its matches and won the final with a score of 15-0.
The women’s team, rejoicing its win, also planned to win the 13th South Asian Games. Unfortunately, even with the immense support from the audience, the dream of winning the title on home grounds got unfulfilled and they had to lose close to the finals. They did secure the bronze, after beating Sri Lanka in the semi-finals.
Maybe, this is the most important question: what next for Nepal’s volleyball team? Unlike bodies governing football and cricket, the body governing volleyball even does not have its office. Nepal Volleyball Association was set to elect its new committee, but the elections have been uncertain due to the Covid-19 crisis.
The government’s budget for volleyball is also low with only Rs five million for a covered hall. There is no volleyball academy to produce new talents. No new players are being trained from the school level. Overall, the country’s national sport neither has a covered hall for practice nor the necessary preparations at the grassroots.
More than a dozen domestic sports events are held annually. The federation holds at least six competitions for men’s and women’s teams. Former volleyball player Harihar Shrestha says regular competitions as well the presence of the players and their games are very good. Former player Sapkota also expresses he is glad about the progress made in both men’s and women’s sectors. But, for the development of volleyball, the country still has to work on infrastructures and on producing players from the grassroots.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/history-of-volleyball-nepals-national-sport-in-5-points.html,sports
History of Nepali cricket: 5 cricketers you should know,"Thursday, September 17, 2020","The status of Nepali cricket today is all thanks to the few outstanding Nepali cricketers who created history with their performances and contributions. Nepal’s commercial cricket took a shape between 1988 and 1996; it involves many from affiliate members to associate members. People then had limited awareness of the sport, but its vivacity did not subside.
There are already remarkable achievements in this field even though its history is relatively short. One of the most shining moments is the national cricket team elevating and bringing home the trophy of ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament in 2006. They had become runners-up in the 2002 ACC Trophy.
Nepal rejoiced a huge success during the coaching of Roy Dias when they beat the USA and claimed the WCL Division Five 2010 title. After that, another coach Pubudu Dassanayake won the hearts of Nepali cricket supporters and uplifted Nepal from Division IV to Division II. The biggest of all was when they qualified for the ICC Tournament in the form of ICC World T20 2014. Then, in 2018, Nepal got the one-day international (ODI) status for the first time.
The world-renowned sport has garnered fans in Nepal too. The dedicated fan base of Nepali cricket team was possible due to the players who had ardour for cricket and set a cohesive history. The players like Paras Khadka, Sandeep Lammichhane, and Shakti Gauchan have become household names and many take them synonymous to cricket. However, there are many other talented cricket players who have contributed to establishing Nepali cricket to the status it is today.
Below are five such cricketers who have given outstanding performances and should be remembered by all cricket watchers.
Raju Khadka was one of the best cricketers in Nepal in the late 1990s. He entered the cricket world in 1996 in a match against Bangladesh. Khadka was one among the first batch of Nepali cricketers who stepped up to the international field. He had scored an unbeaten 105 off just 50 balls against Bhutan during the 2003 ACC Emerging Nations Tournament in March 2003.
Subsequent years proved remarkable for Khadka as he made a first-class debut playing in the 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup and then made his appearance in the 2004 ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur and ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament matches. He managed to remain a top-notch captain in the years 1998, 2000, and 2002.
Thakuri has made great contributions to the Nepali cricket fraternity though his career was short-lived. His performance in ICC Trophy and ACC Trophy is still cherished in the history of Nepali cricket. He always gave the audience a good show.
Sadly, he passed away due to illness and poor health at the age of 40. Till then, Nepal could witness him in 14 matches and cheered him up for his outstanding performances. He is still remembered as one of the good team players and a kind human being.
Dipendra Chaudhary started his career from the 1998 ACC Trophy, in which he played against the UAE and Hong Kong. Then, he stepped up to the Under-19 World Cup 2000 held in Sri Lanka in which Nepal came eighth. He gave his elite performance in the coming years as well, including 2001 ICC Trophy, 2002 ACC Trophy, and 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup.
Then, he enthusiastically performed in the 2005 ICC Trophy and positioned Nepal at the third place and in 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup.
Binod Das started his journey with the under-19 cricket. He contributed to bringing forward Nepal as the runners-up at the 1997 Youth Asia Cup held in Hong Kong and 1999 Youth Asia Cup in Singapore. Later, his back-to-back appearance stunned everyone in the 2000 ACC Trophy and 2000 ICC Under-17 Asia Cup. After great hard work, he finally nailed the 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup in which Nepal played the finals against the UAE.
He also gave his best performances in the following years, in particular, in 2004 ACC Trophy, 2005 ICC Trophy, 2005/06 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament, and 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup.
Apart from his ravishing performance in the field, Das is also recognised as an ACC Level III certified coach. As he has coached the CAN-XI team, students in National Cricket Academy, Nepal Premier League, and Nepal Cricket School. He also served the national team as an assistant coach.
In the women’s team, Rubina Chhetri came into limelight after she took over the captainship of Nepal’s national women’s cricket team in 2012. She is well known for being the first woman cricketer for Nepal to take three wickets a one go in a women’s twenty20 international match.
After watching her splendid performance, she also got a chance to debut internationally in Thailand Women’s T20 in 2019 against China. After that, she performed back-to-back, in 2019 ICC Women’s Qualifier Asia, 2019 ICC Women’s World Twenty20 Qualifier and 2020 Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournaments.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/history-of-nepali-cricket-5-cricketers-you-should-know.html,sports
Nepal’s national cricket team members finally get salaries for 2019,"Thursday, September 10, 2020","Kathmandu, September 10

Kathmandu, August 23
Cricket Association of Nepal says members of Nepal’s national cricket team are likely to see a pay rise of Rs 10,000 in their monthly salary.

7 Nepali cricketers everyone should know about,"Sunday, August 2, 2020","With some outstanding achievements by the Nepali cricketers in the past few years, cricket has been established as a renowned sport in Nepal. The players’ contributions, at both the national as well as international levels, have been remarkable enough to make history in the field of Nepali cricket so much so that the Government of Nepal has also started respecting and prioritising cricket.
Even among the group of talented players, some of the cricketers stand out from the rest, becoming almost synonymous with the term–Nepali cricket.
Below are some top Nepali cricketers promoting Nepal that everyone, cricket fans or not, should know about:
We start with the man, Paras Khadka, former captain of the national cricket team of Nepal. This all-rounder and fascinating cricketer is 6 ft 3 inches tall and is 33 years old. He is a right-hand batsman specialising in right-arm medium and right-arm off-spin bowling. After playing U-15, U-19, and the senior side, he made his first debut in a match against Malaysia in 2004.
He took over the captaincy of the team from 2009 to 2019, where he led and helped Nepal promote their status from Division-V to Division-III. It was under his captaincy that Nepal qualified for 2013 ICC World qualifier, in which Nepal came in the third position. This feat later helped Nepal to appear in the first-ever T-20 World Cup in 2014 as well. In 2019, he also became the first Nepali cricketer to hit his first ODI century. Captain or not, Khadka has always succeeded in uplifting the status of Nepali cricket.
This guy is one of the finest individuals making the country proud globally as an international cricketer from Nepal. Famous for his ‘leg-break bowling’ skills, Sandeep Lamichhane became the first-ever Nepali cricketer to play Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2018 for the Delhi Daredevils. He was one of the most sought after players of the season and his performance was remarkable, turning heads of the global cricket arena towards Nepal.
Prior to IPL 2018, he grabbed the headlines after Australian commentator and former cricketer Michael Clarke sponsored Lamichhane to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and offered to play for the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Sydney, Australia. His consistent outstanding performance keeps the cricket fans in awe everywhere, waiting for him to take a series of wickets. He only recently took a century of wickets in the Twenty20 internationals and will soon be appearing in Caribbean Premier League scheduled to start from August 18 in Trinidad and Tobago.
Another profound ‘right-handed’ batsmen from Nepal is Gyanendra Malla. He is the current captain of the national team of Nepal (The Rhinos or Gorkhalis), the successor of Paras Khadka from October 15, 2019. Earlier, he served as the vice-captain of the team for 10+ years, sharing outstanding partnerships with Khadka. He also substituted as the captain for the national team in July 2019 in the rain-affected match against Malaysia in the ICC World T-20 Qualifiers 2019 when Paras had an injury. The match was won by Nepal and Malla was declared as the man of the match for his smart captaincy and half-century in the match.
The first major uplift of his career came after he scored 145 runs in the U-19 World Cup of 2006. He was also one of the 11 players playing the one-day international (ODI) match against the Netherlands on August 1, 2018, which was also his ODI debut. Already an irreplaceable asset for the Nepali cricket, he continues to make various contributions to the history of Nepali cricket.

This Nepali cricketer with an earnest smile is an all-rounder. Shakti Gauchan is considered a legendary icon of Nepali cricket, with a remarkable impression on both the national and international levels. He specialises as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler and right-handed batsman. He became the first Nepali player to register an international hat-trick (wickets), in a match against Denmark in Dubai during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifiers.
He also scored 106 runs off 103 balls in the 2005 ICC World Cup Qualifiers, after which he became the second Nepali cricketer to hit the international century. In ICC World Cricket League Division IV 2012, he performed the most prominent, letting only 2 runs and taking 3 wickets with 8 maidens in the spell of 10 overs playing against Malaysia. He has also announced the ‘Man of the Match’ in the ICC World Cup T-20 Qualifiers 2014 for a 3-wicket haul and contributing Nepal to win the match against HK. Sadly, the player announced his retirement in 2018.
Born in the UAE, Sharad Vesawkar is the mainstay batsman of the national cricket team of Nepal. He was fond of cricket since childhood and his strong humbleness and determination led him to become an elegant cricket player in Nepal. His first-ever international match was the 2002 U-15 Asia Cup in the UAE. This was a very special and unforgettable match for him. This is because he saw a major upliftment in his career with this match played in the UAE.
He was one of the best batsmen of the event with a total of 275 runs in 8 matches with remarkable scores of 106 against Qatar and 78 against India. He is the third Nepali cricketer to score an international century with an unbeaten 105 off 134 balls in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five in a match against Fiji. Besides this, his national and international achievements are countless.
Dipendra Singh Airee (or Dipendra Airee) is a 20-year-old right-handed batsman and right-arm medium bowler. He made his List A debut for Nepal in the ICC World Cricket League Championship 2015/17 in a match against Kenya. He was also the captain of the national team in the Group A ACC U-19 Asia Cup 2017. In that match against India, he was declared the ‘Man of the Match’ scoring 88 runs and taking 4/39.
During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour on 6 November 2019, he made his first-class debut playing against the club. Then, he was made the vice-captain of the team for the ACC Emerging Team Asia Cup 2019. He made his first ODI debut playing the first-ever ODI match against the Netherlands in 2018 World Cup Qualifiers being one of the 11 players from Nepal.
Another inspiring cricketer is 24-year-old Sompal Kami. He is a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast bowler. He made his debut playing against the UAE in the 2014 ICC World Cup Qualifier. In a match against Afghanistan in the series, his bowling speed was measured over 140 km/hr. Talking about his batting, he also set an international record of being the highest-scoring batsman with 40 runs off 31 balls against Hong Kong in the 2014 series.
Kami outshined all in the ACC Premier League 2014, in which he became the first Nepali bowler to take a five-wicket haul in an ODI match for 47 in and against Malaysia. Also, he was declared the best bowler of the tournament after he took a total of 15 wickets. In 2015, he again proved himself and became the leading Nepali wicket-taker in the ICC World Cricket League Division II with 11 wickets in six matches. He took five wickets in the 2014 Asian Games and gave another outstanding five-wicket haul against UAE in the 2019 ODI.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/7-nepali-cricketers-everyone-should-know-about.html,sports

Coach blames lack of exposure for Nepali women cricketers’ SAG failure,"Sunday, December 8, 2019","Kathmandu, December 8
The coach of Nepal national women’s cricket team Jagat Tamata says his players could not win a gold or silver medal in the ongoing South Asian Games in spite of their hard work. He says the players could not excel because of the lack of exposure.
Though the team were looking forward to the gold medal, they ended the journey with the silver medal on Saturday. A day after that, Tamata views, “The players played well, but they lacked exposure.”
He explains in an interview with Onlinekhabar, “Our cricket association was suspended for the past three years and the suspension was lifted just recently.” Tamata, nevertheless, says the event was also an opportunity for the team to groom themselves.

How Manchester City’s owners became the titans of a global sports-entertainment complex,"Monday, December 2, 2019","
US private equity firm Silver Lake acquiring a stake in the City Football Group (CFG), owners of English Premier League football team Manchester City, is a stunning development. Based in California, the investor has taken a 10% share in CFG for £380 million, valuing the group at almost £4 billion. Headlines have inevitably hailed the deal as one that makes Manchester City the world’s most valuable football club.
There is no doubt that the east Manchester outfit is a much more valuable asset than it was just over a decade ago. When current owner Sheikh Mansour (a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family) bought Manchester City in 2008, he paid £210 million.
But valuing football clubs is not necessarily a precise science, as the proliferation of valuation rankings demonstrates. At the same time, CFG is not just Manchester City alone. It is a group of clubs and related commercial activities that has been built up across the world.
So to imply that City is the world’s most valuable club is slightly disingenuous. Nevertheless, the punt that Silver Lake has just taken on CFG reveals a great deal about the trajectory its business is on.
Nearly 20 years ago the group’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, was vice president and finance director of Spain’s FC Barcelona. During his spell there, Soriano spoke of his vision to build a football club in the image of the Walt Disney empire.
He foresaw the convergence of entertainment and sport in a globalising world. And he also highlighted the role that franchising could play in football, along with the contribution that merchandise could make to club revenues.
Fast forward several years and by 2012 Soriano was in charge at CFG. Released from the political constraints of working for Barcelona (where board members are elected by fans, known as “socios”) and instead underwritten by the petrodollars of Abu Dhabi, the Catalan business leader was given the resources and autonomy to transform the organisation.
Since then, CFG has established franchise clubs around the world, including the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, and Uruguay. Latest news also indicates that CFG are on the verge of acquiring a club in Mumbai, India. No surprise that the city has a sizeable community of football fans, but is also the spiritual home of Bollywood and a focal point for India’s tech sector.
In 2015, CFG’s financial and political fortunes were further boosted as a Chinese investor took a stake in the business. Tellingly, the deal was announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK, during which he met then prime minister David Cameron and all manner of football, business and political deals were agreed.
So it was no surprise when, earlier this year, CFG announced plans to establish a Chinese club franchise (in Chengdu). At the same time, Abu Dhabi announced that its state airline Etihad (Manchester City’s shirt and stadium sponsor) would be enhancing its links with Chengdu’s airport. At CFG, football is often the means to an end, not just an end in itself.
Many of these deals were overseen by Soriano who, in the midst of it all, was also closely monitoring and responding to technological changes. Notwithstanding his original Disney vision, the nature of the movie, broadcasting and sport industries has changed dramatically over the last decade – meaning that football and entertainment are no longer Mickey Mouse pursuits.
New digital platforms have emerged, streaming has taken hold and content generation has become the fuel adding impetus to a new industrial revolution. Indeed, CFG has already taken advantage of this through, for instance, the development of its Cityzens platform and the club’s involvement in the Amazon TV series All or Nothing.
The investment made by Silver Lake in CFG is a clear acknowledgement that football is a globally compelling product, a superb source of content, and a basis upon which shrewd business people can make a profit. More importantly, as if further evidence was needed, it marks the latest move in a convergence of sport, entertainment and digital technology.
With Ferran Soriano providing his foresight and strategy, and Sheikh Mansour providing the money and politics of a wealthy new state seeking its place in the world, Silver Lake is set to bring entrepreneurial zeal and a strong track record of successful tech investments. This should help CFG, and more specifically the various franchises within the group, to establish a competitive advantage over their football rivals.
As such, CFG is at the apex of what it means to be a 21st century football business – a mixture of money, entertainment, technology and politics. Clubs like Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig are following their own franchise path, while a growing number of teams across Europe have had fly-on-the-wall documentary series made about them. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid take their digital footprints very seriously, while French champions Paris Saint Germain has a Qatari owner.
It is currently only CFG that brings everything together in one place, however. And it is on this basis that Silver Lake has invested in what was once a football club with historic roots in the working class communities of east Manchester, but is now a global entertainment business catapulted to the top of the football’s valuation charts.

I still have a lot to offer for Nepali cricket: Paras Khadka,"Thursday, November 7, 2019","
Paras Khadka, who stepped down as captain of the national cricket team, is not playing the series against MCC. However, Khadka, who is preparing to go to Dubai to play the T-10 league, is ever-present at the TU Cricket Ground to cheer up his teammates.
On Wednesday, Onlinekhabar’s Raj Kumar Shrestha caught up with Khadka and spoke to him about why he didn’t play this series, his aspiration in the T-10 league and his future plans. Excerpts:
The team you’ve captained for a decade is playing right now but you’re not a part of it. How does it feel to watch the team from the stands?
When I resigned I had said that I wanted a break from international cricket. That is why I’m not playing. But as a player, it doesn’t feel great to not be playing. If you talk to any player, they will tell you that they want to be playing. When you play, the feeling is different from that when you are on the sidelines. But I’m enjoying watching our boys play in whites. It’s been a while since Nepal played three-day cricket, which in itself is good for us going forward.
Don’t you think the team needs you during this transition phase? Why aren’t you playing?
I’d asked the management to not put my name in the T-20 and three-day squad. However, I did want to play in the 50-over match. Sadly, due to health reasons, I could not play in that one.
So you’re disappointed not to play?
I wouldn’t say disappointed. It’s just part of a cricketer’s life, to be honest. You’ll obviously miss some games in your career. As I missed out, someone else has got a chance to play for Nepal so I wouldn’t stay I am disappointed.
After this, you’re going to Dubai to play the T-10 league. Is it a coincidence that you were selected to take part in the league after you resigned as captain?
Well, you have to call it a coincidence. I think I received an offer to play the T-10 league five days after I resigned as captain. When the approach was first made, I was quite unsure. I consulted with family, friends, and coaches who told me that it’s a great opportunity and that I should go play.
I had decided to take a break from cricket as a whole, but coaches told me that this was too big an opportunity to miss out on. It’s funny that I left one thing and got something back in return. But as I said, this is just a coincidence.
I’m looking forward to it as well. I want to play and prove to the team that I can do well in the competition. I will be representing Nepal in the league and if I do will it can open doors for other cricketers as well.
Personally, what is your view on T-10 league?
Well, this is new to me. As a player, you want to play in these global franchise leagues. I’ve got an opportunity and I feel lucky to have got it. It’s a different format and I’m excited. I hope I can justify my team buying me. But that said, I think I’ll play the way that I always play – giving 100 per cent. It’s a good opportunity and I hope more Nepali cricketers will get this opportunity.
Is this the beginning of Paras Khadka’s international franchise career?
As it’s the first time I’ll be playing international franchise cricket, you can call it the beginning.

Are you hopeful that this will open the door to popular T-20 leagues like IPL, BBL CPL?
That will depend on my performance. I know Nepali cricket fans want players like me to play in these league but it depends on my performances. If you do well, international cricket will recognise you. Which is why my aim is to play good cricket.
Some have been saying that these franchise leagues were not your priority when you were captain. Is that true?
I feel playing international T-20 leagues like IPL, CPL, and BBL is every cricketer’s dream. Me being captain does not affect that dream I think. But I will say that as a captain you have to think about a lot of things. I’ve tried my best to do what is good for Nepali cricket. Some decisions that I’ve made have been correct and similarly, I have also made some bad decisions.
What feel is right now I can just concentrate on playing cricket and playing well. I have nothing else to worry about and I guess that is going to be fun. Cricket is something that will stay with me for life. I will not be able to go away from it. The best thing for me is the ball hitting the middle of my bat. I want to play cricket. I have no other agenda right now. But I do feel a bit relieved as I am no longer the captain.
Had you wished to be part of the IPL or other leagues for that matter?
I’d say yes. But if you ask this to any cricketer they will say yes. I wouldn’t just say IPL. No cricketer would say no if you asked him to play in a franchise league. What I feel sad about is we have only been able to play one world cup. We have failed to qualify for the ODI World Cup and have missed out on 2/3 T-20 World Cups. Had we played in these tournaments, we would have had more exposure. I guess it would have opened the door for more competitions. That said, I do feel we can play in these tournaments in the future. I think we are more than capable. But for that, all of us need to come together.
Do you think your performances in Singapore was the reason for your selection in the T-10 league?
Maybe. Because in cricket they say one catch can change a match and one innings can change a career. Maybe that 100 in Singapore is that innings for me.
Are you talking to Pakistan Super League and other leagues as well?
I’ve sent my name for the PSL draft. But I don’t know if I’ll be selected. Let’s see what happens. People were asking me if I will play in the Emerging Nations or the T-10. I do feel the country should always come first, but I had already committed to play the T-10 league. I asked our coach Umesh Patwal if it was fine with me playing in the T-10 league and he told me to go. He told me that young players will be given a change instead of me which is why I decided to go to Dubai. But in the future, if the choice is between country and franchise team, I’ll always choose the country.
As you said, one inning can change a player’s career. Can we expect such an inning during the T-10 league?
I cannot guarantee anything like that. But that said, I will try. In this sport, as you play along you get to create records. For me what’s important is that the team wins.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/i-still-have-a-lot-to-offer-for-nepali-cricket-paras-khadka.html,sports
Kajal Shrestha: This lady who defied patriarchy to grow as a cricketer can help Nepal win prized SAG medal,"Monday, November 4, 2019","
Since making her national team debut in 2014, Kajal Shrestha has not looked back. As a young cricketer, she was belittled, discouraged and told to stay at home and help in house chores. But Shrestha, not listening to the naysayers, has established herself as an important member of the national women’s cricket team. She was declared the best batswoman in the recently concluded Women’s Champions League.
“For us girls, it’s not easy to get into cricket because it’s still considered the ‘men’s’ game. Especially here in Nepal, where everyone has an opinion of what you’re doing. But looking back, it’s safe to say that my journey which has been full of ups and downs has been absolutely worth it,” she says.
Unexpected break
Shrestha grew up in Kakarbhitta, Jhapa. She never really thought of becoming a cricketer. As a child she played whatever sport there was with her friends. Sometimes it was football; she says she tried playing basketball and volleyball but when she started playing cricket at the age of 14, she found her true love.
“It just felt right. Talking part in inter-school tournaments, then representing Purbanchal (the eastern games) in the national games. The more I played, the more fun I had and the more love and respect I started having for the game.”
Shrestha played a lot of age-level cricket. She played in domestic U-15 and U-17 tournaments, but her first break came during a U-19 tournament in Kakarbhitta.
At the tournaments were national selectors looking for the next batch of female cricketers. Shrestha along with other cricketers had no idea that they were there and when she won the best batswoman’s time during the tournament, she was selected to join the camp from ACC Premier League in Thailand.
“It was surreal. No one knew that it was a selection tournament. I had played a lot of cricket but was never selected, but that tournament put me on the map. My hard work paid off but I knew that I had a lot to do to stamp my authority in the national team.”

Defying patriarchal odds
Up until then, no one had given her a chance. She says her grandparents were against her as were a lot of other members in her family. However, she says she did have support from her mother who urged her to play.
“My parents were pretty okay with me playing cricket. But it was others who had a problem. Relatives and others in the neighbourhood used to tell my parents that they should not let me play cricket. Some came up to me and told me I should stay at home and wash dishes and clothes. There was a lot of negativity around. But when I won the title during the U-19 tournament and got selected for the national team, people’s doubt started to disappear. That is when people started appreciating me.”
Shrestha’s first tournament for Nepal didn’t go as planned. Opening the innings against Thailand, she quickly knew that at that level there was no margin for error. Playing a rash shot, she got out quickly and Nepal lost to the hosts. But since then, she says she has learnt a lot and tried to make sure she doesn’t lose her head when batting.
Since her debut, Shrestha has been a regular in the team. She says that she idolises Sarah Taylor, who also plays as an opening batter and a wicketkeeper for England. However, Shrestha still yearns for a big score.
“I know that: to keep myself in the team, I have to score runs. I’ve been playing some rash shots and getting out but I’m slowly finding my form.”
Preparing for SAG
In front of her now is the South Asian Games taking place in Nepal in December. She says the entire team are upbeat for the tournament where their aim is to win a medal. Shrestha adds that the WCL has boosted the confidence of a lot of her teammates, all of whom want to do well.
“We want to do something this year in the SAG. I know it’s going to be tough as we’ll be taking on better teams, but I think if we carry on at the way we are, there is a chance we can do well in the tournament.”
For that, Shrestha says the team have been working hard in training from mid-September. She also says that the training camp helped her during the WCL. She says that the number of practise matches that she’s played has helped her a lot and says that there should be more camps and tournaments for women’s cricket to evolve.
“The number of balls I faced during the camp has helped me a lot. We need more camps and more tournaments. This year, the WCL was great. We need to have these tournaments for us to feel good and also play well in future.
When asked if she’s satisfied with her career so far, she says she is.
“I don’t see myself doing anything apart from cricket. I like what I do but there are times you do question yourself if this was all worth it,” she says.
“There is no fame. There’s hardly any money. Whenever I want something I have to ask parents which does not feel right. So there are times I wish I was doing something else but I have enjoyed my career so far. Sometimes I also regret not going to college, but I’ve given a lot to cricket, which is why I hope one day it’ll all pay off.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kajal-shrestha-this-lady-who-defied-patriarchy-to-grow-as-cricketer-can-help-nepal-win-prized-sag-medal.html,sports

Khadka was the captain of the team for the past 10 years. In his leadership, Nepal obtained the one-day international status and played the T20 World Cup. He had debuted in the senior team in 2004.
In spite of stepping down, Khadka is likely to play as a member of the national cricket team for the next few months.
Surprising: Gyanendra Malla
Meanwhile, the team’s vice-captain Gyanendra Malla has commented that Khadka’s decision is surprising and unexpected. He says working as Khadka’s deputy was a good experience, adding the team still needs his leadership.

Prince Dahal: Nepal’s young shuttler aims to fly Nepali flag in Olympics,"Friday, September 20, 2019","
For 16-year-old Prince Dahal, the last year has been nothing short of remarkable. After impressing in almost all national-level tournaments, the young shuttler won the U-15 Dubai International Series title in October 2018. However, little under a year since his historic win, Dahal has gone on to better his achievement. Just a few days ago, he beat the ninth-seeded Indian Varun Kapur in the U-19 boys’ singles final of the same tournament this year.
“It’s been an amazing few days. I don’t think it’s really sunk in. This is for the entire country. To beat such a good player in the final is amazing. Hard work pays off after all,” shares Dahal.
Dahal started playing badminton from as early as five. He draws inspiration from his father who played badminton with his friends every day in their hometown, Kalanga, in Darchula. “My father is someone I look up to a lot and still do actually. He is why I am a badminton player. He is who taught techniques and is probably the best coach I’ve had,” adds Dahal who says he played in a lot of local tournaments in his home town of Kalanga.
By the time Dahal was nine he had shown his parents he had the talent, but his parents knew that he didn’t have a chance to make it big in Darchula which is why they brought him to Kathmandu.
“All I wanted back then, and even now, is to play this sport. A reason why I told my parents that I would only study in a school which has a badminton court,” adds Dahal, who in 2013 was admitted to Nepal Police School in Bhaktapur.
Dahal adds that he learnt a lot in school. He shares that the school had a better badminton facility and better coaches where he could refine his skills. Just a year after coming to Kathmandu, Dahal then took part in various age-level tournaments across the valley winning both the U-14 and U-16. However, he missed out on the U-19 title which he shares added fuel to his fire to become a great badminton player Nepal has ever seen.
“When you lose, you want to do better. You want to beat that person the next time you play. That tournament was alright for me but I wanted to more. Win more.”
Having won the first tournament he played in Kathmandu made Dahal’s confidence grew. That is why he started to compete in the open category at only 14.
“My father said I could excel in the open category and said that I was ready to play against the country’s best players,” he adds. His father’s prediction came true during the 2017 Krishna Mohan National Open Championships in which 14-year-old Dahal won a bronze medal beating one of Nepal’s best badminton players, Bishnu Katwal.
“Playing against such senior players has made me a better player. That tournament was a result of me and my father’s hard work. I still get goosebumps when I remember that tournament.”
Dahal says having played against such players has helped him in age level tournaments. But he knew that for him to get better, he had to train more which is why he took a two-year break from studies to focus on badminton.
“Out of the two years, I spent one year at the Banthongyord Badminton School in Thailand and the other I was here in Kathmandu preparing myself for Dubai International,” he shares adding that the decision to skip school wasn’t easy but it was one which had to be taken.
He adds it wouldn’t have been possible without his father who convinced his mother that it was the right things to do. “My mother didn’t want me to skip school. But my father understood. He knew that if I was to become a great badminton player I needed to sacrifice a few things. Looking back at the decision, to skip school wasn’t a bad one. Everyone is happy now,” he adds.

He shares his time in Thailand was very productive too. He adds that he learnt a lot of new things there which helped win this year’s tournament in Dubai. But Dahal isn’t someone who will be content with just one tournament. He is hungry for more and is now focusing on winning Nepal a medal at the South Asian Games.
“My aim is to win Nepal a medal at the South Asian Games. Not saying it has to be gold but aim to make people of Nepal proud during the tournament.” But he has high hopes for his future. He says his ultimate goal is to dominate the domestic badminton scene and even though feels it’s a long shot wants to represent Nepal in at least one Olympics.
However, Dahal knows it’s not going to be easy. He shares that Nepal doesn’t have proper equipment or facility. He adds the country doesn’t even have better coaches which is why he hasn’t joined any departmental team yet. “For now I am in a good place. I don’t have to join these teams. I play regularly and I personally feel I am getting better. What the future holds no one knows.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/prince-dahal-shuttler-aims-badminton.html,sports
"ICC, NSC agree to hold CAN election on September 27-28","Monday, September 16, 2019","
Kathmandu, September 16
The election and special meeting of general members of Cricket Association of Nepal has been delayed by a week after discussions between the International Cricket Council and the National Sports Council. The general assembly will now be held on September 27 and 28.
Previously, an independent committee formed by the international cricket governing body has scheduled the election for September 20 and 21. However, the meeting was put in limbo after NSC Member Secretary Ramesh Silwal called the independent committee member Rasjeshwor Shrestha, asking him to stop the AGM.
According to a source, Silwal had told Shrestha to stop the AGM citing a previous NSC decision stated that any sports committee should issue a notice 21 days before such election. Silwal had also stated that NSC should appoint an election committee to conduct the poll.
But, all problems have been resolved after ICC’s vice-president Imran Khawaja and NSC’s Silwal held talks with one another, the sources say.
The ICC has suspended the membership of CAN since 2016 citing political interferences. It is expected that the suspension will end after the AGM will elect a new committee. The ICC is organising a board meeting on October 13 which is expected to discuss the issue.

CAN election in limbo again after NSC’s ‘interference’,"Thursday, September 12, 2019","
Kathmandu, September 12
The National Sports Council has told an independent committee formed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to stop Cricket Association of Nepal’s annual general meeting and convention scheduled for September 20 and 21.
The convention was called in order to elect a new executive committee of the country’s cricket governing body and stakeholders have expected that it would end the ICC suspension on CAN imposed since 2016.
With the NSC directive, the future of CAN has been put in limbo again. Some have feared that the ICC would take even stronger action against Nepali cricket as similar political interferences had resulted in the suspension three years ago.
NSC Member Secretary Ramesh Silwal recently called the independent committee member Rasjeshwor Shrestha asking him to stop the AGM. According to a source, Silwal told Shrestha to stop the AGM stating that a previous NSC decision stated that any sports committee should issue a notice 21 days before such election. Silwal also stated that NSC should appoint an election committee to conduct the poll.
However, the ICC’s advisory committee had made a statute which states that the independent committee can call the meeting giving advance notice of seven days. This statute was endorsed by the NSC itself. The statute further states that the independent committee itself can form the election committee.
Following the statute’s endorsement, ICC’s independent committee has already held elections in all seven provinces. The independence committee members also claim the NSC cannot form the election committee.
Since CAN’s suspension, the ICC itself has been looking into Nepali cricket. The new statute was also drafted in consultation with the ICC.
The independent committee has reported NSC’s objection on the eve of the AGM.
Meanwhile, ICC’s Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja has said that he will personally speak with Silwal over the issue, according to an independent committee member. “The talk between Silwal and Khawaja should solve this problem. But you never know,” the member states.
The ICC is organising a board meeting on October 13 which is expected to discuss the CAN suspension. However, the agenda of the meeting is yet to be finalised.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/can-election-in-limbo-again-after-nscs-interference.html,sports

Bimal Gharti Magar: Nepal’s golden boy says he’s got a lot more to offer to Nepali football,"Wednesday, August 28, 2019","
In his short footballing career, Bimal Gharti Magar has been through a lot of highs and lows. From making his debut at the age of 15 to losing his sister, it hasn’t been an easy ride for Magar, who for the most part of his young career has had to live with the tag of Nepal’s golden boy.
Now 21, Magar says that he has put his past behind him, and he has a lot more to give and has set his hopes on winning at least one SAFF Championship.
Magar says he would never have become a footballer if not for his father who himself was a massive Basanta Thapa fan. He says his father always brought him football-related stuff urged him to play like Thapa. However, his father died in a bike accident before Magar got selected in the national team.
To fulfill his father’s dreams, Magar took part in U-12 trial in Butwal. However, he was not selected.
“I didn’t give up and I was eventually called up after one player withdrew himself from the team. That was quite fortunate after which I was enrolled in the ANFA academy in Butwal.”
After two years in the academy, Magar then made it to Nepal’s U-14 team and came to Kathmandu and was coached by Bal Gopal Maharjan. Magar shares that Maharjan played an important part in his career. He shares that Maharjan helped shaped him and adds that he owes a lot to the coach who made them work very hard.
“Most of the players that are in the current national team were coached by him at the age level. That kind of training is quite rare now. I feel lucky to have worked under him during age level as young kids now don’t get the same training we got while we were their age.”
After rising through the ranks, he made his national team debut at only 15, making him one of the youngest players to play for Nepal. Playing against Bangladesh before the 2013 SAFF Championships, he made his debut. He shares that his family was ecstatic when he made it to the national team. But he also agrees that he was under pressure due to which he could not perform at his best in his debut.
“I was under pressure as I did not know if I would be selected in the team for the SAFF Championship. But gladly I was and well the rest is history,” he laughs.
After sitting out on his first match, Magar got his chance against Pakistan; 1-0 down, and not knowing where a goal was coming from, Nepal’s coach threw Magar in the deep end. “That is a moment I will never forget. My first goal. The elation after the goal. The relief. It was amazing. I keep remembering it and I get goosebumps. In my first match, I was able to stop my team from losing. In an instant, I became a national hero. What else would a young boy who dreamt of scoring at Dasrath Rangashala want?” he adds.
But Nepal could not win the title. However, for Magar, his footballing career was up and running.
He also fondly remembers the 2015 U-19 SAFF Championships.
“That was quite a tournament, no? We were quite good. And beating India at home on penalties was just the icing on the cake. It was an amazing moment. The fans drove us forward and I won my first title that too as captain. I’ll never forget that day.”

Magar’s first senior title came in 2016 when Nepal’s team won the Bangabandhu Cup. This achievement was memorable for Magar; he feels that the team was quite weak then. Sagar Thapa along with others had been embroiled in the match-fixing scandal and the team was in turmoil.
“When we left for Bangladesh after a disappointing SAFF Championship in India, our main aim was to play good football. We didn’t have a competitive team and our coach back then Maharjan knew that. He wanted us to go there and express ourselves.”
With no expectation, the team started the tournament well finishing as group runners-up and reached the final by thrashing the Maldives in the semi-final and eventually winning the competition beating Baharain’s U-23 team in the final.
But since then, Magar’s career started to take a downward spiral.
In 2016, while Magar was in Belgium on trial with Anderlecht, he received news that broke him. He found out that his sister Manisha Gharti Magar was found dead at their home in Nawalparasi.
That broke him.

“Whenever I remember my sister, I go to another world. Such incidents change you as a person. It makes you think about life. She was there one day and she was gone the other. What was even harder was to control my mother. She was devastated. Having lost her husband relatively early in life, this was shattering for her especially.”
Watching his mother go through the incident is the hardest thing Magar says he has done. He says that he even considered leaving football, but after four months out of the game, he decided to make a comeback.
“I went to play in the Solidarity Cup. We won it. But I wasn’t as happy as others. My sister kept coming on my mind. After all, I was her big brother and I wasn’t there to protect her.”
Whenever Magar won any title, there used to be a homecoming party for him in his village. However, that year, he said he didn’t want one. “The incident has left a mark on me. Even though I have made a comeback in football, my game isn’t the same.”
Magar, who recently returned from the Maldives, is getting ready for the World Cup qualifiers. He is being put through his paces by recently appointed coach Johan Kalin. Magar believes that the qualifier is going to be a tough test for the team but he says that his aim, for now, is just to win the SAFF Championship.
“The World Cup is a long shot. For us to qualify for the World Cup a lot needs to change in the country. For now, all I want is to win the SAFF Championship and become Nepal’s leading scorer. Rest is just a bonus.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bimal-gharti-magar-nepals-golden-boy-says-hes-got-a-lot-more-to-offer-to-nepali-football.html,sports
Aim is to win the U-19 Asia Cup this time: Pawan Sarraf,"Thursday, August 22, 2019","
Pawan Sarraf, 19, is putting in the hard yards at TU cricket ground in Kirtipur. After an hour working on his batting, Sarraf, then takes off his pads, throws down his gloves, picks up the ball and starts working on his leg-spin.
Sarraf, like other members of the U-19 team, is getting ready for the forthcoming U-19 Asia Cup due to take place in Sri Lanka from September 5. There is an air of confidence in the tall all-rounder who says he has big dreams; one of them: winning the Asia Cup.
“This tournament is the start. There’s a lot more I want to do in life. I want to play in world cups, test matches and take Nepal cricket to new heights. Moreover, I want to become the best cricket player Nepal has ever seen,” he says.
But for now, the focus is on the Asia cup. Which is why after coming back to Nepal from a disappointing T20 world cup qualifier, where he didn’t play a single match, Sarraf went to his home town in Kalaiya. He says the atmosphere in his hometown is much better than Kathmandu.

“I can concentrate on my game and work on my weakness. The wicket there is better as compared to Kathmandu. More than that I have my brother there who keeps urging me to work hard and become a better player than I was in the previous tournament.”
Saraff, who did not play in the T20 qualifier, says he learnt a lot from sitting on the bench. He shares that spending time with coach Umesh Patwal has helped him a lot. He learnt about shot selection during pressure moments and how to react when things weren’t going his way. Even though he was disappointed about not making it on to the playing 11, he doesn’t feel hard done by. He adds that senior level is a lot different than age-level cricket because the pressure is quite high every time the nation is playing.
“You can make mistakes while playing at age level cricket, but once you’re with the national team the pressure is immense. You’re always playing for something or the other and that adds to the pressure.”
Sarraf, even though he has big hopes of winning the Asia Cup, knows that it isn’t going to be easy. Playing in the U-19 teams for the past few years, he’s realised the difference in class between Nepal and the rest of the test playing nations. He believes that Nepal hasn’t been able to do well against them because they haven’t had the exposure that the U-19 teams from test playing nations have. He says that young players hardly play as many matches as the young boys from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh.
“For most of us, it is straight into the camp after which we leave to play a tournament. It’s not easy doing that cause you’re facing bowlers who bowl at 140s and batsmen who are far better than what we’ve been facing.”
That is why he believes that is the reason why many young players struggle when they make the jump to the national team. Sarraf also feels that most young players are not honest and don’t work as hard as much as they should. While he understands that Nepal doesn’t have the infrastructure but he looks up to senior players like Paras Khadka and Shakti Gauchan who took Nepali cricket to new heights without complaining much.
“We know that we don’t have facilities in Nepal but what we need to do is make sure we are giving our 100 per cent. I practise every day because I have high hopes. I want to be the best player Nepal has seen. I want to perform with both bat and ball. If I don’t work hard these things aren’t possible.”
But he doesn’t feel many young players in Nepal share the same feeling. He says that most of them are distracted and need to work hard if they want to make it into the national team and take it to new heights.

For Sarraf, this is the last time he will be playing for the U-19 team and for him, there would be no other way to bow out than to win the coveted title.
“Most players in the group have been together for the past two years. We’ve seen many highs and many lows but me and Rohit (Paudel) always hoped to win the Asia cup. That’s always been the dream and I hope we work hard enough to make that dream a reality.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/aim-is-to-win-the-asia-cup-pawan-sarraf.html,sports

"Nepal’s ‘parkour king’ made two world records in one year. Now, he wants to leave the country","Wednesday, July 17, 2019","
Jumping around the terraces of farmlands in his village in Khotang district of eastern Nepal, Dinesh Sunar didn’t know that one day the skill he picked up as a child would help him set not one, but two world records.
“I recall people telling me to stop jumping around like a monkey. They said that I’d hurt myself, but look at me now! I have two world records to my name and am now on the verge of getting the third,” he says.
Sunar, arguably, is the ‘king’ of a jumping sport called parkour in the country.
He grew up in Kathmandu. As his parents would work for a garment factory, he could go to sand mines nearby, and spend time jumping around with his friends, somersaulting and rolling around.
“I didn’t have a clue that I was doing parkour. I was just having fun. For the most part of my life, I thought I was doing gymnastics,” he shares.
But at the age of seven, he had to go back to his village in Khotang after his father left for Qatar. But that didn’t stop him from doing what he loved.
“Going back to my village gave me a chance to polish my skills. The terraces of paddy fields and the hills were perfect to develop my skill and that is exactly what happened. People did question me then, but I never paid much attention to them anyway.”

Slowly, people in his village started to enjoy the things that Sunar did. People felt that the young boy had the talent and gave him the opportunity to showcase that talent in various events. It started with school events and slowly moved to districts where he wowed everyone.
“People come to Kathmandu for opportunities but I got mine in the village.”
He says his main break came in 2010 where he caught the eye of then IGP of Armed Police Force Sanat Kumar Basnet. Basnet was in Khotang to attend a volleyball competition. That is where he saw Sunar jumping from the first floor of a school building and around the rice field. After seeing potential in the young kid, Banset asked Sunar to call him after he completed his grade 10 (SLC) examination.
After completing his SLC, Sunar didn’t think twice and boarded a bus to come to Kathmandu. He then joined the APF’s gymnastic team and started to take part in various competitions.
“It was like a dream come true. I was an athlete and was also paid. It was huge for me.”
Being a part of the APF, Sunar has won gold in various competitions. He says he enjoyed taking part in those events, but his true passion was parkour.
“I didn’t know I was doing parkour until it saw a YouTube video some years back. Even though the two sports, gymnastics and parkour, seem similar, they are completely different. I then decided to take both gymnastics and parkour hand in hand. YouTube taught me a lot about this parkour.”
Sunar then saw many parkour athletes creating world records. That made him want to create one himself. He says he wanted to make a name for himself and also wanted to put Nepal’s name in the record books.

In 2018, Sunar set a world record for the most backward somersaults against a wall in 30 seconds, managing a staggering 16 somersaults record. He also did 18 backflips to set another world record for the most twisting backflips off a wall in one minute.
After his second world record, World Freerunning Parkour Federation invited him to take part in the 2018 Parkour World Cup. Surprising everyone, he came in the 10th position there.
“Everyone was amazed that a Nepali was taking part in the World Cup. Other athletes were shocked by what I had achieved with limited resources. I was extremely proud and happy.”
He adds that even though Nepal has limited resources, the athletes here have a lot of heart and determination. After spending three months in the US, Sunar says he learnt a lot. Having never had proper training, Sunar says his time in the US was invaluable.
Sunar recently broke his own record of ‘most twisting backflips off a wall in 30 seconds’ and is awaiting confirmation from Guinness Book of World Records.

However, he feels that he needs to get away from Nepal to get better. He says living in Nepal puts him in a difficult position as most competitions take place in either Europe or the US.
“Athletes have to travel with their own money. And for me, that is not possible. It is hard to make ends meet here. Parents also complain that I don’t make enough money. So it is hard. Sometimes I feel I should just leave Nepal.”
Sunar says that his mother often questions his decision to come back from the US. But for Sunar, this is more than just money. He says he does understand that he has to help his family, but for now he has one goal – getting to perform at America’s Got Talent.
“I know hard work will pay off. But how? I have no idea.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dinesh-sunar-nepals-parkour-king-made-two-world-records-in-one-year-now-he-wants-to-leave-the-country.html,sports

Men’s Cricket World Cup: diversity must be one of the rewards of a successful tournament,"Friday, June 28, 2019","The ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup is well underway in the UK and fans of participating nations from around the cricketing world – many of whom live in the UK – are thrilling to the exploits of some of the game’s biggest stars playing in what is arguably the biggest competition the sport can offer.
England and Wales last hosted the Men’s World Cup 20 years ago. Since that time, some aspects of the game have developed substantially, while others have been seemingly more resistant to change. Among those changes, globally, we have witnessed growing interest for shorter formats – most notably T20, which is the shortest form of the game currently played internationally – and arguably, a declining appetite for test matches – at five days, the longest, most traditional format.
As hosts – and number one ranked one-day cricket team in the world in 2019 – expectations on the England team have never been higher. And, what of that England team? The starting line-ups have so far featured three black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) players in Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali, whose family origins are in Pakistan, and Jofra Archer – the team’s latest star, who was born and raised in Barbados, but who has qualified for England thanks to his father, who is English.
Rashid and Ali have been part of the England line-up throughout the period since the last World Cup in 2015, while Archer only actually qualified to play for England in March this year. This was earlier than expected, following the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB) decision to relax its residency ruling from seven to three years from January 1, 2019.
In addition to Archer’s proven on-pitch ability to take wickets and win matches, there will inevitably be discussions about his off-field ability to stoke up interest in the game among young black people. Cricket – like any sport – has to compete for participants, and the latest figures show that fewer than 280,000 people in the UK regularly play cricket, almost half of what it was 20 years ago.
In recent times, the ECB has not been shy to use the representation and success of its BAME players as part of its marketing strategies. Moeen Ali in particular – like Monty Panesar before him – has become somewhat of a cult hero among many white England supporters and is even more popular among British South Asian supporters
The ECB’s attempts to reach out to underrepresented groups was well illustrated in June 2018 when it partnered with broadcaster Sky to make the second test of England’s series against Pakistan into what they called “The Participation Test”. During the lunch interval on each day of the test, Sky showcased some of the ECB’s equality and diversity work – initiatives which ranged from shining a spotlight on disability cricket and the women’s game as well as its programmes to encourage more young people into cricket: Chance to Shine, a national charity, which aims to give more young people (mainly those in state schools) access to cricket, and All Stars, the ECB’s newest initiative aimed at getting children aged between five and eight involved in the sport.
Of particular interest to me, as someone who has been working on ethnic diversity in cricket for over a decade, was the launch of the ECB’s South Asian Action Plan. This comprises 11 points and aims to create more opportunities for South Asian communities to engage with cricket while building strong relationships between South Asian communities and the ECB, the counties and individual clubs. The plan also focuses on ways to use cricket to make a positive difference to communities.
The ECB’s strategy to engage with South Asian communities and drive up interest and participation among these groups makes sense. The Active Lives Survey shows that, overall, while people from BAME communities are no longer less likely to participate in sport than white Britons, participation by those from South Asian backgrounds in sport in general is still relatively low .
But cricket is rather different. Despite only making up approximately 11% of the overall British population, research for the ECB identified that no less than 30% of grassroots cricketers are drawn from BAME groups – and the game is particularly popular among those from South Asian communities.
But research I have been involved in suggests that ethnic diversity at grassroots level is not necessarily transferring into other aspects of the game, such as coaching.
Using information published on the websites of the 18 “first-class” counties in England and Wales, for the 2019 season – excluding those registered as overseas – only 30 of 362 male players (8.3%), ten of 106 female players (9.4%) (seven registered to one county), seven out of 118 managers/coaches (5.9%) and nine of 79 male Academy players (11.4%) were from a BAME background.
So, compared to the BAME population, these figures (excluding those related to coaching) do not immediately appear too serious. But research has consistently identified that BAME representation on the pitch is only a partial win because experiences of participation are often tinged with perceptions of exclusion and racism. Moreover, something that the ECB will be very keen to learn is how they can get more BAME groups and individuals into stadiums to follow the national and county teams.
Notwithstanding the excellent attendance figures (and anecdotally, significant diversity in attendance) for the World Cup to date, it is well acknowledged that the England cricket team struggles to garner the support of British BAME communities.
I hope the England team is successful at the World Cup – and I hope that success will have an impact on the level of interest in the sport. But we should not get carried away by assuming that increased exposure to the sport – for example, via media coverage (which is, sadly, mostly hidden behind a Sky pay wall) – and increased interest in the sport will necessarily lead to increased numbers of players, coaches, spectators or volunteers.
What cricket – and any sport – needs is commitment and resources from the top, not to mention a workforce that is skilled in and knowledgeable about the communities it serves to take advantage of the unquestionable potential of events like the Cricket World Cup.

Men’s Cricket World Cup: the story of the Afghanistan team and why it’s such a crowd pleaser,"Thursday, June 20, 2019","
The latest data from the Office of National Statistics estimates there were about 76,000 people identifying as Afghan nationals living in the UK. When their cricket team played their first match in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup on June 1, it must have felt to their Australian opponents as if a fair proportion of that population had come to Bristol to cheer their team on.
As it turned out, Australia – a giant of the cricket world who have won the World Cup five times – beat Afghanistan quite easily, as expected. But the spirit in which the Afghanis played and the ebullience of their supporters in the crowd won them many friends among neutrals, who were quite happy to cheer them on against the “old enemy” from down under.

To some, the inclusion of Afghanistan on the world sporting stage may come as a surprise, as the country is more popularly known for its long history of war, conflict and colonial and imperial rule than sporting prowess. But this is its second men’s World Cup tournament and the national team won many admirers for the way in which it beat Scotland in the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand.
Like most countries that were former territories of the British Empire, cricket was played in Afghanistan during the 19th century but the the Afghan Cricket Federation – now known as the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) – wasn’t formed until 1995. The Taliban lifted its ban on cricket in 2000 and the first national team was formed.
The team has been more recently supported by powerful political groups, such as the Hezb-eIslami/Gulbuddin (HiG), which congratulated the team after a victory against Pakistan. Before a 2012 one-day international between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Taliban representatives contacted the ACB to offer support. These groups perhaps saw cricket as a way to demonstrate the legitimacy of their regime, locally and globally.
From 2001, the team quickly progressed and made the semi-final of the Asian Cricket Council Trophy in 2006. In April 2009, Afghanistan gained one-day international status – an incredible achievement in just eight years which they justified with their World Cup win over Scotland in 2015.
In 2017, Afghanistan was awarded full member status of the ICC and played its first test match in 2018, losing heavily to India, one of the game’s giants. But they recovered to win a one-off test against Ireland in March 2019. Playing in test “whites” is significant as it reflects a form of acceptance on to cricket’s world stage.
But this appearance as being global equals in cricketing terms masks underlying tensions between former colonial powers and colonised countries about how cricket should be played. What forms of cricket are most valued – test cricket or limited overs competitions – remain contested, with the Western countries tending to value the longer form of the game and with Asian countries generally preferring one-day cricket.
As part of the shift in dominance in the game – and the growing power of the Asian countries, the Asian Cricket Council has helped support the Afghan team alongside the ICC providing funding to support the development of cricket in the region. Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India – which recently offered use of training facilities in Uttar Pradesh – have supported the development of the Afghan team, which strengthens cricket in the South Asia region. At grassroots level, The Afghan Connection, a UK based charity, has – in partnership with the MCC – supported cricket development in Afghanistan by building pitches and training coaches.
Cricket as a metaphor for the Afgan nation was played out in the BBC’s 2012 film Afghan Cricket Club – Out of the Ashes. Despite unstable political conditions in Afghanistan, the film follows men learning to play the cricket and documents their friendships, passion and humour. Cricket was portrayed as the vehicle through which against all the odds, as refugees living in makeshift camps in Pakistan, these men found hope, salvation and a reason to feel proud of their nation.
This popular metaphor offers a romantic view that cricket is the way to bring peace to Afghanistan. Globally, the success of Afghan cricket has captured public imagination because of Afghanistan’s perceived inferiority globally – in cricketing and socioeconomic terms – to the West. Beating “them”, the former imperial and colonial nations, at their own game, mirrors broader power struggles that ordinary Afghans across the diaspora negotiate and challenge on a daily basis.
Despite its popularity in Afghanistan, cricket does not embrace everyone. Women’s cricket is not supported by the state or any other social institution. A women’s cricket team was formed in 2010 but disbanded in 2014 by the ACB, partly due to lack of funds and also due to death threats which threatened the girls and women’s safety.
In this context girls and women continue to organise their own teams and they play cricket to challenge ideas of Muslim female fragility, and create their own spaces to play on their own terms. This is why the ICC has granted Afghanistan full test status, despite regulations which state that new member nations must have a women’s national team to be eligible. This exception reproduces gender inequalities and is contradictory to the ICC’s commitment to the global development of women’s cricket.
On Tuesday June 18 at the Old Trafford cricket ground in Manchester, 19,000 spectators attended and millions more watched and listened on TV and radio. Many of these were Afghan fans hoping to see their team excel against England – the host country and favourite to win the competition. The match evoked media narratives about peace, war and ongoing conflict – but even if history is made on the cricket pitch, and huge celebrations follow, we need remember the Afghan people and their ongoing day-to-day realities beyond the boundary.

Shubham Shrestha: This multiple national record holder is eager to earn int’l medals,"Sunday, May 26, 2019","Shubham Shrestha picked up swimming when he was 10 years’ old. When he started, he just swam to have fun. But past seven years have been a roller coaster for Shrestha, who has competed in South Asian Games, Asian Games and is the national record holder for 50, 100 and 200 metres breaststrokes.
He is now working hard to earn some international medals as soon as possible.
Shrestha shares that he only swam during the summer with his sisters at the swimming pool in Tripureshwar. Coincidentally, even the national team trained there and officials were keenly observing young Shrestha. As he got better, he started to get noticed.
“The swimming coaches felt that I had it in me and asked me to join the junior team. They saw me take part in a few interschool swimming tournaments and offered me a chance to compete at the highest level with the senior team,” says Shrestha.
Shrestha’s first event at the senior level was at the 2016 Asian Games in Guwahati.
“I remember it like yesterday. I was a nervous wreck. Was only 14 and didn’t have proper training because Nepal didn’t have a heated pool, which is why I went to Chandigarh to practice, so I could get accustomed to the Indian conditions.”
Shrestha feels that senior teammates and trainers helped him out a lot during his first international tournament.
“It was my first time away from family. But the entire team motivated me and kept me focused. They told me to be myself and not worry about the results. However, I was in panic and did leave my swimsuit in the hotel one day,” he says.
His first South Asian Games didn’t go as planned but he didn’t take it badly and continued to work hard. After Guwahati, Shrestha then took part in the short course 2016 FINA World Swimming Championship in Canada. That exposed him to international swimmers whom he says were miles better than him then.
“Their build was strong, and with proper infrastructure, I felt I could never beat them. Nevertheless, after competing in the tournament, I got the confidence and the motivation to work even harder.”
Shrestha’s hard work paid off during the 2017 National Championship where he won a gold and created national records in all three categories he took part in – 50 m, 100 m and 200 m breaststrokes.
“I was ecstatic as were my friends and family. All my hard work paid off, but I knew that I would have to work even harder to take the next step.”
By the time he was in high school, he was already a national champion, but Shrestha craved for more. He wanted an international medal. In a search for that, he left for the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia.
Even though he didn’t win anything, he says the experience he got there was invaluable.

He says he learnt from other swimmers about diet and fitness, which he thinks were keys. He took that experience to the 8th National Games held in Nepalgunj where he took part in 50 m, 100 m and 200 m breaststroke events along with the 4 x 100 relay. He secured gold medals in all individual categories creating a national record in all and got a silver medal in the 4 x 100 m relay.
“This year, I felt I was in a good shape the training paid off and I was able to create a record in all three categories,” he adds.
Now, he is looking forward to the South Asian Games taking place in Nepal. He hopes that he will be able to get his first international medal during the event due to take place in December this year.
For that, he has been training every day for the past one year. He shares that his everyday training includes time on the pool, gym and outdoor exercises. He has just finished his high school and has dedicated his entire day to getting himself ready for the games.

“It is a must because South Asian athletes are quite good. We can’t take it for granted. The US swimming team trains together for one whole year before taking part in the Olympics. We haven’t been doing that, but the least we can do is try.”
Shrestha adds that he and his teammates are desperately waiting for the swimming pool in Satdobato to be ready.  The heating pool will mean that the athletes can train during the colder seasons and get a feel of what they will feel during the main event in December.
“We know it won’t be giving us a massive advantage, but it’ll be an advantage nonetheless.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/shubham-shrestha-this-multiple-national-record-holder-is-eager-to-earn-intl-medals.html,sports

"Talk to ICC and solve Nepal cricket crisis, Paras Khadka urges govt","Thursday, May 2, 2019","Kathmandu, May 2
Nepal’s national cricket team captain Paras Khadka has appealed to the government to talk to the International Cricket Council and solve the ongoing stalemate in the national cricket.
Owing to unnecessary political pressures in the national cricket governing body, the ICC suspended the Cricket Association of Nepal’s membership in April 2016.
Speaking at a function organised at the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Kathmandu on Thursday, the captain said Nepal already lost a lot due to the suspension; hence, it should end at the earliest.
“The [Sports] Minister and the [National Sports Council] Member Secretary should talk to the ICC to lift the suspension. CAN should exist in order to retain our one day international status. Further, we have to go much above.”
Minister Jagat Bahadur Bishwakarma addressed the function after Khadka, He, however, did not mention anything about the suspension.
NSC Vice-Chair Pitambar Timalsina, however, said efforts were underway to lift the suspension.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/talk-to-icc-and-solve-nepal-cricket-crisis-paras-khadka-urges-govt.html,sports
Skipper Paudel hopeful of Nepal’s berth in ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2020,"Thursday, April 11, 2019","Nepal’s young cricketers have already left for Malaysia for the ICC U-19 World Cup Cricket Asia Qualifier taking place in Malaysia from Friday. Nepal will lock horns with the hosts Malaysia, UAE, Singapore, Kuwait and Oman, eyeing the overall victory so as to open the door to the World Cup to be held next year.
Nepal national cricket team’s reliable middle order batsman Rohit Kumar Paudel is skippering the U19 team for the first time. In this context, Onlinekhabar has talked to Paudel, on the possibility of winning the qualifier.
You are playing as the captain for the first time. What is the difference between a captain and a player?
You have greater responsibilities as a captain. He plays a key role to take the team forward. He has to think of every aspect, like how batsmen can make better scores and how bowlers can coordinate to ensure a victory. In this new responsibility, I am focused on making the players free of stress. The better I can do, the better my team performs.
Are you confident of taking Nepal to the World Cup under your captaincy?
Four members of our team also play for the national team, but all of us are experienced. We have been playing together for past two to three years. Therefore, I am confident that we will win the regional qualifier and qualify for the World Cup.
We have a great opportunity under my captaincy. I am determined to utilise it properly. I cannot miss this chance.
Which team are your biggest threats?
All teams are equal. But, we have perceived that the UAE are the strongest. They have made some changes in the team formation. They scored 270 runs against us in a match played in Bangladesh. They are our biggest threats, but we can defeat them.
We have improved some of our weaknesses of late. All the players are confident.
Your arch rivals were Afghanistan, but they are not playing the qualifier this time. Hence it must be easy for Nepal to qualify.
We used to lose to Afghanistan because we did not have much experience and preparations then. But, we have prepared for the tournament quite well.
Since the last edition of Dhangadhi Premier League, we have been playing regularly. All of us are in a good form. We will play for the victory.
Recently, your team visited India for preparations. Did that help you anyway?
We stayed in India in 15 days and played six good matches. We played with good teams.
Some of our players are new and I believe the India trip helped them effectively. We played in a different climate. Now, the players are used to that temperature, which is almost same in Malaysia. One of our intentions was to get familiar with the climate and weather.
All the players have performed well in the preparations.
You mean the team are stronger than early days now?
I think the team are more balanced now. In the past, we had only two players who played for the senior team: Dipendra Singh Airee and Sandeep Lamichhane. Now, we have four national players. It means we are stronger now.
What is your expectations from the new players?
We have four new players. All of them have performed well in their matches. I expect a lot from them. They can play decisive roles in the team’s victory.
Nepali cricket’s major problem has been batting in all age groups. How much have you improved?
We have improved in both batting and bowling. Our players are all rounders, some of them are fast bowlers like Kamal Singh Airee and Rashid Khan. Likewise, there are spinners like Sagar Dhakal, Surya Lama and Pawan Sarraf. Let’s see how they will play in the ground.
What factors assure you that Nepal will qualify for the World Cup?
The first is batting. If our batsmen play their roles, we can make good scores. It makes the bowlers easy. The India trip has boosted the confidence of our batsmen. Top and middle order batsmen can score a century each.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/skipper-paudel-hopeful-of-nepals-berth-in-icc-u19-cricket-world-cup-2020.html,sports

Kathmandu, March 22
Nepal is aiming to made history by beating rivals and defending champions India in the final of the SAFF Woman’s Championship on Friday.
This will be another chance for Nepal to beat India who have not won any match in any edition of the SAFF Women’s Championship. Nepal’s four losses in the competition have all come against India, three in the finals (2010, 2012, 2014) and one in the semifinal (2016).
However, coach Hari Khadka believes that the women are ready to create history by winning the trophy in their home soil.
“They are a strong team and we know that, but we are ready for this challenge. All the girls are ready for this and want to win it more than ever. I believe we will be title holders tomorrow,” shares Khadka.
India’s journey to the final of this competition has been relatively easy, scoring 15 goals in three games. India beat the Maldives 6-0 in the first game followed by a 5-0 win against Sri Lanka in their second. In the semifinals, India cruised past Bangladesh 4-0 to reach their fifth straight final.
Nepal have not had a bad tournament either. Scoring 10 goals in their three games, Nepali players have looked quite good during this year’s tournament. Nepal beat both Bhutan and Bangladesh 3-0 in the group stage and eased past Sri Lanka 4-0 to reach the final.
Nepal’s recent record against India isn’t too bad either. In the past two games, Nepal have beaten India once and played out a draw in the other.
The coach believes that the recent results will give the girls a lot of heart while competing against favourites India in the final.
The final will take place at the Shaheed Rangashala in Biratnagar at 3 PM.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/saff-womens-championship-nepal-hope-for-breaking-the-india-jinx.html,sports

Pangro: An initiative to grease the wheels of outdoor adventure,"Thursday, March 14, 2019","
Diwas Lal Pradhan, Chakshu Malla and Sailendra Dangol cofounded Pangro in 2014 with the aim of solving problems of common bicycle riders and fill a market gap. But since then, they have changed their vision and now focus on creating a platform for outdoor adventure lovers in the country.
“We started by selling gloves in our paper bag at Basecamp Restaurant,” shares Pradhan. “As we commuted on our bicycles, we knew that there were a lot of problems people were facing in Kathmandu, which is why we first started to sell gloves, reflectors and helmets which could be used by everyday riders.”
But they soon realised that selling items and maintaining inventory were time consuming and they weren’t really making a lot of profit. Hence they stopped selling items and decided to get into event management.
“While volunteering at various events for Cycle City Network, we had realised that our strength was events, which is why we stopped selling items and worked at organising better outdoor events,” shares Dangol, adding that both him and Pradhan also took part in various running and mountain biking events.
Taking part in these races, Pradhan and Dangol realised that most events were managed poorly and the organisers didn’t care about the athletes. That drove both of them to start managing events so that the athletes were looked after well and would come to participate in the future events.
They started the event management with Laxmi Cares Mountain Bike Ride, which got them good response and the contract to manage Himalayan Outdoor Festival.
“We have been managing Himalayan Outdoor Festival from 2013 and Godavari Running Festival from 2014; and each year, I think we are improving and getting more and more participants,” adds Pradhan.
When Pangro started managing Godavari running festival in 2014, they got 20 teams. But this year they got over 60 teams. “We had to say no to teams because we didn’t have space. One team came all the way from Dubai to take part in the event so this must mean we are doing something right,” adds Dangol.
Pangro since its inception has also been the administrative and management partner for Asian Enduro Series 2016-17, Prodigy MTB 2016-17, Showdown Dharan 2015, Tansen Ultra 2015, and Nakhipot Urban XC 2015. But they feel that they are still a work in progress.
“Outdoor events is our strength. Our team comprises of mountain bike coaches, IT professionals, photographers and medics who all are passionate about outdoor adventure. All of us in our team are working to host events which are different from others,” continues Dangol.


Pangro’s aim now is to create a platform for cycling lovers and in the future want to create a cycling hero/celebrity. They believe doing that will make it easier to involve people into cycling.
“What happened to trail running after Meera Rai came into limelight with the help of Himalayan Outdoor Festival; we want to do the same with cycling. That way, the sport can improve which will be beneficial for the country as well,” adds Pradhan.
They add that they want to create amateur athletes so that the adventure sports in the country get more participation. Currently, it is the same group of athletes taking part in almost all event happening the country.
“Majority of the athletes are working together and training together. Most of them are tour guides involved in mountain biking and rock climbing. No one trains as hard as them or spends as much time training as them,” adds Dangol. He feels that the country needs more amateur athletes who can compete with the best in Nepal.
Pangro, with the help of their events, has also helped these athlete network. The Himalayan Outdoor Festival, for example, has been a great place for athletes to come and meet people from different walks of life. They also meet future clients who then go on mountain biking and rock climbing treks with them.

“I’ve seen the contestants come up with new ideas. One started fast trekking, which has been receiving a lot of praise in recent times,” shares Pradhan.
They also want to make their event inclusive so that everyone comes to participate. Pradhan adds that they don’t want only national level athletes to participate, because that would mean no one else would come. “We want people to come and have fun during the events. We want to spread the message that outdoor events are fun and that everyone can come and take part in it,” he adds.

They also share that they want to do a cycling race in the valley every week which will give the riders a platform to test themselves and train with the best and develop a competitive spirit. Pangro also has plans to give interested people mountain bike training and also teach them about first aid and managing bikes which will definitely be helpful if riders plan to embark on trekking with on their bikes.
They believe more people need to do so because mountain biking and rock climbing can also help the tourism industry boost in Nepal. “Many come to Nepal to trek, but people are also coming to Nepal for mountain biking and rock climbing adventure. And our job here is to help create more and more people which will help cater to the needs of these adventure lovers,” shares Dangol.

Tilak Pun Magar took up archery eight years ago. Now he’s Nepal’s number one,"Sunday, February 24, 2019","
Tilak Pun Magar, 26, practices with Nepal’s Archery Team at a makeshift range at the Armed Police Force’s Headquarters in Halchowk. Of the 10 arrows he fires, 8 hit the bullseye but Magar isn’t excited. “I wanted all 10 to hit the target,” he says adding “When you’re Nepal’s number one Archer, there is no room for complacency.”
Magar’s rise in archery, in his own words, is ‘coincidental’. Magar, who spent his childhood in Pokhara, went to India after completing his SLC. But due to problems in the family, he had to come back to Nepal. That decision proved vital as it paved way for a new career.
“When I came back, I had no idea what to do. One day I met a friend of mine Dev Pun. He had some archery equipment with him. Curious, I asked him about the sport and he introduced me to my teacher Kishor Gurung.”
Even though the cost of the archery equipment was beyond Magar’s capacity, that didn’t stop him. He kept on learning and working hard when one day Gurung, looking at Magar’s determination gifted him an archery set.
“It was a beginners’ set, but it was helpful. I owe him a lot,” he adds. With the set and guidance provided by Gurung, Magar took part in his first national-level junior archery tournament in 2013 and won gold.
The following year, he participated in the senior category and won one set against an experienced competitor. This gave him the confidence that he could compete with the best. “That set win gave me added confidence that I could participate with others, however, I knew that I had to work hard and I needed better equipment.”
However, in 2015, after pressure from family and his realisation that there was no future in archery, he decided to take a break and join Nepal Police as Assistant Sub-Inspector.
In 2016 after getting into Nepal Police, he decided to give archery one last go. “I asked my seniors if I could peruse archery and represent Nepal Police in various tournaments. First, they told me that they couldn’t buy me equipment as it cost too much. But when I told them, I had the required equipment, they said I could peruse archery again.”
Even though he received permission, he then faced another problem – where to train. “It was quite tough at first but when I got into the national team it started to get easier.”
Magar first got into the national team when he stood fourth in the 2017 national archery competition. The fourth position meant he was included in the national team and started to train with the national team under the guidance of Deepak Raj Gurung, who is also the President of Nepal Archery Association.
He then also started to represent Nepal in international tournaments. “In 2018 I went to Bangkok and Dhaka. My performances in both tournaments were not up to the mark and I knew I had to work hard if I was to win any medal for Nepal.”
However, in the same tournament in Dhaka, he was part of a mix-team event in which Nepal did manage to win a bronze medal which he says is one of the most important medals of his career.
“Me and Junu Awale were in the team and the game went to a tiebreaker. We won by two points. I still remember it like it was yesterday.”
In 2018, Magar was back in Dhaka, this time taking part in the 2nd ISSF Solidarity Archery Championship where he was a part of a mix-team which won a silver medal. “The news that we won silver was reported by the media and after hearing that my parents were very proud of me.”
He also took part in the 2018 Asian Game in Indonesia where he achieved his career best when he scored 649 out of 720. But he lost out in the round of 16.
“It’s not easy competing away from Nepal. We have the same equipment and training method, but what we lack in is mental strength and training facility.”
His thoughts are echoed by his coach and President of Nepal Archery Association, Deepak Raj Gurung. “When I train them I teach them techniques and give them points on how to improve their game. I show them videos of champions and tell them to follow their techniques but what I cannot do is tell them what the champion is thinking before releasing his arrow. The mental aspect of an archer is just important. If you don’t have that you are not going to go far.”
Magar currently is training with his teammates and coach Gurung either at the Armed Police Force’s shooting range in Halchowk or the Army’s in Lagankhel. Both Magar and Gurung share that the army and Armed Police have been extremely supportive.
“We hope Magar and the rest of the team bring a medal or two in the SAG. But our main aim is to do the nation proud in the 2020 Olympic,” adds Gurung.
But the team has other matters at hand before that. Magar and his national teammates are currently in Bangladesh taking part in the 3rd ISSF Solidarity Archery Championship after which they will be going to Bangkok to participate in Archery Asia Cup.
“Both tournaments are important for me. They will affect my ranking as well. I hope by the end of the two tournaments I will better my ranking which currently stands at 228.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tilak-pun-magar-took-up-archery-eight-years-ago-now-hes-nepals-number-one.html,sports
Shivaram Shrestha: From a caddy to Nepal’s number one golfer,"Tuesday, February 19, 2019","
Staring at golfers playing golf from the fences of the Royal Nepal Golf Course, Shivaram Shrestha always hoped he could one day play the ‘sport of the rich’. While most of his friends played football, Shrestha spent his time playing golf with his make-shift club on his barren land.
“When I was young I could never dream of playing on a golf course. My father used to work there and he used to get me golf balls with which I played on our barren land. First I made a club with tree branches but that it wasn’t easy to play with so I used metal rods and water pipes to make clubs.”
Shrestha, who is now Nepal’s most recognised golfer, shares that the credit goes to his father. “My father used to point at hole number three and tell me that our ancestral home was right there. This is why sometimes I feel I was destined to be a golfer.”
By 13, Shrestha thanks to his father, landed the job as a ball boy and by 16 he had become a caddy. As a caddy, he also got an opportunity to take part in the annual Caddy Championship. “I played with real golf clubs which was an amazing experience. My fellow caddies and other golfers appreciated my game as I finished in the top 20; I also won a cash prize.”

Having realised that the game brought both fame and money, Shrestha then started to work hard for other caddy championships. Every year his performance in the tournament got better. On his fourth championship things changed.
“I think that tournament lifted my career. I finished the tournament under-par which in golfing terms is really good. My performance during that tournament got me a lot of attention.”
Watching Shrestha during the tournament was Tashi Ghale, an instructor at the course. Ghale had been watching him for a few months and felt that Shrestha had it in him to become a golfer. “I owe a lot to Tashi sir. He is the one who gave me a belief that I could make it as a golfer. He helped me get sponsors and also took me to various countries to improve my game.”
Along with Ghale, he also received guidance from an international golfing instructor Aaron Baldman. Baldman, during his trip to Nepal, noticed Shrestha training alone at the Royal Nepal Golf Course. After testing Shrestha for a few hours, Baldman decided to take him under his wing.
“Aaron sir’s confidence in me was quite motivating. He wanted to coach me and that gave me a lot of belief to get better. He asked Tashi sir to take me to Thailand and I kept going there for a few years. I trained with him for two years and that shaped me to who I am today.”
Shrestha also adds that thanks to Ghale and Baldman, he got to train on better golf courses and that training helped him win his first tournament. “When I won my first tournament as a professional, it was amazing. The winning put is something I still remember to this date. It still gives me goose bumps.”
He took part in many tournaments around Asia from 2007 till 2015 winning around 20 tournaments. However, that stopped after his sponsors stopped helping him. “A golfer like me who doesn’t come from a rich family needs help and when that help stopped, I had to stop taking part in international tournaments.”
However, he does take part in tournaments in Nepal and the ones in which he takes part he wins it almost every time. He shares that his peers tell him that he should be handed the trophy as he is unbeatable, but I want to be challenged. “The competitor in me wants to be challenged and beaten so I can come back stronger.”
“It’s not easy for a common man to get into golf here in Nepal. I was lucky because I was part of this course thanks to my father. I worked on the golf course and that gave me the chance to learn play and get better. Not everyone is as lucky as I am.”
Shrestha, who has been Nepal’s number one golfer for 11 years, feels that he still has a long way to go. “Golf has given me fame and money and I couldn’t ask for anything more. I do want a house and a good bank balance, but I cannot say that I am not happy.”
“I still have room for improvement. I’m 34 right now and I’ve seen people play till they’re 60 that’s what I aim to do as well because is not just a sport for me. It is my life.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/shivaram-shrestha-from-acaddy-to-nepals-number-one-golfer.html,sports

DPL 3: Know your teams and players,"Friday, February 8, 2019","
The third edition of Dhangadhi Premier League, which has played a key role in developing cricket in Nepal, is starting this Saturday. Like always, a lot is being talked about who will come out on top and what the fans can expect from the tournament.
Unlike the previous two tournaments, which were played at the SSP Cricket ground, tthe tournament moves to Dhangadhi Cricket Academy’s Phapla International Cricket Stadium this year.
The organisers of the tournament say that all preparation is complete and add that the grandstand, which can accommodate up to 6,000 fans is also ready.  To ensure that all matches are entertaining, the ground staff have prepared five pitches for the tournament.
“Everything is ready and now we are excited and raring to go. We’re glad that the tournament will be held at the proposed Phalpa International Stadium this time, which we had always dreamed,” shares President of Dhangadhi Cricket Academy, Suwas Shahi.

This year, DPL organisers this year are also giving the fans a chance to win gift hampers and money. If anyone in the crowd pulls off a catch in the stand, s/he will be rewarded with a cash prize of Rs 10,000. Similarly, a lucky winner among the ticket buyers will to win Rs 5,000.
Ticket prices for the group games are set at Rs 50. But the ticket rates for the playoffs and the final is set at Rs 70 and Rs 100 respectively.

The competition will see the same six teams fighting for the trophy. All teams have a mix of national and international players who will be looking to impress. But that said, national team captain Paras Khadka, citing personal reasons, has pulled out from the tournament.
Looking at the teams, one can’t point out a clear favourite as all teams look balanced. Here is a look at the team taking part in the tournament:
Dhangadhi Stars
Dhangadhi Stars, previously known as Team Chauraha Dhangadhi, won both editions of the DPL. Led by pacer Sompal Kami, Dhangadhi will be looking to make it three in a row this year. The team include international players like Rohan Mustafa from the UAE and Sagar Trivedi from India, who will be looking to bolster the side.
Dhangadhi’s strength is its batting. They have players who have done well in domestic T20 leagues like Saurav Khanal, Sunil Dhamala, Raju Rijal, Amit Shrestha and Pawan Sarraf. However, when it comes to bowling, the team is heavily dependent on captain Kami.
Kathmandu Goldens
Gyanendra Malla-led Kathmandu Goldens can be seen as an average team. Looking from the outside, the Goldens’ team do not seem to have a good batting line up. However, their bowlers can turn any game in their favour.
Coach Raju Basnet says that his team will be vying for the title. He feels that the team are composed as they have a lot of spin options in the form of Lalit Narayan Rajbanshi and Rasheed Khan. The batting, on the other hand, isn’t as great and the team will have to depend on runs from captain Gyanendra Malla and Indian player Gaurav Tamor.
Biratnagar Kings
Skippered by Karan KC, Biratnagar Kings have a lot of young players in their team. This will be KC’s first time leading a team. Kings’ batting looks strong with big hitters like Aarif Sheik, Rajesh Pulami and Hari Shankar Shah. ‘Forgotten’ Nepali cricketer Prithu Baskota will also be looking to play well in the tournament. The Kings will also look for inspiration from their left-arm spinner Avinash Yavad and left-handed batsman Shivakant Shukla who have played Ranji Trophy for Railways. Kings, whose bowling looks a bit weak, will have to bowl well if they have any chance at winning the tournament.

Mahendranagar United
Mahendranagar United are another strong team as they have a host of players who have represented Nepal’s national team. The team will be captained by Sharad Vesawkar and have national team players like Aarif Sheik and Rohit Kumar Paudel. All these batsmen have the ability to win the match on their own. Mahendranagar also have the experienced Mohamad Naveed to call on when it comes to bowling.
Rupandehi Challengers
The Challengers have a number of experienced players. Captained by spinner Basanta Regmi, the team have three more national team players in Binod Bhandari, Pradip Airee and Bhim Sarki. The Challengers also have the match winners like Babar Hayat who will be looking to impress again as will Pakistan’s Raza Ali Dar.
CYC Attariya
Captained by youngster Dipendra Singh Airee, Attariya’s batting and bowing is average. However, the team are full of players who have performed well in the PPL and EPL.
The team’s batting will depend on captain Airee and foreign players Jayakishan Kolswala and Sunny Patel. Sandeep Jora, who played well with the national team recently, will also be a key if CYC Attariya are to reach the playoffs. When it comes to bowing, they will be lead by Ram Naresh Giri who will be helped by Buwan Karki and Kamal Singh Airee.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dpl-3-know-your-teams-and-players.html,sports

"Plagued by injuries, Prithu Baskota is gearing up to make comeback","Thursday, February 7, 2019","
While the Nepali cricket team are celebrating their victories against the UAE in one day and T20 series, one of the forgotten names of the team is gearing up for a comeback.
Prithu Baskota, once a captain of Nepal’s U-19 team, was at one point of time dubbed the man who would help Paras Khadka take Nepali cricket to new heights. But his ‘bad luck’ with injuries has meant that he hasn’t been part of the national team for nearly four years now.
Having represented Nepal in all age groups and been involved in cricket since he was 12, Baskota feels that the injuries are part of a sportsperson’s career. “I’ve been unlucky with my share of injuries; but I think these things happen to many athletes. You can call it bad luck or fate, I have to accept and move on,” he says.
Baskota, who made his national team debut in 2010, first suffered a knee injury during the closed camp before the 2014 World T20 Qualifiers. He twisted his knee during warm up and later found out that he had his ligament torn. It was since then that injuries applied a handbrake to his cricketing career.
Two months after the treatment on his knee, he returned to play cricket and by 2014 he was back into the national team squad for the 2015 World Cup Qualifiers. However, the tournament did not go as planned for Nepal and Baskota.
While Nepal struggled for wins, Baskota struggled to maintain his fitness. In the last match against Uganda, Baskota injured the same knee when he collided with Sharad Vesawkar. Baskota, who was batting on 61, had to retire hurt and his dream of representing Nepal in the World T20 in Bangladesh took a massive blow.
“While the rest of the team continued to take part in Nepal’s biggest tournament to date, I had to sit at home. It was quite heartbreaking at that moment,” explains Baskota.
That injury forced him to operate his knee and was out for over a year. But working hard, he made a comeback again in 2015 during the World Cricket League Championships in Scotland. After playing two games, he was out of the team again injuring his index finger and since then, hasn’t been part of the national team.
Baskota shares that he did not get the right medical help when he injured his finger, which forced him to stay out of the team for a long. “The doctors I went to didn’t have the same opinion. Some suggested I have the operation while some suggested I don’t. In the end, I had an operation, which didn’t go well and I was on the sidelines for more than 15 months,” he says, showing this operated finger.
By the time he was fit, his place in the team was already taken by someone else. “I had to accept that I wasn’t in the team. I was replaced by another young player who was there on merit. I had made to the national team in a similar manner,” he adds.
Baskota, however, does feel that things could have been different had it not been for those injuries. He feels that injuries make it hard for any good players to come back. He also complains that the Cricket Association of Nepal also did not provide him sufficient help for rehabilitation.
But that said, he hasn’t lost hope of the comeback. “I’ve been practising on a regular basis and also taking part in all domestic tournaments. I know I haven’t performed well in those tournaments, but I am determined to make a comeback.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/plagued-by-injuries-prithu-baskota-is-gearing-up-to-make-comeback.html,sports
Nepali cricketers need more matches at home: Patwal,"Wednesday, February 6, 2019","
Umesh Patwal is Nepali national cricket squad’s batting consultant. Patwal, who has been with the team since March 2018, hails from Mumbai, and has worked with the Afghanistan national team as well as many local youngsters. Onlinekhabar talked to Patwal after he returned to Kathmandu following the squad’s tour of the UAE, about his role and the changes he made in the team.
When you started out as a batting coach, what problems did you see in the team and how did you resolve them?
The first thing I saw was there was no local cricket. This isn’t what we expect if Nepal want to play test cricket. Domestic tournaments help players toughen up and help build training patterns. I, as a coach, felt that the players didn’t have a proper training pattern because of a lack of match practice.
So the first thing I did was to tell them about ways to develop and understand their basic training patterns. Then we moved on to the thinking pattern which could give the batsmen an edge against other competitors.
Batting has as much to do with the mind as the muscles and if we look at the batting greats, all of them have been fit, both physically and mentally. I also feel the Nepali boys lack a ‘game sense’. They are aware of the game but lack that sense, which teaches them what shot to play and when. That will only develop by playing more and more cricket.
The players need to form a habit that can only come after training for a few years.
How much information did you have about the details of the team composition when you started your role?
I have always been a keen observer of the Nepali squad as I’ve been involved in the game for a long time. I was impressed with Nepal’s cricket team when I was part of Afghanistan setup. I always felt that Nepal was one of the best bowling units around at the associate level. I’ve also known Gyanendra and Sarad–both of them have worked with me before. So I’d say I knew a lot about Nepali cricket before starting out.
What are the major differences between Afghanistan and Nepal?
I think there are massive differences. Firstly, as Afghanistan played a lot of cricket in Pakistan they received a lot of exposure. Nepal hasn’t had that level of exposure. As the Afghans did not receive proper coaching in their initial years, they played free-flowing cricket which meant they could hit the ball hard and long. But that isn’t the case here in Nepal where people talk a lot about developing a technique and not playing naturally. Back in Afghanistan, they also play a lot of tape ball cricket which I don’t see boys in Nepal do.
Are young players in Nepal different from players in India where you’ve coached youngsters?
The young players are the same and have the same passion and want to play their best. But the main difference is the level of competitive cricket they get to play. For example in Mumbai, a young player plays three- day cricket from the age of 13. This type of exposure and under-pressure match situations give Indian youngsters the competitive edge.
In Nepal, there is only T20 cricket and the odd 50-over tournament which doesn’t help the batsmen improve their game. And Nepali players hardly play cricket throughout the year. They just play for around six months.
Similarities between the attitude of players in emerging teams like Afghanistan and Nepal?
There are a lot of similarities. Both want to win and are passionate to win. They also have tremendous support from back home which gives the players the added motivation. You can see the passion in Nepali players. These guys haven’t been paid for two years, but they are still playing. This shows how
much they love the game. The manner at which the team has received ODI status is quite commendable.
We saw a lot of new faces in the team this series. Which player impressed you most?
To be honest, I wasn’t impressed by any particular new face. None of them had a good series. But that said, I was impressed by the character of the team. Bhim Sarki didn’t play a game but he didn’t show that. He was happy to be a part of the team, which is key. Team unity is important if you want to take cricket forward.
Talking about a player in particular, I think I was impressed by the captain. He scored a 100 under immense pressure that too after bowing 10 overs in back to back games. He did it when his team needed it the most. I feel that was the turning point in the series.
What was your highlight this series?
The major highlight was Nepal winning the series. But apart from that, I think the team bonding was another highlight. This series wasn’t about individuals it was a team effort. We know the players have passion and the will to win but the manner at which we bounced back to win both the series is down to team spirit.
Was changing the line-up pre-planned?
Yes, it was. We had planned everything before going to the UAE. We had planned that Malla would open with Bhandari in the ODIs and Paras would open with Pradeep in the T20s.
How have you addressed the problems in Nepal’s opening combination?
We have given every batter points on how to improve their game. Everyone has batting pattern which needs improving and we have tried to do exactly that. The patterns and habits will only change after they work on their weakness and that will take some time. These players lack confidence.
Binod, for example, didn’t perform as well as I’d have liked but he will continue as the team’s opener. Same is the case with Pradeep. We have to show confidence in players. I feel that Nepal had been changing the opening combo a lot and that doesn’t help the players’ confidence. Plus there are no local tournaments to go and see if they were performing well or not. Too much experiment was done and I don’t believe in experiments.
We prepared both Pradeep and Binod during the closed camps in Kathmandu where we told them the amount of time that they would need to bat. Even made them run a 100 runs with pads on so they would take that into consideration when playing a regular match.
What do you think about the future?
The future looks bright. Paras was telling me the other day that the ability these young players have would take Nepal cricket forward. Rohit’s knock was simply brilliant as was Johra’s. How they build on their innings and improve their game will make a difference.
You said you realised that our batting is weak. But you are leaving the team camp. What will the players do as there are hardly any tournaments? Do we have a plan?
Until a few months ago, we didn’t have plans, but luckily we have a plan in place now. We have formed a group of players who have been given specific things to work on for the next three months. I will be coming back soon.
The players need to take responsibility and work honestly to improve their game. I’ll always be one call away if they need my suggestion.
In the meeting, we talked about working with a proper plan and to make sure we have good work ethics. Paras and Gyanendra have been given the responsibility to make sure that the batters work hard on their flaws. Similarly, we have assigned Sompal and Karan to make sure the bowlers work on their flaws. This will help them learn about their flaws and strengths.
We have a lot of middle-order players who play well one game and go missing for 5-10 games. What do you think is wrong?
The problem I see with a few Nepali cricketers is that they think that know a lot of things if they score runs in a game. They don’t think they need to work hard if they make runs. But that attitude will get them nowhere. If you look at India, if a player makes runs, he will be extra motivated to work even hard
so that his spot in the team doesn’t go to someone else. We need that type of attitude from Nepali players as well. They need to perform consistently.
Why are you experimenting with bowlers giving them chance to bat higher up the order?
We used Sompal and Karan higher up the order because they are our best allrounders. But we hadn’t tested them. Which is why we tried to see if Sompal could play a long and composed innings by spending more time at the crease. His role this time was different to other times.
Most believe that our bowling is better than batting. But right now we don’t have experienced bowling options.
I think we have a very good bowling option. Avinash bowled really well as did Lalit and Binod so I feel there is depth. As for experience, it will come gradually as you play more matches.
Our plan is to get qualify both the 50 and 20-over world cups. How is the progress?
It’s too early to predict anything right now. Our focus is on the T20 World Cup qualifiers and if we get to the world cup it will big a big boost for Nepal cricket.
Nepal has ODI status Nepali fans wants to play with the likes of India and Australia. Is that feasible?
It is possible as Nepal has an ODI status until 2022. The players have put themselves on the map of world cricket. The win against the UAE on their own soil showed that Nepal have arrived. It shows they are good enough.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepali-cricketers-need-more-matches-at-home-patwal.html,sports
Sports Minister hopeful of end to CAN suspension soon,"Tuesday, February 5, 2019","Kathmandu, February 5
Nepal’s Minister for Youth and Sports Jagat Bahadur Bishwakarma says the International Cricket Council will soon end the suspension of the membership of the Cricket Association of Nepal.
The international cricket government body had suspended Nepal’s national association in 2015 citing undue political interference in the professional organisation.
But, the Minister says the government is preparing to hold an election to elect the new executive committee, which will effectively end the suspension.
A five member ad hoc committee will be announced to hold the election as per suggestions extended by the ICC, according to him.
Speaking with journalists in Kathmandu on Tuesday, the Minister said the CAN charter was recently amended in compliance with the ICC directive; whereas elected officials of the suspended committee filed an application at the court to withdraw a case they filed.
He assured that the national team members would get their salary only after the end to suspension.
Citing that Nepali cricket was improving significantly and the government was committed to its development, he urged the ICC to take a concrete decision at the earliest.
In another context, he said the ongoing construction of Mulpani cricket stadium would be complete in next two and half years.

Nepal vs UAE: Key factors that decide the Rhinos’ chance of victory,"Friday, January 25, 2019","Nepal are facing the UAE in three match ODI and T20 series commencing from Friday. The sides have played against each other regularly in ACC competitions as well as at the World Cricket League Division 2 in Namibia last February and during preparations for the World Cup Qualifier.
Even though both the teams are familiar with one another, this is the first bilateral series between two emerging cricket teams. Therefore, it will be interesting to know various dimensions of the series before predicting the possibility of Nepal’s victory.
Who will open?
There are many views about who will open alongside Gyanendra Malla for Nepal in the forthcoming series. Both Subas Khakurel and Anil K Sah have been left out of the team due to their poor form. They could be replaced by Binod Bhandari, Pradeep Airee and debutante Pawan Sarraf. However, captain Paras Khadka has hinted that he could be opening the innings with Malla. If Khadka does open, it could put immense pressure on Nepal’s weak middle order who haven’t performed well.
What will the new faces do?
The Nepal team to face UAE do not have many new names. There are four players who haven’t played for the national team. Bhim Sarki, Sandeep Jora, Avinash Bohora and Pawan Sarraf, all of whom have played for the U-19 team, will be looking to make their debuts in this series. Sarki and Johra both showed their ability with the bat during recent Pokhara and Everest premier leagues. Sarraf’s performance in other domestic T-20 tournaments with both bat and ball was impressive. Bohora, on the other hand, will give the team a pace bowling option.
Nepal will also be without senior batsman Sharad Vesawkar who pulled out of the squad due to illness. There were doubts about the fitness of fast bowler Sompal Kami, but he has now been proved fit.
How are the UAE players?
The UAE will be without captain Rohan Mustafa, Ahmed Raza and Rameez Shahzad for critical comments they made on social media during the Emerging Teams Asia Cup. The absence of top order Mustafa and Shahzad will mean that the UAE will lose a lot of top-order runs and will have to depend on Chirag Suri and Shaiman Anwar. Both Suri and Anwar haven’t been performing well in previous series and will be under pressure as the team will depend on them. However, UAE coach Dougie Brown believes that his team can cope and thrive despite the suspensions to three of their leading players.
Will home conditions mean advantage to the UAE?
Even though the UAE are missing key players, they still remain favourites due to home conditions and strength in depth. The UAE who will be captained by fast bowler Mohammed Naveed, who will be hoping for a pitch that will helps pace bowlers like Qadeer Ahmed and Amir Hayat.
A pitch which favours fast bowler will also negate the threat of Sandeep Lamichhane who is Nepal’s wicket-taking option. Nepal over the years have not played well against a good pace attack, which is why Naveed and the UAE will be looking to take advantage of Nepal’s fragile middle order.
The series will be a closely contested series, but the UAE might have an edge as they have a better bowling unit. For Nepal to stand a chance at being victorious, their openers and middle order need to step up.
All the matches will be broadcast live on Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) social media streams.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-vs-uae-key-factors-that-decide-the-rhinos-chance-of-victory.html,sports

Nepal’s ace karateka Anu Adhikari eyes SAG gold to wrap up career on high,"Sunday, January 13, 2019","
When a 12-year-old Anu Adhikari enrolled herself at a dojo to learn karate she had only one aim: to lose weight. Twelve years on, Adhikari is the national karate champion–she’s been at the top of her game for the last eight years. She’s even won a silver at the South Asian Games.
But it hasn’t been an easy ride. Her family members, even though they support her now, were never happy about her perusing sports as a career. “My father wanted me to become a staff nurse because he didn’t want me to waste time pursuing something which didn’t have any future,” shares Adhikari.
She shares that it was quite hard initially as she had to balance studies and karate, but is thankful to her brother who always helped her when it came to school work. “The dojo was quite far from home. I had to walk for 45 minutes to get there and my parents saw that was a waste of time. But as my elder brother and I were in the same class, my studies didn’t suffer as much,” she adds.
That she didn’t come from a sporting family didn’t help her cause, but she didn’t let that affect her in any way and with the help of her teachers at the dojo started to excel in karate. “The teachers always gave us hope that we could do well. They didn’t even take any fees from me and gave me a karate dress for free as well.”
After doing well in junior karate competitions, Adhikari caught the eyes on national level selectors when she participated in the National Games in 2009. At the age of 15, she was selected in the national team which was due to participate in the 2010 South Asian Games in Bangladesh.
In her debut international tournament, Adhikari narrowly missed out on a gold medal as she lost in the final to a Pakistani. “I had the game and a gold medal won, but my naivety cost me the match in the final minute of the game.”
Disheartened that she could win a gold medal, Adhikari returned home to a glorious reception. It was something she had never imagined. “I didn’t value the medal until I arrived in Nepal where I, along with others who had won a medal, got a hero’s welcome. It was quite surreal. The junior games were behind me and now I was competing with the best in Asia and South Asia,” she adds.
The 2010 SAG also gave her inspiration to work harder and stay at the top level. She represented Nepal in two more international tournaments: the 2014 and the 2018 Asian Games. However, she couldn’t to win Nepal a medal in either of the two tournaments.
“Our preparation for these international tournaments isn’t enough. The camps that we are sent to last only for a few weeks which aren’t enough,” she says.
She further adds that the techniques and skills they learn in the camps quickly disappear after the tournaments as the level of competition in the country isn’t as good as those away from home.
To ensure she gets the best training, she has been spending her own money to participate in karate tournaments across the world.
She shares that she participates in various series which help her gain ranking which will, in turn, help her get selected for the  2020 Olympics, which will include karate for the first time.
“I recently got to play with the 5th best player in the world. I got beaten but the match could have gone either way. The experiences I gather by participating in these tournaments is invaluable.”
Her goal, for now, is to win a gold medal for Nepal in the forthcoming South Asian Games which will be hosted in Nepal later in the year. ”
It’ll be fitting if I win a gold medal in my own country make everyone proud. It’s something I have dreamt of since 2010 and I want that dream to come true.”
She continues that there is even a chance of her retiring if she wins the gold medal. “Like everyone I also want to bow out on a high–a reason why I am working my socks off for this tournament.”
Adhikari adds that even though she will not participate in tournaments after her retirement she will still be involved in the game in one way or another. “This for me is like a drug. I cannot stop doing what I do which is why I plan to train young kids and make them ready for the future. Even now I teach kids in two different schools.”
For Adhikari, this isn’t just a sport. It has given her fame and respect. It has taught her discipline and developed her as a person which is why even though she had her struggles in the start she has no regrets in continuing a sport that she loves.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-ace-karateka-anu-adhikari-eyes-sag-gold-to-wrap-up-career-on-high.html,sports
Martyrs’ League: Meet the coach who guided minnows Sankata to second place finish,"Monday, January 7, 2019","
Salyan Khadgi is the head coach of Sankata Football Club, one of the oldest surviving clubs in Kathmandu. After playing for the club for over a decade, he took over the reins of the team in 2016 leading the club to Bikash Running Shield during his maiden stint as coach. Recently, Khadgi coached his team to finish second in the league, its best-ever performance in the tournament for over three decades. Onlinekhabar recently talked to Khadgi about the league season and how his team coped under pressure in the final few games.
Excerpts:
Before the season started, did you feel your team would secure second place?
At the start of the season, if someone told me we’d come second, I would have bitten his hands off! But I feel we played well this year to achieve what we did. The penultimate game against Three Star was a historic one for us as we achieved something we hadn’t dreamed of–we bounced back after conceding a goal in just four minutes. We could have settled for a draw, which would still give us an advantage heading into the last match of the season, but I felt sealing the deal with a game to go would be the better option.
Sankata’s best finish in the league was recorded 33 years ago when they won the league. After that, the team hadn’t finished in the top three. As your team was on the verge of breaking the record, what thoughts came to your mind before the penultimate game?
I would be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous. I was thinking about a lot of things because this was something none of us had imagined. People were expecting a lot from me because of the way our team had performed over the league season. Even though I was under pressure I didn’t show it to my team. I motivated my team and that is how we won the game.
Your overall performance against the big boys hasn’t been good this season. How did you overcome that?
Everyone will have doubts. After our 5-1 loss against Nepal Army people told me that this team wouldn’t even make the top five which was our original target at the start of the season. But after that game, I decided to play a bit defensively. I realised that setting up a team to play attacking football every game was wrong. Yes, it is how we want to play, but there are moments when you have to respect your opposition.
I didn’t respect the Nepal Army and that loss happened because of that. After that game, I learned a lesson to not take any team lightly and change tactics depending on the team. But the game against Manang was quite tight and I felt it could have gone either way. But I’ve learned a lot from this season and the mistakes I have made this season, I will not be repeating them.

As you don’t have any star players in your side, how much of a team effort was this?
I don’t think a good team needs star players. I know I had an average team but all my players were young and hungry. They wanted to show the country that they could play and that was an important factor in us finishing second. These players haven’t had a chance and were raring to go. They were helped by all my senior players who made sure the team always stuck together. Team captain Rabi Silwal was good this campaign. I couldn’t have asked for a better leader.  He, along with other players, motivated the young ones, especially after the game against the Army. Senior players didn’t let the younger player’s heads drop which is what you would expect from them.
Was it hard to assemble a team?
Yes, it was. It wasn’t hard just for me, but for all teams, except for the ‘departmental’ teams. The league happened after five years which resulted in a lot of players leaving the country or leaving football. That meant there were hardly any known players in the market. The only choice we had was to utilise the players that were available to us. But I feel fortunate that I was able to assemble a good team.
Was a league without relegation competitive?
A lot of people have questioned that but I felt it was quite competitive. At this point in time, all of us are thankful that league football has resumed after five years–even though this league didn’t have relegation. This season helped prepare us for next season. Some teams might have had this on the back of their head that there is no relegation which meant they didn’t need a good enough squad for this season. But most of the top teams were building teams to fight for the title. I’d say that the top was quite competitive the bottom might not have been equally competitive.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/martyrs-league-meet-the-coach-who-guided-minnows-sankata-to-second-place-finish.html,sports
Sandeep Lamichhane shines in his BPL debut,"Sunday, January 6, 2019","
Kathmandu, January 6
Nepali cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane has claimed two wickets for his side Sylhet Sixers in his Bangladesh Premier League debut against the Comilla Victorians on Sunday.
Lamichhane conceded 16 runs in the four overs taking two crucial wickets and bowling 12 dot balls to give his team the upper hand. His first victim was Pakistan’s Shoaib Malik, who was caught at mid-wicket trying to take the spinner on.
In the next over, he claimed the wicket of Bangladeshi cricketer Anamul Haque who was a victim of Lamichhane’s disguised googly. Haque tried to slog sweep Lamichhane but missed it completely losing his stumps in the process.
However, Lamichhane’s impressive work with the ball was in vain as his side lost to the Victorians by four wickets.
The star spinner was signed by the Sixers after his impressive runs in various T20 competitions in the world. He has joined the Sixers after impressing the Big Bash League in the past month.

Nepal to defer 13th SAG as Dasharath Stadium reconstruction takes time,"Wednesday, January 2, 2019","Kathmandu, January 2
Dasharath Stadium, the only international stadium in the country, will not be ready for the 2019 South Asian Games, which is scheduled to be hosted in Nepal in March 2019.
Renovation works are still going on in the stadium which was damaged in the 2015 earthquake in April 2015. No sports activity have been conducted in this multipurpose stadium following the quake.
The renovation work of the 18,000-capacity stadium started two years after the quake. Organisers doubt if the stadium will be ready to host the event in March.
National Sports Council Member Secretary Keshav Kumar Bista shares that a proposal has been made to defer the SAG by six months as the construction of physical infrastructures in the stadium has not been completed.
Bista adds that the renovation process will be complete by mid-June.
The Chinese government is extending technical assistance for the reconstruction of the stadium while the Nepal government will look after the construction of physical infrastructures.
So far 70 per cent of reconstruction works are over.
“Around 100 to 150 workers are working daily in rebuilding the stadium. It will take five to six months to complete the work,” shares chief engineer of the NSC Infrastructure and Construction Department, Arun Upadhyaya.

Young Nepali footballers don’t take the game seriously: Rohit Chand,"Thursday, December 27, 2018","
In July 2018, reports of Bimal Garti Magar and his teammates from the national football squad left their closed camp to go to a club went viral. Bored of their time in the camp, Magar along with fellow youngsters Bishal Rai, Anjan Bista, Chirring Gurung and Hemanta Thapa Magar went out from the camp and came back late at night intoxicated.
The incident happened two weeks before the team was to go play at the Asian Games in Indonesia. ANFA took little to no action and all players went on to play both the 2018 Asian games and the SAFF Championship.
For someone who joined the ANFA academy the age of 11, Rohit Chand feels that this isn’t anything new. Recently back from Indonesia, he believes that the young players in Nepal don’t take football seriously. “Some get to the national team and feel that they have achieved it all. There seems to be no determination to work hard and get to the top,” he says.
Football has changed a lot in the past decade. Players from the new generation are different compared to those from the olde times. “ANFA should start treating these kids differently,” he adds.
“The players don’t know the importance of discipline. Even though we are taught to behave from a young age, we still don’t follow it up regularly and that is the player’s fault. This is why ANFA needs to do more to make them aware of the importance of discipline.”
Chand adds that the domestic structure doesn’t help the player’s cause. “It’s really easy to put the blame on ANFA and say that they haven’t provided facilities and so on. But the players need to take a hard look at themselves and ask themselves if they want to take football seriously”.
Chand further adds that the lack of focus means that the players don’t eat well nor do they sleep on time. “All these factors are important to get better. In Indonesia, the players are dedicated to their cause. It motivates me a lot. It pushes me to work hard,” adds Chand, who was recently voted Indonesian League’s Most Valuable Player after his team Perija Jakarta’s league triumph.
“If I had stayed happy after entering the national team I wouldn’t have achieved this feat. I wanted to achieve more in my career which is why left Nepal and played in Indonesia, Malaysia, and India. I wanted to test myself which is a key part in developing as a player.”
He shares that most young players in Nepal are comfortable with what they have and believes that comfort zone kills development.
Talking about the incident in July, Chand shares that they boys were quite lucky. “This was an avoidable incident the players need to learn how to behave. I think they will not repeat this mistake again,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/young-nepali-footballers-dont-take-the-game-seriously-rohit-chand.html,sports
"During crunch situations, Nepal’s pinch hitter, Karan KC remembers win against Canada to stay motivated","Sunday, December 23, 2018","
When you tell Karan KC that he’s one of Nepal’s finest stroke-makers, he brushes it off. “I’m just a bowler,” he says. But if you watched him smash the ball during the Everest Premier League, you’d know he’s being modest.
With 56 runs needed to win from four overs and all notable batsmen back in the pavilion, KC’s mission to secure victory for Biratnagar looked impossible. To add to that, it was Sandeep Lamichhane who was bowling.
Anyone who’s not followed Nepali cricket for the last few years can be forgiven for dismissing the chasing side’s chance of a victory. But for those following the game for the last few years, a victory for KC’s side Biratnagar against the Lalitpur Patriots was not beyond their imagination.
KC proved, yet again, that he was the man his team could turn to achieve the impossible. That day, he played a match-winning innings scoring 36 runs from 18 balls. In another match of the tournament against Pokhara Rhinos, KC dragged the match into the super over and scored a match-winning 20 runs.
All this reminds, not just his fans, but also KC himself of the match against Canada during the World Cricket League Division II tournament in Namibia earlier this year. Fans remember this tournament for the role KC played in helping his side survive a Canada scare and eventually earn Nepal its ODI status. KC, who came in with 51 runs needed for victory, dragged the match to the final over and reduced the gap between the two teams to 8 runs.
“I was nervous. The bowler bowled four really good balls but I managed to connect the fifth one which went for six. I think the bowler felt the pressure and conceded a wide, which made it easy for us to take a single off the last ball and win the match.”
“So how do you manage to take the game to the final over?”
“My plan in these crunch situations is simple, spot the ball and hit it. Whenever I face these situations I remember the innings I played against Canada and it gives me a lot of confidence.” Even during the matches against the Rhinos and the Patriots, KC says he was thinking of his knock against Canada to remain positive and motivated.
In addition to that KC also remembers the praises fans bestowed on him after the win. That packs in more motivation to take the match to the last over he says. “I want to win games for my teams. The pressure is a part of it. It just gives me a chance to become a hero among the fans. I think that is what drives me forward. If I win the game I become a hero again, if I don’t there is always a next time.”
Even though KC cemented his reputation as a big hitter, his abilities weren’t enough for his team Biratnagar to make it to the finals of the tournament. But KC is happy that he now has two more matches to remember when he faces crunch situations in the future. “It’s a team game. I can’t do it all by myself and I feel we were quite unlucky too.”
KC reminds us again that he is primarily a bowler and the batting he does is just a bonus. “I am working on my bowling. I want to take more wickets in future tournaments, not just make runs,” he added.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/during-crunch-situations-nepals-pinch-remembers-win-against-canada-to-stay-motivated.html,sports
Sandeep Lamichhane bags two wickets on his Big Bash League debut,"Friday, December 21, 2018","Kathmandu, December 21
Nepali cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane has claimed two wickets for his side Melbourne Stars in his Big Bash League debut against the Sydney Thunders on Friday.
Sandeep conceded 32 runs in the four overs he bowled in tandem with fellow leg-spinner Adam Zampa. Both the wickets came in the same over for the Nepali leggie.
Lamichhane’s first victim was the former Aussie all-rounder Shane Watson who mistimed a shot straight to long on. In the same over, he also claimed the wicket of another former Aussie international Callum Ferguson. Lamichhane caught him off his own bowl.
The star spinner was signed by the Stars after his impressing runs in the Indian Premier League and  Caribbean Premier League. According to the team, Lamichhane will be available for around half way through the tournament, as he has already signed up for Bangladesh Premier League.
Lamichhane will be back in Australia to play the Big Bash League after the Bangladeshi league draws to a close in the first week of February.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sandeep-lamichhane-bags-two-wickets-on-his-big-bash-league-debut.html,sports
Himal Aryal: This wheelchair player is proving a dream shattered is not the end of life,"Thursday, December 6, 2018","
Lying on his hospital bed in 2003, Himal Aryal felt his life was over. He was unable to walk after losing his vertebral column and was going to spend the rest of his life on a wheelchair.
But Aryal, who wanted to change people’s perception on how they see ‘differently abled’ persons, showed immense mental strength to become a source of inspiration amongst his peers.
Born in Gulmi, Aryal always wanted to become an army man, which is why in 2001, the 18-year-old joined the national military force. “The Maoist insurgency was at its peak and the rebels were attacking security forces throughout the country, and I wanted to help my country. But I never thought that I would also be one of the casualties.”
After two years of his recruitment, Aryal with his mates was on a truck on the way to Makawanpur when a landmine exploded, throwing everyone in the truck in the air. “I was on the ground and felt an awful pain in my body. Everyone was on the ground wounded and in a lot of pain. Thankfully, an army helicopter rescued us and we were brought to Kathmandu.”
A week later, he woke up at the Army Hospital in Kathmandu and found out that the attack had left his lower body paralysed. “The ambush has finished my army career. The doctor said I had a broken T-12 vertebra which meant that walking again was impossible. All my hopes and dreams were shattered.”
A dream was shattered, but the life was not over yet.
He spent nearly four years in the hospital where he convinced himself that he wasn’t going to walk again. “It was hard for me to come to terms with my injury but I had to. Hence, I decided to go home to reflect on life.”
But that didn’t go quite well. When he returned home in a wheelchair, everyone talked about him being a ‘cripple’. “People who respected me now took pity on me. Even my parents were unsure how a disabled son would take care of them. It was a painful time.”
Aryal, however, didn’t let that come in the way of his recovery. While in hospital he picked up a few hobbies to keep him occupied. “I started to paint. It helped me focus on something. If It helped a lot.”He also tried his hand at singing and playing the guitar. “When you can’t move around as you please, you do need things to occupy yourself.”
But as he started to get better, he also started gaining physical strength. He started to meet his fellow differently abled soldiers, who told him how it wasn’t the end of the world and that he could still participate in various sports. He adds that if he had not been sent to the Nepal Army rehabilitation centre in Bhandarkhal, he would have never overcome the mental hurdles required to become an athlete.
There he met Man Bahadur Lopsang, a member of the International Paralympic Committee, who gave Aryal and his fellow mates the added confidence which proved quite vital. “If he had not pushed us, we wouldn’t have been in this position.”
Aryal then started to train for weightlifting events. In 2010, he participated in power lifting events in China. That event proved vital because it not only gave Aryal exposure but also a belief that if they could win medals being disabled, so could he.
Coming back from China, he urged his ‘disabled’ colleagues to form a basketball team and started to train every morning. “We didn’t know where we were going with it. But, as we didn’t move much sitting on our wheelchairs, the sports played a key role to keep us fit.”
He became the captain of Nepal Army’s wheelchair basketball team. “Our team is quite strong. We’ve been winning for many years now and most members of the national team are from the Nepal Army.”
He is also the captain of the national team and has taken Nepal to Bangladesh for a tournament, during which they came second. Under his captaincy, his team has also beaten India, which he feels is a great achievement. “Beating India in any sport is great given the infrastructure they have as compared to us and I feel quite proud about it.”
Aryal adds that the desire to do well and prove themselves was the driving factor to train everyday even though they didn’t have a proper coach. “I’ve been working as a player and a coach for both the basketball and the cricket team.”
He shares that he pushes his team quite hard. He says he does that because he knows that his team cannot get complacent. “We won medals by working hard. If we want progress, we have to work hard. Else we will not win games.”
His team also won the International Wheelchair Basketball Tournament last year. He, however, complains that the government or stakeholders did not give much importance to it. “All medals and international recognition for the nation hold equal value whether they are brought by ‘abled’ individuals or ‘differently abled’.”
However, Aryal does feel that the disrespect he used to get from people around isn’t there anymore. “While going to the barrack in Chhauni, some little boys used to talk a lot of bad things, but now that they know who I am and treat me with respect. This sport has given me a lot. Even my parents aren’t as sad as they were before. People know me through this wheelchair.”
Aryal shares that if he wasn’t in the army, he wouldn’t have come so far. “They helped me both by taking care of me and my family, for which I’ll be forever grateful. They didn’t let me sit down and blame my destiny but asked me to fight my inner demons. If they hadn’t done that, I’d have remained confined to my wheelchair, feeling sorry about myself.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/himal-aryal-this-wheelchair-player-is-proving-a-dream-shattered-is-not-the-end-of-life.html,sports
Dheeraj Shrestha: Boy who once played football as hobby is leading A Division club at 19,"Monday, December 3, 2018","
When Dheeraj Shrestha got a call for a trail at Friends Club two years ago, he didn’t have much hope of becoming a footballer. With no support from his family and with hardly any experience at a tender age of 17, he never thought he’d make it.
But two years down the, line he’s the captain of one of Nepal’s A Division clubs.
Born in Okhaldhunga, Shrestha’s family moved to Kathmandu when he was two years old. His father was a labourer, who didn’t have a stable job and his mother was busy looking after him and his sisters.
“If I remember my childhood, it wasn’t great. We were always thinking about our next meal,” he shares.
Not wanting his son to have a similar life, Shrestha’s father admitted him to a school. “First I was admitted to a government school, but my father wanted me to do well, so he enrolled me at Don Bosco.”
At Don Bosco, Shrestha started to show interest in sports. “Although my first passion was dance, I liked to participate in 100 and 200 metre events.”
The passion for running then made a way for him being selected in the school football team. “I didn’t play football. But when I was in the ninth standard, our school participated in the Coca-Cola Cup. As the team needed players and I was a runner, my seniors asked me to play for the team.”
It was only after the tournament that he developed a love for the game. His performance in the interschool competition caught a few eyes and he was asked to join the ANFA Academy. “I wanted to go, but my father didn’t allow. He said there was no future and asked me to focus on my studies.”
He agreed to do so and focused on his studies passing his secondary level examinations with 76%. Then he tried to convince his parents, but they told him to focus on passing his high school first. “They also told me that I should start working and got me a job at Oppo’s mobile store.”
During high school, he found out about Messi and Ronaldo. “We didn’t have a television at our house. If we did, I’d have known about them and maybe would have played more football.”
To watch his two heroes, he used to go to his friend’s house and watch games. But when his parents found out, he was beaten up. “But still, I used to tell my mother that I’d make a name for myself in football.”
Even though his parents were against him, he kept on balancing football and studies together. He was adjudged the player of the tournament in a high school competition and was asked if he needed a coach to train him. “Even though I wanted to, I knew my parents wouldn’t agree so I passed on that opportunity.”
To make sure he didn’t hurt his parents’ feelings, he completed his high school and worked at the mobile shop for nine months. “I was doing well. I was getting a good response from my bosses, but I still wanted to play football.”
One day at work, he got training on how to be a good salesman. He was taught how to push ideas into people’s head and he used that technique at home to try and see if his parents would agree to make him a footballer. “It took me time, but my mother finally agreed. She said that if I wanted to get into football, I should.”

Things started to look better for him after that. “One day when I went home, my father approached me. What he said really shocked me. He asked me which boot I wanted to buy and took a shop and bought me football boots. It’s a day I will never forget.”
His father at one time had beaten him for going to training, but he now bought him a boot and that gave him a lot of confidence. “He didn’t believe me cent per cent, but his support was enough for me, which is why after that I started to train myself.”
While he was training on his own, a member from Friends saw him and offered him a trial. When Shrestha went for the trial, he was made a ball boy. “I didn’t know what to make of it. But I knew I had to start from the bottom if I were to reach the top.”
He got his break playing in the U18 Lalit Memorial Championship, in which his performances led the team to semifinals of the tournament.
That performance caught a few eyes and he was in the 30-man squad for the U-18 SAFF Championship held in Bhutan in 2017. “That was quite a moment. I’d always dreamed of playing for Nepal and that finally came true.”
Shrestha shares that winning that tournament by beating India was an unbelievable feeling. “We felt we’d climbed Mount Everest and come back. It was quite amazing.”
From the high of being SAFF Champions, he then faced a low after Nepal’s U18 team did quite poor in the AFC Qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan in the same year. “Maybe it was the weather or a maybe it was our minds, I don’t know what happened, but it was a poor tournament for all of us.”
After a poor showing in Kyrgyzstan, Shrestha came back and started his practice again for Chandragiri Gold Cup. “Everyone was telling me that I was doing well. But what happened before the tournament changed me.”
Just before the tournament, he was called to the office and made the club captain. “It was something I had never imagined. I was just 18 years old, never played in the first division yet I was made the club captain.”
He shares that his most memorable game was his first game as club captain. “I scored a hattrick in my first game. It couldn’t have been better.”
In a short span of two years, Shrestha rose from playing football as a hobby to signing his first professional contract aged 19. “I’ve never been a greedy player. I took whatever the club offered and am quite thankful to the Friends that I have been offered a contract and am leading this club in Division A.”
Even though his team have won just one game during the ongoing league, he still hopes they will have a good season. “I’ll do this for a few years. If I make it to the national team, I’ll have achieved my dream and if I don’t, maybe I’ll do something else in life.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dheeraj-shrestha-boy-who-once-played-football-as-hobby-is-leading-a-division-club-at-19.html,sports
ICC panel discussing steps to end Nepal cricket stalemate,"Friday, November 30, 2018","
Kathmandu, November 30
A meeting of the monitoring committee constituted by the International Cricket Council to find a solution to a dispute seen in the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) is taking place on December 8.
According to suspended CAN chair Chatur Bahadur Chand, ICC representatives, and representatives from the National Sports Council (NSC) and CAN will be participating in the meeting, which will also see formal discussions about the CAN’s district elections.
The first meeting held in mid-July in Kathmandu had agreed to study documents regarding district elections and give authenticity to the elections completing the due processes.
The same meeting had urged the bodies concerned to take back the case registered in the court and dissolve the CAN ad-hoc committees.
But the stand of the suspended CAN is that the case could not be pulled back from the court until a road map was created for the resolution of problems.
It may be noted that the October 27 meeting of the executive committee of suspended CAN had agreed in principle to take back the writ registered some two years ago, naming the NSC as defendant.

Hari Khadka on a mission to lead Nepali women footballers to glory,"Friday, November 23, 2018","
When ANFA asked Hari Khadka to take charge of the women’s football team, he wasn’t sure if it was the right job for him. But his love for football and the dream of becoming a coach lured him into getting a coaching license and to taking the job.
“The first training session as coach was quite surreal but then I soon realised the job at hand. I had to start from zero. I expected the players to know the basics. But that wasn’t the case which is why I had to teach them both attacking and defensive basics which would improve them,” shares Khadka.
Khadka feels he’s lucky that he inherited a good team because it had the hunger to do well and the discipline to train to be the best. “It was a boon for me. The players were honest and passionate. They gave in their 100 per cent in training which was a huge plus point for me.”
Unlike new managers, Khadka shares that he likes to do things the old-fashioned way.”I don’t watch youtube videos to train my players. I like to watch them on the field and train them accordingly. I look at situations and observe how my players reacted and then work on our strength and weakness,” he adds.
With that spirit, Khadka took the women’s team to the first qualifying round of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics where it was going to face hosts Myanmar, South Asian giants India and one of the most improved women’s team in Asia, Bangladesh.
“Before going to Myanmar, I took to team to China to play a few matches. Those three matches there gave me an idea about our strengths and weaknesses which was of great help in Myanmar.”
Khadka’s first official match was against India, a team that Nepal always lost to. “There was a fear among the girls. They wanted to beat them badly but having never done that beforethey were morally down,” he adds.
But Khadka used that to his advantage to build up their confidence. He didn’t want their heads to drop even before the ball was kicked which is why he installed a belief which would be key during the entire tournament.
Having always played India with a defensive game plan, Khadka decided that it was time to take the game to them. “I want to win playing good football and that is exactly what we did. We dominated the game and apart from the goal created three really good chances. But sadly one lapse in concentration meant we conceded a goal but I think that draw against South Asia’s best team gave the team a lot of confidence.”

Khadka then took the confidence from that game and drew against formidable opponents Myanmar scoring in the first few minutes. “I had observed that Myanmar started their games quite slowly which is why I told the team to press them from the start which gave us an early lead. But the gulf showed when they equalised.”
The final game was a must-win against Bangladesh and Nepal took the lead in that game as well but we were undone by a late equaliser. “The game was going as planned but luck didn’t favour us and we drew. But I knew a draw was enough as I knew we were the best third-place team which meant we qualified for the next round which is due to take place next year.”
Khadka now feels it is the time to move forward. Even though he is happy with the team, he wants more from them so can Nepal can win the upcoming SAFF Championship being held in Nepal early next year. “We are in a good position but have to work hard both on and off the field to make sure we do well in our home tournament.”
He also adds that competitions like the Chief of Army Staff Cup, taking place in Kathmandu will surely help bring in more players to the national team. “These tournaments are very important for the development of the game as it helps my players get better and helps me unearth new talents.”
He adds that he has also told the players that there are no guarantees for places and players will be selected on the basis of current performance and not past ones. “I’m not making club team. My job as the coach is to make sure all these players give their hundred per cent every time they play and I’m thankful to the Nepal Army who continues to give the girls a platform which will definitely help set up an environment for football. ”
Khadka humbly shares that he’s still learning. “I’ve only started my coaching career and want to go a long way. I’m still learning a lot. Every day I learn new things from players and other coaches which is good. I may have my weaknesses which people are free to talk about because only that way can I become a good coach and do well for Nepali football.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-khadka-in-a-bid-to-lead-nepali-women-to-glory.html,sports
Paras Khadka: Nepali cricket’s key ‘architect’ has a vision for future,"Thursday, November 15, 2018","
Growing up in Baneshwor, Paras Khadka never thought he would be a cricketer. Even though he played the sport from an early age, ‘architect’ was the identity that he embraced for his future, during his early life.
Even though he couldn’t become an architect, his contribution to the development of Nepali cricket is not less than that of an architect. And the national team’s captain for the past nine years, Khadka still wants to contribute more to the sector.
“I was good in studies and always felt that I would make a name for myself with the help of academics. If I look back, I feel I became a cricketer by accident,” shares Khadka.
Khadka’s cricket career took off when his school, South Point Boarding High School, participated in KB Khatri Memorial Cup. “The tournament was taking place at the TU Ground in Kirtipur, the place I had always dreamt of playing,” he adds.
Khadka then led his school to glory and was one of the standout players during the tournament. That put him in the eye of the selectors and was picked for Nepal’s U-15 team. He did not know that the national team selectors were also present at the match.
Khadka then carried on playing for other age groups and was also part of the team that won the U-19 Plate Championship in 2006. “That was an amazing tournament, not just because we won, but because we beat two test playing nations, South Africa and New Zealand.”
Winning that title gave Khadka confidence to do well in cricket. “I always doubted if cricket had a future in Nepal, which is why I always wanted to go to cricketing nations like Australia or England where I could study and play cricket simultaneously.”
When then coach Roy Dias told him he was in line to become the captain, Khadka told him that he wanted to go abroad to peruse his studies, but when his visa to Australia got rejected he decided to give cricket a go.
“If I look back, I’m thankful that my visa got rejected after which I thought why not carry on playing cricket,” adds the skipper.
He shares that things started to get serious when was made captain in 2009. “It was only after that I started thinking about a future in cricket. Things were getting serious which is why I then started to push myself. I knew I could get better and even though we were in Division 5, I knew we could go a long way.”
Khadka then led the team to the Division 5 title at home. “That tournament was a bit crazy. I remember people never thought that the senior team could win. Winning it gave both us and the fans a hope that we could win.”
That win at home gave the team confidence to do better. In that process, Khadka also led the national team in the 2014 T20 World Cup held in Bangladesh.
“That tournament was a memorable one. Qualifying for it was tough, but we had a lot of fun during the tournament. There was pressure because the world was watching but we took that as inspiration and gave our best; and beat Hong Kong and Afghanistan only losing to hosts Bangladesh.”
Four years after the historic tournament, Khadka led the team to another achievement – becoming an ODI nation. “This was everyone’s dream. Everyone worked hard to get here and it wasn’t easy. It was the effort of us, honest crickets.”
Khadka shares that credit for the national team’s success should also go to Pubudu Dassanayake. “Everyone says the 2014 T20 World Cup was a breakthrough moment in the Nepali cricket. But what we didn’t realise is that the growth of Nepali cricket started when Pubudu sir became our coach.”
He adds that Dassanayake’s role was vital, not only because he taught them how to play, he also taught them how to carry themselves as players. “Before he came, we just played because we had to. We had no future plan or how to promote ourselves. He taught us like we were his kids.”
Khadka also shares that Dassanayake also gave Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) a framework on how to take cricket forward an advice not taken by the board.
In 2014, Khadka, as captain, made a decision to revolt against CAN. “CAN didn’t want to work to develop cricket in Nepal. We made efforts to talk with them, but they didn’t listen. I as captain and Pubudu sir as coach offered our suggestions, but they were never taken into consideration.”
He shares that they kept on getting shut out by the members who had disputes among themselves. “We couldn’t even get all of them in the same room,” he shares.
“What we realised was that nothing had changed. The facilities in 2010 were the same as the facilities in 2000. The country only had one proper cricket ground and even that didn’t have electricity. We had to raise our voice to make a difference and I think that was the right decision.”
Khadka believes that doing that will now make sure that the new board, whenever it will be formed, will work for the benefit of cricket.
“We put our careers on the line for the good of cricket in Nepal. Our team unity was good and that helped us a lot in this time. How we did it might have been bad, but our intentions were clear and sometimes I feel we should have done it earlier.”
He feels that now when the board is established it should only have full-time members working for the betterment of the game. “You can’t work two hours a day and hope to change cricket in Nepal. It should be a full-time job which needs honest personnel working for the good of the game.”
With competitions like Dhangadhi Premier League, Everest Premier League and Pokhara Premier League, Nepal cricket is slowly getting momentum. “The private sector is doing what the government should be doing. They have capitalised on the cricketing environment and have given players a platform to showcase their talent and also changed their lifestyle.”
The domestic T20 leagues, according to Khadka, have helped bring more players. “Earlier we only had 18-20 players, but now we have around 30-35 players to choose from, which is good for Nepali cricket.”
He also feels that the players they have now are good, but need better coaching. “We’ve taught what we know and what we’ve learned which is why these young players need more. We need better pitches, better coaches and better facilities because these players have potential which can take Nepali cricket to greater heights.” It seems Khadka, who may retire after few months or years, also has a clear vision for future.
Khadkha also believes that upon retirement, he will be around cricket. “I owe everything I have to cricket, which is why I don’t think I can get away from it. I will surely be in the background, always working to make cricket better.”
But he adds that he can’t do it alone. “It’s a team effort. Like cricket, I can’t do it alone and will need a team.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/paras-khadka-nepali-crickets-key-architect-has-a-vision-for-future.html,sports

Cricket Australia’s culture sore: captains of the finance industry should take note,"Friday, October 26, 2018","
Being captain of the Australian cricket team has been described as the nation’s most aspired-to job after the role of Prime Minister. Being chief executive of Cricket Australia (CA) can’t be too far behind?
Last week the board of Cricket Australia announced insider Kevin Roberts will take the job, replacing James Sutherland after 17-years at the helm.
Despite a “global search”, Roberts was always considered the front-runner. Chairman David Peever had stated a preference for an internal CA candidate. Roberts, a former first-class NSW cricketer and sports apparel company executive, was a Cricket Australia board director between 2012 and 2015. Then he was Cricket Australia’s executive general manager for strategy, people and member services. Earlier this year he became Cricket Australia’s chief operating officer.
Given the evidence of an unhealthy culture at cricket’s top echelons, it might be argued that appointing an insider does not augur well for Cricket Australia in coming to terms with the problem. Roberts’ performance will affect the reputation of the game in Australia, and the lucrative business it now is. It is a lesson for corporate Australia, particularly those companies whose own cultural problems have been exposed by the banking royal commission.
The ball-tampering scandal, in which the Australian cricket team’s senior players allegedly conspired to cheat in a match against South Africa, exposed a “win-at-all-costs” culture.
Along with sanctions against individual players, Cricket Australia responded by establishing an inquiry into the “cultural, organisational and/or governance issues” affecting Australia’s professional cricket teams. The inquiry’s findings have now been presented to the CA Board. It will be Roberts’ responsibility to act on them and to deliver.
We will have to wait to find out if the review on “culture” has spanned the entire organisation. It will need to have addressed selection processes, values, leadership and all the financial arrangements involving players, sponsors, and broadcasters.
To move past the appalling shenanigans in South Africa, Cricket Australia needs to uphold the values of integrity, fairness and accountability. These are not just sporting principles. They should be important to all corporate cultures.
Roberts’ tenure begins in a period of unprecedented challenges for Australian cricket. The three major issues of the past year have been:
All three issues remind us that Cricket Australia, a company limited by guarantee, is a uniquely structured business – and a big one.
Based on financial statements over the past five years, it is awash with cash. CA averages surpluses in excess of A$100 million a year (before distributions to member state associations). At the end of the 2016/17 financial year CA had almost A$136 million in the bank.
Revenues from sponsors, media rights, spectators and other customers had grown by 60%, to A$338 million. Its new broadcast rights deal with Foxtel and the Seven Network is reported to be worth some A$1.2 billion over the next six years.
Cricket Australia is a financial conglomerate with a monopoly it can only dream about. We should not be be too surprised this has engendered “profit-maximising” misbehaviour.
Its shareholders – the state member associations, who benefit from the rivers of gold – have little accountability to other stakeholders. Cricket fans have no say, except as consumers of the “cricket product”.
Now Cricket Australia urgently needs to consider what its values are, and how they can be meaningfully reflected in the culture and general conduct of the players and officials.
How players are offered contracts, and the structure of contracts, needs review. The extent to which performance incentives have contributed to the “win at all costs” modus operandi, should be strongly investigated. There are clear parallels to what the banking royal commission has uncovered about the association between compensation practices and bad behaviour.
How the captain of the Australian team is selected also needs review. They should not be chosen because they are the best batsman and therefore the most marketable. They should be chosen for their ability to lead and show leadership, making the competitive and tactical decisions on the field and also adhering to all laws and acting at all times within the spirit of the game (i.e. culture).
Finally, the CA inquiry must, at long last, finally address sledging. Sledging in any form is a type of mental abuse. Mental abuse and bullying need to be called out for what they are: harmful to society and unacceptable to any workplace culture.
It is paramount that elite men’s cricket in Australia rediscovers its sense of fair play, professionalism, and becoming known once more as “the gentlemen’s game”.
In doing so, it might provide an example for business leaders to fix their own internal cultural problems.

Meet Nepal’s veteran sportsman who played ‘everything that he found’,"Thursday, October 4, 2018","
While playing on the roads in Dillibazar, Komal Pandey never thought he would be a big name in the country’s sports sector. But now, he is one of few Nepalis who have represented Nepal in not one, but three disciplines of sports.
Pandey, 77, grew up in what he calls the centre for sports in Kathmandu, Dillibazar. That is where he says he leaned it all. “The credit for me becoming a sportsman goes to Dillibazar,” says Pandey.
Pandey started playing sports from an early age. “As there were limited vehicles, we used to play on the road. The kids had to play on the pavement while the adults used to play on the road. The competition back in those days was quite surreal.”
During his early years, he started playing football with a bhogate (pomelo). “We couldn’t buy footballs back then. It was either the fruit or a ball made from paper, straw or cloth which we sometimes covered with the covering of old footballs. But that was quite heavy and was not easy to kick around.”
Noticing a young boy playing well in youth competitions for his school, the youth team of Mahabir Club signed him up. “I played a lot of games and at the age of 12, I joined Young Mahabir which was Dillibazar’s local team.”
Along with football, he also started playing cricket after watching some of his friends play a game at Sano Gaucharan. “I held my first bat when I was 13,” shares Pandey.  “During the first few months, the only thing I did was defend and that came in quite handy when the same year I had to open the batting for CAN XI in a league match. I remember being petrified and I only scored 8 runs in 108 minutes. Those runs flew off edges,” he adds.
As a child, Pandey also loved to watch athletics events happening in the Valley. “I was first attracted to athletics when I saw a few people participate in high jump events.”
He shares that he competed in any tournament he could find. “I used to play football during monsoon, cricket during autumn/winter and athletics during spring, which is why most of my friends used to call me “Khe-kha Pandey”(khelera khane) which translates to someone who makes a living playing sports.
Back in those days, there used to be a lot of competition. “From youth level to professional level, sports was an important part of life for many living in major cities,” adds Pandey. “That foundation helped us a lot. It wasn’t just me who got better as a player, everyone did.”
As he grew older, he started to get better at all the sports he played. Aged 19, he was made the captain of Mahabir which he says made him responsible. “Captains had to do everything; from finding players to taking the jerseys to the washer.”
As he was excelling in more than one sport, Nepal’s sports authority decided to send him to Israel on a sports scholarship to study Sports and Physical Education. “That was a great experience. I learned a lot and brought what I learned to Nepal as well.”
After a year in Israel, he joined Mahabir; but this time not as a captain but as a player. He says he started teaching his team the basics of how to get better and stay fit and that helped Mahabir win the 1966 league trophy. “That league was special to me. I scored a lot of goals as I remember I scored 5 hat-tricks in the season.”
He also won the league in 1969 which also marked the end of Mahabir’s dominance.
Coming back to Nepal, he joined Tri Chandra Campus and did his BA. “It was at Tri Chandra where I started to take cricket seriously. The campus had a lot of equipment, but hardly anyone played. So the coach asked me to use these and build a team and I slowly urged everyone to come together and play cricket.”He then went on to form his own club, Amateurs Cricket Club, which he captained to a league and knockout victories.
With that, he also started trying his hand at various athletic events. “I think I was around 19 when I ran my first race. It was a national level tournament and I was competing in a 200-metre event.”
Having never competed in such race, he says he got off to a good start. “I led the way till 150 metres, but then I lost balance and fell down and lost the race. But I knew that I would be better with time.”
In the 1967 national championship, Pandey participated in five sporting events – 100 and 200 metres, long jump and 4×100 and 4×400 relay events. “I won a gold medal in all 5 events, which I feel very proud of,” he shares.
Pandey first represented Nepal in the Agha Khan Gold Cup held in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). “That was a memorable competition for us. Although it was tough for us to compete with Pakistanis who were 6-foot tall, but we still managed to win one game, and all of us from that group cherished a lot.”
The second time Pandey represented Nepal in a sporting competition was during the 1966 Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO). “I remember I ran 100 and 200 metres. I didn’t win, but I got to carry Nepal’s flag in the opening ceremony, which still remains one of my proudest moments.”
He represented Nepal in another international event when he was the vice captain of the cricket team participating in a match against Royal Bangkok Sports Club in 1972. “We played two games against them. We were poor in the first game and lost, but won the second match.”
Pandey balanced all three games together with ease. He shares that he couldn’t stay ideal and had to play one sport or another. “Each sport helped me while playing another. My sprinting career helped me a lot during both cricket and football and football in general improved my overall fitness. The two team sports also helped me understand teamwork better.”
Pandey retired from two of the sports at a young age. “I was 26 when I quit sprinting. It was after the 1968 national championship when I decided to stop running. The controversial 100-metre event forced me to take the decision,” adds Pandey, who shares that they did not give him the gold even though he won the finals.
Then he quit football, aged 27. “Mahabir had run its course and started to go down. We hardly had 11 players. Adding to that, there were some issues between Dillibazar and Nepal’s sports association. Then, I thought it was time to quit the one sport which was very dear to me.”
As for cricket, he played it till he was in his late 30s. “After quitting both games I thought I had to play one to keep me occupied. My club Amateur Cricket Club did quite well in many tournaments and the team we had back then was quite good.”
Pandey says that he owes everything to sports. He shares that the love and fame he has received from the people is all thanks to sports. “I believe sports have a lot of power. It gives joy to people and also promotes nationalism. The government should definitely look after it in a better manner.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/meet-nepals-veteran-sportsman-who-played-everything-that-he-found.html,sports
Martyr’s Memorial A-Division: Defending champions gear up for tough season,"Friday, September 28, 2018","
Manag Marsyandi, the seven-time winners of Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League are preparing to defend their title. The players who have recently joined training are in a jubilant mood ahead of their opener against Brigade Boys Club next week.
In order to make sure they perform well in the league, they have hired Nigerian Tope Fuja, who previously managed Machhindra Club.
“It feels good to be back in Nepal,” adds Fuja. “I had a good time with Machhindra a few years ago and now I am looking forward to my new challenge.”
Fuja, who spent the last three years in India with Peerless Sports Club, is adamant that his boys put in extra effort in training. When attacker Anjan Bista loses the ball, he calls him and tells him to remain composed and not panic during tough situations.
“We need to be focused. To win the league we have to be the best and that is possible when we work hard in training,” shares the coach.
The mood within the team is upbeat. There is good chemistry between the team as everyone looks happy. Since the league is commencing after a gap of four years, everyone on the team is excited and wants to do well.

“Team chemistry is important that is what I’m trying to install in the team. If we play well as a team, I think we will surely be champions because we have the players” adds Fuja.
Biraj Maharjan, the captain of the club, is excited as well. After his poor showing in the recently concluded SAFF Championship, he wants to perform well in the league. “Everyone wants to be league champion, so do I and I feel we have a team that can compete with big teams like Army and Three Star,” adds the defender.
He along with other national team players like Anjan Bista, Bishal Rai and Sujal Shrestha add that the new coach has been a breath of fresh air. They say the coach gives the players a new perspective to the game.
“He’s got many years of coaching experience and I feel that his way of managing is quite modern and that is the main difference between a foreign coach and a Nepali one. They study modern football and coach us accordingly which also helps improve our,” adds Maharjan who is relieved that the league football is back in Nepal.
Fuja says he’s working on two things: fitness and passing. “The most important thing right now is getting these players back into shape. This is why I have been pushing them in training. Secondly, I want to play good football. We want to play possession-based because that way we’ll not be running needlessly and it will also help us break down opponents defence,” adds the coach.
The team also has a blend of good national and international players. One of them is Victor Amobi, who has been playing in Nepal, for the past six years and has won the league with Three Star Club. He says that the new coach has been good for the foreign players as well.
“Yes, we are all happy,” shares Amobi. “He’s made training fun for us. I think the team is well balanced too which makes us one of the favourites to win the league.”
Fuja mentions that this blend of foreign and Nepali players is what makes them a strong attacking force. “We have young players like Anjan Bista who give us speed and on the other hand, we have a player like Afeez Olawale who gives us stability and experience. And I feel that is important if we are to compete at the level,” adds Fuja.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/martyrs-memorial-a-division-defending-champions-gear-up-for-tough-season.html,sports
"Dream and disillusionment: At the end of career, Nepal’s record runner feels betrayed by his passion","Friday, September 21, 2018","
Yam Sajan Sunar, 25, cannot sleep at night because he keeps thinking about what he could have been if not a runner. Back from competing in the 100 metre event at South Asian Games in Indonesia, Sunar feels that things could have gone a lot better. But now, with the time running out from his sprinting career, he feels that deciding to run was the biggest mistake of his life.
Born in Kudu, a small village in remote Jajarkot district, Sunar was a curios boy who ran around looking for adventures. At a tender age of six, the national sprinter broke his leg when he fell down from a tree while climbing.
“I can still remember how painful it was. It was pretty tough for my family as well because I had to be flown to Nepalgunj to get it checked where the doctors advised to place a rod in the leg,” he says. “When my father heard that, he was very scared as he had heard that if not done properly it could cause cancer. So he took me to Lucknow for the surgery, which went well and within few months I was back in Kudu,” he adds.
Before getting injured, he used to participate in long jump and triple jump events with children from his age group and beat them easily. But after coming back, they beat him comprehensively in many events. “Being beaten in something I was good at made me really sad. I cried a lot, but my father consoled me that I had to be patient until the injury healed and I’d be back to my best in no time.”
When Sunar was in the seventh standard and his injuries had completely healed, he competed in a long jump tournament in a village fair. “I was extremely determined and managed to beat everyone by a metre, which was quite unexpected given I was in my early teens,” shares the sprinter.
After that win, he became a household name in the village where people often praised him by saying ‘Yam Sajan ta hawa jastai udchha’ (Yam Sajan can fly like the wind).
The 14-year-old boy then started to dream. However, for his dream to come true, he had to leave his village and explore the opportunities. “A friend of mine who studied at Deep Jyoti Boarding School in Nepalgunj had told his principal about how having me in the school would help them win medals in sports events. The principal then asked me to join his school, so I left Jajarkot for Nepalgunj,” he remembers.
Leaving his village was not easy for him. He was in a new place, away from his family, but that did not deter him and he soon became one of the best athletes of the school and went on to represent his school in a national level tournament in Kathmandu, where he stood first in the long jump event.
“A lot of people noticed me then. Everyone was shocked that a 14-year-old boy from a small village in Jajarkot had just won a gold medal,” he shares. That was when he saw a future where he could someday represent his country at the international level.
Till the age of 14, Sunar had never participated in any running competition, but in the fifth National Games he decided to try competing in the 200m event. “Till then I thought long jump was a sport which I could excel in, but when I came fifth in the 200m event, I knew that I would do well in sprinting too,” he shares.
So after a year, with full support from his family, Sunar felt that he could really achieve something in sports. “My parents were very proud that their son’s name was in the newspapers. Seeing them proud and having their support made me really happy back then,” he shares.
After completing his final secondary examinations from Nepalgunj, he went to Singapore to compete in the Junior Games in 2009. Then, he came back and continued his studies at Xavier International College because he felt that education was also equally important.
Having competed in the 200 metre event, Sunar in the sixth National Games in Dhangadhi decided to try his hand at 100 metre. In a controversial final, Sunar finished second to Olympian Tilak Ram Tharu. “It was quite an interesting race which gave me a hope that I could compete in this event too,” he says.

After that, Nepal Engineering College offered him a scholarship, but since his focus was in sprinting and he wanted to make a career in it, he refused the offer. “If I could go back, I would have taken that scholarship and become an engineer. But at that time, my whole focus was on running and being the best sprinter in Nepal,” adds Sunar.
However, he did get enrolled at Tri Chandra Campus for the BSc Physics programme.
His hard work did pay off when he set a national record of 10.40 seconds in the 100 metre race at the National Championship held in Lumbini. “My aim, which was to set a national record some day, came true and I was very happy that day,” he says.”Everyone was happy. My parents were very proud of me but they kept on asking how being in sports would help me earn money,” he adds.
Most of his life he had been asking money from his parents, but after that he decided to start earning. He ran for Armed Police Force and Nepali Army, which initially supported him.
According to Sunar, he was at his best just before the South Asian Games in South Korea in 2014. He says, “I was at my peak. During the qualifying, I beat Tharu too, leaving him three metres behind me and broke my own record when I clocked in at 10.30 seconds.” But after injuring his ankle just before the tournament, he could not perform well. “That was the time I started to think that training alone wasn’t the key to success. Sometimes luck plays an important role too,” he shares.
In fact, Sunar had already begun considering himself unlucky quite earlier. There were a number of reasons behind it. He adds that for any sportsperson to succeed, the associations play an important role. But, the case in Nepal is different.
“How can we compete with the best in Asia when we don’t get half the facilities the others have?” he shares. “For a runner to succeed in the biggest stage, he needs proper diet, proper training facilities and proper monitoring, all of which are absent here. How can we run fast when all we were eating was dal bhat and uncooked chickpeas?” says the frustrated sprinter.
Even though he was doing well at the national level, his wish to excel in the international stage had still not been fulfilled as his performance in the 2016 South Asian Games in India did not go as planned as the ankle troubled him there too.
However, he won gold medals in both 100 and 200 metre events in the seventh National Games. “I don’t know how, but I still managed to win the two events in such a poor track; but for me it was good preparation for the 2018 Asian Games.”
After a training camp in Kolkata where the ankle still troubled him, he left for Indonesia to compete in the 100 and 200 metre events. “This time it wasn’t just the ankle, that was troubling me. I don’t think I was in the right frame of mind which is why my 100 metre didn’t go well and I had to pull out from the 200 metre event.”
He says for an athlete to do well, everything has to go right. “If a runner doesn’t have security about his future, how will he run well?” questions Sunar. “Having run for nearly a decade, I now feel that Nepal doesn’t have an environment for athletes to succeed. Until the government prioritises sports and implement it promises, there will always be athletes who leave the country for better opportunities.”

Sunar feels that if he had better coaching and a secure future, he would have done well. “In the past few years all I’ve thought about is my future. I’m a grown man now and asking money from parents is quite embarrassing.”
Now, the boy who used to fly feels his wings have been chopped. “My wish to win a medal always eluded me. I always believed that sports is connected to nationalism and I wanted to give the people of Nepal something to cheer about, but I couldn’t and that will always make me sad,” he adds.
He also adds that kids shouldn’t make sports their priority. “My message to kids out there is simple. Focus on studies and only get into sports if your family can support you. By playing sports, you will never be able to support you family well.”
While going from Jajarkot to Nepalgunj, he felt he could conquer the world, but now he realises that his race is coming to an end. “One half of my heart wants to quit, but the other half wants to continue running. This dilemma is what’s troubling me right now,” says the sprinter, adding the upcoming South Asian Games might be the last time the fans see him on the track.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/yam-sajan-sunar-nepal-record-runner.html,sports
Nepal lose SAFF semifinal to Maldives,"Wednesday, September 12, 2018","Kathmandu, September 12
Nepal’s dream of winning the SAFF Championship title for the first time got shattered on Wednesday as they got defeated by the Maldives 3-0 in the first semifinal of the tournament being held in Dhaka of Bangladesh.
Captain Akram Abdul Ghanee scored in the ninth minute of the match to take the lead. The lead was tripled in the second half as Ibrahim Waheed Hassan scored two goals in the 84th and the 86th minutes.
Nepal made some impressive moves during both the halves, but could not translate them into goals. They also were better than the opponents in terms of ball possession and pass accuracy.
The match was halted after the 28th minute for around 20 minutes due to a thunderstorm.

Bal Gopal Maharjan: We want to gift happiness to all Nepalis with SAFF victory,"Wednesday, September 12, 2018","Dhaka, September 12
Nepal national football team are playing against the Maldives in the first semifinal of the SAFF Championship in Dhaka of Bangladesh on Wednesday afternoon. They want to reach the final stage of the regional tournament for the first time in 25 years.
The victory over the Maldives, however, is not easy. Whereas Nepal have never defeated them in any match of the SAFF Championship, they have made an impressive 4-1 win over the Maldives in the semifinal of Bangabandhu Gold Cup in Bangladeshi in 2016. Nepal want to repeat the history today.
In this context, Onlinekhabar’s Saroj Tamang has talked to Nepali team’s coach Bal Gopal Maharjan about his strategies for the team.
Excerpts:
What grounds do you have to make a win over the Maldives?
We played three games in the group stage, and we played all the games quite well. We have been improving our performance everyday. All players have given their 100 per cent dedication to the team. I will continue the same instructions and strategies today as well.
The semifinal game against the Maldives is quite different from the Bangabandhu Gold Cup and 12th SAG football. But this time, we have targeted defeating the Maldives for the third time in a row in the semifinal stage to reach the final.
I am confident that my players will be able to break the defence line of the Maldivian team. We will play an attacking game today.
So are you confident of making the win on the basis of offensive play?
We will change our strategy according to the situation. It may be offensive or defensive. In the match against Bangladesh, I had three alternative strategies in my hand. I will do the same today  as well.
But, don’t you think your players are under pressure as Nepal have never defeated the Maldives in the SAFF?
Let’s not talk about our performance eight or 10 years ago. Remember how we defeated them two years ago (during the semifinal of Bangabandhu Gold Cup). I and my players will invest their energy to defeat the Maldives so that we can gift happiness to all Nepalis. I am committed to making an unprecedented result from the game today.
This game will be historical for Nepal.
What is your message to fans of the team?
I want to express my gratitude to my team’s supporters as well as media. Special thanks to those who have come to the stadium in Dhaka to encourage the team. I have expected the same support from upcoming days as well.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bal-gopal-maharjan-we-want-to-gift-happiness-to-all-nepalis-with-saff-victory.html,sports
Can Usain Bolt really make it as a footballer?,"Wednesday, September 5, 2018","What to do when you’ve won it all?
After the 2017 World Championships and a truly stellar career, Usain St Leo Bolt bowed out of the sport he dominated for so long. Fame, fortune, and a personality to match, it’s hard to imagine Bolt was short of offers on hanging up his golden-laced spikes.
So, what do retired Olympic sprinters do: coach, commentate, agency work, celebrity TV appearances, or just rest on their laurels? Bolt had different ideas, openly expressing his desire to play professional soccer: “Maybe a club will see something and decide to give me a chance”, he said.
As an avid Manchester United fan, his most recent public appearance came as he captained the Rest of the World in the 2018 Soccer Aid at Old Trafford. Prior to this, he trained with South African outfit Mamelodi Sundowns FC, Norway’s Stromsgodset, and even German giants Borussia Dortmund.
In recent weeks, Bolt has earned an “indefinite training period” with Australian side Central Coast Mariners, and on August 31 he made his debut as a “trialist” in a pre-season friendly against amateur side Central Coast Football.
Notwithstanding Bolt’s profile, such sporting career transitions raise a series of questions for scientists like me with an interest in expertise research, and elite performance. How do individuals achieve such expertise? Is it possible to transfer between sports? And are some sports easier to transfer to than others?
Expertise can be defined as the ability of a person to consistently demonstrate superior levels of proficiency within a particular domain over an extended period of time. This is highlighted perfectly by Bolt, who won gold in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay at three successive Olympics.
Historically, theorists studying expertise have fallen into two schools of thought that parallel the “nature versus nurture” debate. Some, such as the 19th-century scientist Francis Galton, argued that eminence in science, music, art, and other fields reflects an innate or natural ability.
But practice is uniformly regarded as the single variable that has the greatest influence on skill acquisition. And this leads to the alternative viewpoint that it takes a minimum of 10,000 hours or ten years of “deliberate practice” to achieve domain-specific expertise.
Typically, researchers, today are of the view that while the sheer amount of practice is important, other factors, such as genetics, ability, and motivation are also likely to be critical. To this end, though Bolt may be blessed with certain hereditary capabilities such as height and a greater proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers, he has also invested the necessary training hours in order to reach the top of his sport.
So how easy is it to become a footballer? Soccer expertise is multi-faceted in nature, compromising of physiological, emotional, technical, and cognitive factors. By looking at how much footballers have practiced in the past, sports scientists have attempted to shed light on how they developed those skills.
In their study of elite English soccer players, one group of researchers concluded that early specialisation is an important precursor to expertise. Specifically, players would engage in the deliberate practice of their primary sport – in this case, football – from a young age (around five years). These activities are highly structured and often coach-led, with the specific purpose of improving performance.
The early engagement pathway is an alternative approach, which involves meaningful amounts of unstructured soccer-playing during childhood (six to 12 years of age), rather than coach-led practice and competition (“deliberate practice”).
Anecdotal evidence exists of Bolt playing street cricket and soccer when growing up, which seems to fit more with the early engagement pathway. That said, without a detailed account of his practice history, it is impossible to know how his sporting childhood may have shaped his soccer potential.
In light of his athletic commitments, it is difficult to see how Bolt has accumulated the required practice hours, in either soccer play or deliberate practice, to successfully transition to the professional game.
This brings us onto the question as to whether the skills developed from his years of experience in sprinting, could transfer to soccer. We know that successful career transitions are possible and one example is the former track cyclist Victoria Pendleton: after retiring from the velodrome at age 31 with Olympic and world titles, she made her competitive debut in horse racing three years later.
How successful the transfer can depend on the level of identical or similar elements that exist between the two performance domains. Sports scientists have classified these elements into four categories:
With the exception of certain aspects of physical conditioning such as reaction speed, and perhaps movements such as acceleration, it is evident that track sprinting and soccer share very little in common.
In contrast, it could be argued that many more similarities exist between sprint cycling and horse racing (pacing strategies, for instance), hence Pendelton’s successful transition.
Although only a very brief overview of expertise and the issue of transfer, the odds are stacked against Bolt, not least because he is 32 and soccer players typically reach their peak a few years earlier.
That said, the transfer from one sport to another is a complex process and all sorts of physical, social or functional variables can influence the rate and degree of transfer.
Be it fate, genetics, or sheer persistence, sometimes, everything just works out. A prime example comes from this year’s Tour de France. While most racers had devoted their lives to cycling – overall winner Geraint Thomas began aged ten – fourth place Primož Roglič was a former junior world ski jumping champion. His achievement was even more astonishing given he only took up cycling in 2012, already in his 20s.

SAFF 2018: Bal Gopal Maharjan and his boys looking to win big for Nepal,"Tuesday, September 4, 2018","
Bal Gopal Maharjan, the interim coach of Nepal’s national football team paces back and forth as his team trains for the upcoming SAFF Championship. Maharjan marshalls the members of the squad, whom he fondly calls as ‘my own boys’, from inside the field.
He shouts at the midfielder to take the ball forward and cautions the defenders to hold their line.
Maharjan has been involved with the development of the national team since 2012 when ANFA asked him to take charge of Nepal’s youth level. “When ANFA called me to look after the under-14s, in 2012 I took the chance as I got to develop a new batch of talent,” says Maharjan. Little did he know that he would be counting on the same batch of players to make Nepal proud in the SAFF Championship, set to kick off in Bangladesh on Tuesday.
The U-14s were selected through a rigorous process by ANFA officials who visited 45 districts and selected players such as Bimal Garti Magar, Anjan Bista, Anata Tamang and Hemanta Thapa Magar–names that have become symbols of youthful talent in the national squad. “It was important for Nepali football to have done that because it gave the national team four good players,” he shares.
Maharjan mentions that the development of a footballer should start from an early age. Initially, these players who played football for fun needed to be educated which is always a tough task. “A good football team isn’t made overnight, it takes time and effort of everyone involved and that is exactly what I think we did with the U-14 team.”
ANFA and Maharjan started to groom these players for the future age groups. “We had a plan then to play these players at U-16, U-20 and if they were good even the national team.”
The U-14 players got a chance to go to Japan and this gave them added exposure and a chance to learn from one of Asia’s best football teams. Maharjan then took the U-16 team to Korea. “We had a good time in Korea. We learned a lot from our experience there. Our team which consisted of Shiva Subedi, Akash Thapa and Anil Gurung was quite special. Don’t think I’ve seen a youth team as good as that in Nepal.”
After taking the team to South Korea and Belgium, he took over the U-19 team. The results were immediately visible, his side won the 2015 U-19 SAFF Championship, that too by defeating India. “These were the same players that had come through from the U-14s. The exposure they received by playing away from home was vital to our success.”
Winning the U-19 SAFF Championship gave him the opportunity to manage the national team as well. “I was ecstatic when I got the chance to manage the national team. But what was even special was winning the Bangabandhu Cup in 2016 with some of my boys who I had coached since 2012.”
Following a hiatus of two years, Maharjan was back as an assistant to Koji Goyotoku and soon landed on the hot seat after Goyotoku was barred from entering the country by the Department of Immigration after he was found to have been in the country without a valid visa.
After a poor performance at the 2018 Asian Games, Maharjan has his eyes set on the 2018 SAFF Championships. In his team are six of his boys from 2012 who are looking to shine on the big stage. “The boys have matured a lot and as they have won something in the earlier age groups they believe that it’s their time to shine,” he adds.
Every manager and coach has their own way of doing things. An experienced Maharjhan is no exception. His young boys look up to him along with other senior players who seem to have opened up to his philosophy.
But competing against nations like India and Bangladesh who have a strong league as compared to Nepal is going to be tough. That said, it hasn’t deterred Maharjan, who is hopeful the team will win the SAFF championship.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/saff-2018-bal-gopal-maharjan-and-his-boys-looking-to-win-big-for-nepal.html,sports
Esports in Nepal: An infant in need of nourishment,"Tuesday, August 21, 2018","The past two decades have seen a massive rise in the popularity of esports around the world. Even here in Nepal, young boys frequent cyber cafes to play popular games such as Counter Strike: GO (CS: GO), Dota 2 and League of Legends to practice for esports tournaments.
With prize money running into the millions, esports has become a global phenomenon with major brands investing heavily and corporations building stadiums larger than conventional ones.
Twenty-eight-year-old Arun Mishra (aka Air Wave), is one of them. He was introduced to Counter Strike 1.6, a popular esports game, by a friend 16 years ago. Since then, he has spent countless hours playing it.
“For me, it has become a part of life,” adds Mishra. “If I don’t play for a day, I don’t feel good,” says Mishra who plays the game 3-4 hours every day after he finishes his day job. Similar is the case with Abhiyan Gautam (aka Dealer). The 18-year-old recently won the CS: GO tournament (hosted by Nepal Esports Association) along with Mishra and his team Desperados in Kathmandu.
“It was due to hard work,” says the duo. “We did not win out of luck.”
What is Esport?
Esports – short for electronic sports is a contest between talented gamers as they strive to defeat their opponents on a range of digital battlefields.
It has its own rules, objectives, players, and requisite skill set. Esports mimics traditional sports in most aspects, using similar tournament formats, player contracts, and regulations.
Esports in Nepal
Esports in Nepal began with the rise in the cyber cafe culture. As homes didn’t have internet, playing online with other players was something gamers only dreamed of. At cyber cafes, youngsters could play games like Counter Strike, Dota and Warcraft with friends.
“As video game arcades started to close down, many young boys (age group 11-25) started to come to our cyber cafe to play games,” adds Deepesh Tuladhar who owns a gaming station called Power Play in Bhotahiti.
“The kids who didn’t have a computer at home still wanted to play. The reason we created this place over a decade ago was to have a place where gamers can come and play with friends or with the people within the game station,” he says adding, “Kids as young as 11 come play here and many older boys even spend the entire night playing Counter Strike or Dota against one another.”
As the internet started to get better, players started to play from the confines of their own houses. What was only limited to cyber cafes, soon evolved as the internet made it easier for them to play in the comfort of their room.
Nepal Esports Association
After noticing that esports was on the rise in Nepal, Suraj Dangol, who has a background in IT, decided to establish Nepal Esports Association (NESA) in 2012.
“I had no plan of forming NESA. My first plan was to launch a server for the gaming community here in Nepal,” says Dangol who studied in South Korea, a place where esports started. But after talking to Jeevan Ram Shrestha, President of the Nepal Olympic Committee, who told Dangol about how esports was going be a part of the Asian Games and the Olympics in the near future, he decided to start NESA.
“Jeevan dai told me a lot about how there were plans to develop esports globally. We wanted to do the same here in Nepal,” adds Dangol who wanted to lay a platform for amateur gamers to turn professional. “It took us four years to start NESA as we had to take permission from various international bodies,” he adds.
After four years of hard work, Dangol finally established NESA with a plan to take esports to the next level.

Since 2016, NESA is helping gamers such as Mishra and Poudel by hosting many small-scale tournaments and acting as a governing body. But its biggest achievement so far has been taking a Nepali team to the Asian Games South Asian Qualifier in Vietnam earlier this year.
“That was a great tournament for us. We learned a lot of things about how to take esports forward in Nepal,” adds Dangol. “We didn’t win, but it was a great learning experience for our gamers who will definitely do better when they get another chance,” adds Dangol.
NESA also hosted their first national level tournament which saw 16 teams compete against each other on Dota 2 and Counter Strike: GO.
Challenges in Nepal
In a country where even traditional sports haven’t flourished, there are many who are sceptical that esports will fare better. One of the main challenges, Dangol shares, is to raise awareness. “We need to tell people about this form of sport and how it can bring glory to Nepal,” he shares.
“And that starts with parents who need to know about how good a future the sport can bring,” adds Dangol. “As esports is in an infant phase, a lot of work needs to be done to explain to the parents who are unaware about the career.”
“It will definitely change once we register our first win in an international tournament,” he adds.
That is exactly what the players also feel. Many have given up because they stopped seeing a future in this sport. One of them is Prateek Pradhan (aka Bestoo) who is now an executive at NESA. “After years of playing, and having had no support from parents I decided it was time to stop. I still play, but not as much as I used to,” adds Pradhan.
He shares that he now works with NESA to help them develop the sport he loves and adores. “I couldn’t play it for long but now I want to make sure that our future generations will get to play this game freely. With NESA, I want to create a platform for young gamers which will help them compete with the best in Asia,” adds Pradhan.
Another problem is the lack of sponsorship in these events. “This year, we were very lucky as NCELL agreed to sponsor the event,” adds Dangol. But this type of sponsorship isn’t available every time and this makes it difficult to host such events on a larger scale. Normally tournaments have a maximum cash prize of Rs. 30,000, but thanks to NCELL this year’s prize was Rs. 150,000 for both Dota 2 and Counter Strike: GO.
“We also need a proper structure which can help us conduct these tournaments every year,” adds Dangol who hopes to hold tournaments in every province in the near future.

Scope
After the successful tournament this year, there is a lot of hope among the esports community in Kathmandu. NESA and the gamers both feel that they can do something to put Nepal’s name on the map of esports.
“NESA has been doing a good job to promote esports,” adds Jeevan Ram Shrestha President of Nepal Olympic Council who personally feels Nepal could do well in esports tournaments.  “If we slowly develop this, we can achieve a lot. There is a high chance of us bringing a medal in esports rather than other traditional sports,” he adds.
The players feel the same. Both CS: GO and Dota 2 winners have high hopes after this tournament.
“This was the first time we have taken part in a tournament which was almost international standard. The prize money was quite good too which will definitely bring in more participants next time they host such a tournament but when it comes to winning medals a lot needs to be done,” adds Ashok Adhikari (aka Killa) who’s been playing Dota of the past nine years.
“We have got the players,” he adds “But we need to make sure we have enough resources which help us reach the top,” he shares. “What is needed is for sponsors to come and support us because only they can help us reach the level where we aspire to be,” adds Adhikari.
While they are hopeful, they are also realistic. Dangol shares that while he believes that Nepal could compete and do well within South Asia, it could take up to a decade to compete with East Asia and the United States where esports has been flourishing.
Competing internationally
After almost two decades, esports finally featured at the 2018 Asian Games as a demonstration sport. This has brought a lot of hope to the players. “We want to get better and play in tournaments like these,” adds eighteen-year-old Gautam.

NESA and Pradhan are hopeful that Nepal will be included in future tournaments around the world. “We will be sending a detailed report of the tournament to the esports federation after which they will assess and determine if we are eligible to participate in these tournaments. We have booked slots but we’ll have to wait to see if we will be selected,” adds Pradhan who is hopeful that NESA can help these gamers reach their full potential.

Paras Khadka: We don’t want to miss opportunity to play against India and Pakistan,"Tuesday, August 14, 2018","Nepal’s national cricket team skipper Paras Khadka was recently in Pokhara to observe ongoing preparations for Pokhara Premier League, scheduled for October-November this year. He was in rush as the Nepali team are currently training for the Asia Cup Qualifier.
Having just returned from the two-match one day international series against the Netherlands, Khadka was hopeful about results of the Qualifier that will begin on August 29 in Malaysia. He said his team wanted perform the best in the tournament so that it would be qualified to play against test nations like India and Pakistan.
As Khadka was returning to Kathmandu after wrapping up his Pokhara stay, Onlinekhabar‘s Amrti Subedi has talked to the captain of Nepal national team about Nepali cricket’s future.
Excerpts:
How are you preparing for the Asia Cup Qualifier beginning in Malaysia after two weeks?
This is a golden opportunity for us. If we win the Qualifier, we will get opportunities to play against countries like India and Pakistan. It is also a good platform for our country. Therefore, we do not want to miss it. What players can do for that is regular practice. We will do out best to excel our performance.
You must win the Qualifier to play the Asia Cup. How do you evaluate your opponents like the UAE?
They are the teams that we defeated in Division Two or Division Three. Oman are a good team, but they lost to us in Division Two. We have been playing against the UAE regularly.
Overall, all teams are good. They will also come with a vision and energy like ours. They also have dreams to play the Asia Cup. It will not be an easy game for us. But, we will play the best possible.
Despite challenges galore in the management aspect, Nepal got the ODI status. They also won one of the two matches against the Netherlands in the debut series. Having returned from Amsterdam, how do you find people’s perception of Nepali cricket?
Nepali cricket reached this point without any (substantial) investment. If we invest in the sport, can you imagine where we arrive at? Yes, investments should be made for players and coaches, and physical infrastructures. A proper environment should be created to motivate people of the new generation to play cricket.
We have been trying hard to win more games, to elevate ourselves smoothly. We remained satisfied with the facilities provided to us because we loved cricket. We continued dreaming. Our dreams have made us stand up at this point today. If we had thought he had nothing, we would have reached nowhere.
Yes, cricket was not a priority (for the government) then. When we played the T-20 World Cup in 2014, people began looking at cricket differently. I think we should be excited about this changed perception.
Now, the context has turned more positive. We have got the one day status. I am more excited than ever.
How do you see upcoming days of Nepali cricket?
I am a player and I feel encouraged and happy about what I have. We have more challenges and responsibilities. Players who played before me also had a dream to get the ODI status. But, we achieved it only after rigorous efforts and hard work. It has opened a new path for Nepali cricket. But, many things depend on how we manage and move ahead with it.
Let me reflect on our past. We have passed through many ups and downs. Overall, the level of players’ performance continued going up, but the management could not be good. This is a sad aspect of our cricket. If there was proper management, we would have several stadiums today and each stadium would be hosting several tournaments. We would have other infrastructures too.
But today, we only have one ground at the Tribhuvan University. We cannot play at the Pulchock ground anymore.
I think we should think about what we can do tomorrow instead of what we did yesterday. We have new opportunities. There is an independent committee to resolve issues regarding the Cricket Association. We are hopeful that there will be a well-managed cricket board soon.

African footballers in Nepal: What they give to and get from a faraway land,"Monday, August 6, 2018","In 2012, Victor Amobi, 28, came to Nepal from Nigeria with 20 friends to see if they could play football in the Himalayan country. All of them had come to Nepal via an agent in Africa who had told them about the quality of football played here in Nepal.
Six years down the line, Amobi is currently playing for the Manang Marshyangdi Club in Kathmandu.
Amobi and his group were not the first foreigners to come play football in Nepal. The sudden rise of African football players started in 2005 after Boys Union Club acquired a football player from Africa.
After Nepali clubs saw how physically capable the Africans were, many of them started to acquire foreign players which gave them the edge against Nepalis–which is why by 2009, most teams had at least one African player.
However, for members of the general public, who see many Africans not only playing on the screen, but also walking on the streets around them, their presence is a little mystery. After all, why these youth come so far away to a ‘poor’ country like Nepal, just to play?
How they come
Most players come to Nepal through agents who have contact with clubs here. Same was the case with Victor when he came here. “Our agent in Nigeria helped us fix a friendly match with Jawalakhel Youth Club,” says Amobi.
Since Nepali clubs were looking for African players, many coaches came to see the match. “I remember I was told that Three Star Club’s manager Anjan KC was there and after a good performance I was picked to play for Three Star Club,” adds Amobi.
But not all come that way as was reviled by a recent article on The Guardian on how players in Africa are duped to come to Nepal and play. Amobi says those who come that way are desperate to leave the country. “Most people I know come here for football and football alone and that one article ca not generalise all Africans in Nepal,” he adds.
But a member of a football club who has been involved in Nepali football for two decades says many come here knowing that there is no league football, and those are the ones who create problems here. “Some aren’t here for football, they are here just to escape their countries,” adds an agent who does not want to be named.
Florent Larva Kone, 22, came in 2015 from Ivory Coast just after the season had ended. He did not come here through agents. After months of research and after talking to his friends who have been here, he decided to come. But it wasn’t as easy for him like it was for Amobi because since his arrival the national league stopped happening.
He too had to go through a trial, which is watched by many football clubs. If they are good enough, the clubs hire them and offer them a work permit which helps them stay in the country legally.
An agent also shares that after struggling to make it in India, many Africans cross the border and come to Nepal in search of regular football.
Why they come
“The players come here for one simple reason: to play football and get better,” adds Sugan Tandukar, a football agent in Nepal. And they have been doing so since the early 2000s. Most African countries are in turmoil and that is why most players in search of regular football leave.
“Like most Nepalis, even these Africans try to go to Europe; but the living expense there is too high and the opportunity there is limited and that is why they come to Asia,” continues Tandukar who says he became a football agent by accident while he was acting as a translator for an African player.
Kone came here because he could not go to Europe now and felt the type of football they play here would improve his game. But as he did not get to play league football here, he left for India. “I played I-League for a year, but the quality of football there made wonder if I would ever go to Europe playing like that,” he adds.
Amobi says something similar. He too feels that the level and the quality of football in Nepal is better than that in India. “There is more money in India, no doubt; but the level is quite bad. Here the football is quite tactical, which helps you take your game to Europe,” adds Amobi who played a year with Minerva Punjab FC.
Their challenges
One of the main challenges that Kone faces in Nepal is communications. “It was tough in the beginning but having friends here helped,” he says. “The game play is very different to what we are used to in Africa. There we play more physical and use the body more, here the guys are very fast and they play with their heads which for someone who’s not played in such an environment can be a bit tricky too,” he continues.
But for Amobi, the style of play was not an issue. “I play football with my mind; and yes it was a bit tough at the start, but I was at a good club which made me feel welcome,” he says.
But the major challenge these players have faced is the lack of league football. “We have come here to play and we aren’t getting to play as much,” adds Kone who had to go to India for regular football.
There are local tournaments in every city, but it is not the same as playing in the league, add both the players. “The tournaments are all over Nepal; and for us, it’s not easy travelling. Sometimes the clubs take us, but most of the times we have to go there alone,” adds Kone who feels the league football would mean they would play all games in the same city while they train for the rest of the days.

Opportunities and future
Like players abroad, the Africans have come here to learn and get better. “Footballers leave their countries to get better, that has been the case for years as it can been seen in Europe’s big leagues where a lot of people come from all over the world and it’s the same here,” adds Nabin Chitrakar, former Vice President of Machhinrda FC.
He continues, “For example, Zikahi Leonce Dodoz. When he initially came, he was not very good as he was played as a defender, but gradually coaches used him differently and he’s left Nepal as one of the best strikers and now is playing in I-League in India.”
It was Dodoz who made Kone come to Nepal and he hopes he too can follow in the footsteps of his friend. “He told me you can learn a lot here and I’ve realised that,” adds Kone. He continues, “I had lost my touch playing in India where they asked me to play a lot of long balls to runners; but here the coaches taught me to play with the midfield and take the ball forward.”
And, the coaches are quite helpful, adds Amobi, “They not only tell us what to do, they also try to learn a lot from us because they respect the fact that we have come from a foreign land and want to learn from our experiences.”
Like the coaches, local players learn from them too. “Previously, Nepali players were scared to play against Africans; but as they got accustomed to them and learned how to deal with the big players, they stared to get better and now they aren’t afraid of playing against them,” adds Tandukar, who feels Nepali players would get better if they went and played abroad.
With league football starting again after a hiatus of three years, there is a joyous mood around everyone who is involved in Nepali football. But that there will be no relegation is something that has not pleased Amobi, who feels the level of football might go down.
“For us, the teams who sign us up are the ones who’re serious about winning the league and with no relegation, teams that aren’t serious about winning the league might not want to sign up foreign players,” adds Amobi, who says he does not want to play in Nepal if he gets a better offer abroad.
Players such as Kone and Amobi are just a few who have made it. But, others who are not so lucky are not so lucky are sent home by clubs. The absence of league football has hampered the development of not just Nepali players, but these foreign players too who have suffered a lot, but the warm Nepali hospitality is what has kept most of them going in these time of trouble.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/african-footballers-in-nepal-what-they-give-to-and-get-from-a-faraway-land.html,sports
Historic day for Nepal cricket: Rhinos beat Dutch in close encounter,"Friday, August 3, 2018","
Kathmandu, August 3
Nepal’s national cricket team registered its first-ever ODI victory against the Dutch in Amstelveen in the second of the two-match series between the two sides.
Nepal, having won the toss, decided to bat first on a sunny day in Amstelveen. Nepal’s batsmen looked to dominate the Dutch bowling attack from the beginning, but the hosts continued to take wickets at regular intervals. But it was pacer Sompal Kami who rescued the innings to push Nepal’s score past 200 with his well calculated 61. Nepal could only muster 216.
The Dutch, meanwhile, seemed to be in cruise control in the beginning of their innings. But Nepali bowlers took wickets when it mattered and swung the match in favour of the tourists.
It was skipper Paras who claimed the last Dutch wicket to wrap up the Dutch innings and complete Nepal’s first victory in ODI cricket in the final ball of the match. The Dutch needed two runs of the final ball but a quick Paras Khadka ran the last Netherlands pair out to register a one run victory for Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/historic-day-for-nepal-cricket-rhinos-beat-dutch-in-close-encounter.html,sports
Nepal play their first one day international cricket match today,"Wednesday, August 1, 2018","Kathmandu, August 1
Nepal are playing the first match after obtaining the status of one day international with the hosts in the Netherlands on Wednesday.
It will be Nepal’s first match in the two-match limited over series. The match will begin at 2:45 pm Nepal time (11 am Dutch time) at VRA Ground, Amstelveen.
The second match has been scheduled for Friday.
The international cricket governing body had added Nepal to the list of ODI nations in June.
Meanwhile, on the eve of the match, Nepal’s captain Paras Khadka has stated that Nepal hope to keep the upward journey going with the new ODI status.
“I hope we can keep this going and continue to grow because our next goal is to become a Test-playing country,” he writes on ICC website, “We have worked hard for ODI status and the games against the Netherlands are opportunities for us to explore ourselves, enjoy the experience and hopefully put up good performances.”
“It is amazing to think back to how far we have come. Speaking personally, I started playing the game very young at school in Kathmandu. I played all the time – football in the rainy season and cricket the rest of the time,” an emotional skipper writes, “I never dreamed at that stage that I could play for my country but destiny had other things in mind! It was only when I was selected at under-15 level that things started to change.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-play-their-first-one-day-international-cricket-match-today.html,sports
Football finally came home… to France,"Monday, July 16, 2018","
When England hosted the 1996 European Championships, a song by Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and the Lightning Seeds inspired the popular chant: “football’s coming home”. Ahead of England’s World Cup semi-final defeat by Croatia, many fans were again talking about football coming home. But were they right to do so? After all, there is a chance that football will still be coming home – despite England’s elimination.
Given their team’s recent performances and their country’s role in the history of football, the French also have reason to feel that football has “come home”. This idea may be hard to swallow for some English fans, not least those who are getting the lyrics wrong.
Jules Rimet – the World Cup founder mentioned in the chorus of Football’s coming home – was French. So was Henri Delaunay, who is generally seen as the brains behind the European Championships. So was Gabriel Hanot, the L’Equipe journalist credited with founding the European Cup (now Champions League). Indeed, football’s world governing body the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, better known as FIFA, was founded in Paris in 1904 and its first president was another French journalist, Robert Guérin.
The first World Cup trophy was named after Jules Rimet, FIFA president 1921-1954. BnF
France has had a long history of establishing international sports tournaments and organisations. This in part stems from influential Frenchmen in the late 19th century such as Philippe Tissié, Paschal Grousset, and Pierre de Coubertin who became convinced of the educational and physical benefits of sport.
De Coubertin is best-known as the founder of the modern Olympics and he initially wanted the first games to take place in Paris, to coincide with the city’s 1900 Exposition Universelle. For De Coubertin and others, the development of international sport provided France with an instrument of soft power.
England were at this time somewhat suspicious of international sporting organisations, as the football sociologist John Williams has mentioned. It didn’t send a team to the World Cup until 1950, fully 20 years after the first tournament in Uruguay.
Nonetheless, England is often perceived as the home of football due to its role in the early development of the game. Sheffield FC (founded 1857) is heralded as the world’s first football team. The Football Association (FA), established in 1863, is the oldest national football association in the world and it is the FA that helped create the basis for the rules of football that exist today.
France’s oldest football team Le Havre were in fact created in 1872 by Englishmen working in the city’s port. Their sky blue and navy halved shirts represent the alma mater of the club’s founders, namely the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Le Havre’s club anthem even adopts the same tune as “God Save the Queen”.
However, Williams was right that it is not easy to define where football’s true home is to be found. The line “football’s coming home” appears to hint at a sense of entitlement and ownership when it comes to England’s relationship with football.
Yet football is a global game. Its governing body FIFA may have been founded in Paris, but its headquarters are now located in Zurich, Switzerland. England is no longer home to the International Football Association Board (IFAB) that is responsible for the laws of football. Its headquarters are now also in Zurich.
Given the role that France has played in football becoming a major international sport, are many French people talking about football potentially “coming home” this summer? In short, they’re not. This is largely due to football occupying a very different place in French as opposed to English culture.
France has a larger population than England, but less than half as many professional football teams. Prior to the launch of cable channel Canal Plus in 1984, relatively little domestic football was shown on French television. Nevertheless, hosting and winning the 1998 World Cup led to increased interest in football.
Since then, high-profile failures in several major tournaments have led to France’s leading footballers facing lots of criticism back home over their bad attitudes. In 2012, French football magazine So Foot hit back and claimed that France was a “country that has never understood anything about football”. These comments appeared in a special issue on “Why France doesn’t like its footballers”. France was also described in the title of a book that year by the journalist Joachim Barbier as “This country that doesn’t like football”, or Ce pays qui n’aime pas le foot, subtitled “why France misunderstands football and its culture”.
At a time when France has faced economic challenges and an increased threat from terrorism, football has the potential to boost the national mood. This year’s World Cup Final took place the day after a national holiday that marks Bastille Day. The victory by Les Bleus gives France good reason to claim le football revient chez lui two decades after its iconic 1998 World Cup victory.

World Cup VAR: Technology is transforming the beautiful game,"Tuesday, June 26, 2018","You may have noticed something different in the 2018 World Cup. For the first time ever, the Virtual Assistant Referee (VAR) system is being used to help make decisions during games. And already we are seeing it cause controversy.
It’s no surprise that VAR has caused debate, considering the furor that surrounded VAR in the English FA Cup and the Bundesliga. But although VAR receives huge attention, we should not forget that it is only the most visible example of the digitalisation of football, where data and technology is used to improve performance and decision-making. And digitisation is already transforming the game of football. But it is also leading many people to fear that the game is changing too fast and leaving fans behind.
VAR is a form of technology that is supposed to help referees make near-accurate decisions. As the game progresses, assistant referees away from the stadium watch instant replays of incidents. Over wireless headsets, they communicate with the referee, advising them on any game-changing incident. VAR is supposed to only assist referees in four main areas: goals, penalties, red cards and mistaken identity. But ultimately, the referee still has the final decision.
In 2017, VAR was introduced into the FA Cup for the first time. It was quickly blamed for ruining “the beautiful game”, by players and managers alike. Specific matches, especially between Tottenham and Rochdale in the FA Cup quarter final, caused particular ire after a Tottenham goal was reversed by VAR for reasons that were unclear.
There were remarkable scenes in the Bundesliga also. At half time, during a game between Mainz 05 and SC Freiburg, the teams were ordered back onto the pitch so that a retrospective penalty could be given after a VAR decision. Fans and players alike were less than happy.
VAR has already made its mark on this year’s World Cup. Although it has received positive feedback by some, it continues to cause intense debate. The technology was criticised for not flagging a penalty that allowed Switzerland to score against Brazil. And others criticised its role in the awarding of a French penalty against Australia. Many England fans also questioned the technology when the referee did not award a penalty after Harry Kane was wrestled to the ground by Tunisia’s Ferjani Sassi twice. Yet Tunisia scored on a penalty given for a similar foul.
Over the last few decades, it feels as if every aspect of life has been touched by “digitalisation”. And it has had a major impact in nearly every aspect of football. Whether it be TV coverage, ticketing or, perhaps most revolutionary of all, its capacity for teams to analyse and measure performance.
The unprecedented amount of data and information, that is produced through the Internet of Things, objects that are connected to the internet, enables better customised training. Teams can now collect enormous amount of data on how individual sports men and women perform in training and in actual matches. Coaches can use this data to give incredibly personalised feedback. It can also enable managers to make tactical decisions based upon live data, such as how far someone has run, where on the pitch they have been playing, and how many passes they have made, during the game. The future of football might be one in which teams are picked and play in a certain way “because of what the data says”.
Digitalisation is one of the major reasons why sport has transformed from a game played for entertainment and leisure into an industry worth over 1.5 trillion US$ globally. You only need to look at eSports, now a $400m industry, to see how digitalised sport has become.
But with VAR, many feel that digitalisation has gone a step too far and made football feel unnatural. There is something strange when fans have to hold off celebrating a goal until they receive confirmation from VAR. Many sports, particularly football, have a rich and symbolic heritage which some see as being under threat due to digitalisation. And it is not going to stop, with the Internet of Things, virtual reality and augmented reality increasingly being used in training grounds.
VAR might be getting the decision right (or not) and digitalisation might be making football more lucrative while improving the performance of players and the tactics of managers. But such “progress” also threatens to hamper the excitement and the spirit of the game. The fear is that as the relentless progress of technology continues, football might just lose the magic that made it so special.

Sanjeeb Shilpakar: This voice is synonymous with sports commentary in Nepal,"Wednesday, June 13, 2018","
Growing up in Kathmandu, Sanjeeb Shilpakar was one of the thousands of fans of the legendary radio presenter and Radio Nepal commentator Pandav Sunuwar. While others wondered about the face behind the famous voice, Shilpakar not only knew how Sunuwar looked like, he had the opportunity to accompany him to football matches.
“I knew him personally, and that made it easier for me. I used to ask him if I could accompany him to the grounds ; the gentleman ‘sir’ is, he never said no,” adds Shilpakar who knew from an early age that this was the man whose footsteps he wanted to follow.  “Sports was my passion,” he shares, “There was nothing I wanted to do more than this and as I look back it has been a wonderful journey.”
Shilpakar started his career with state broadcaster Nepal Television (NTV) in 2002 as a presenter for ‘Khel Khel’, a weekly sports show. But before that could happen, he hosted programmes around Patan to hone his skills. It was only a matter of time before he became a well known MC in his area. The NTV job gave him the break he had been yearning for, but working at the TV station was not easy, especially in the preinternet era.
“Back then, things were different. There was no internet and research was particularly hard,” he adds. For a young man who was mainly passionate about football, Shilpakar had to do cover all sports and that also was a bit of a challenge. “Live commentaries of football were easy compared to other sports because rules change and if you don’t know the rules it becomes hard. Tennis was particularly a different challenge as the commentators hardly speak in between points and the level of excitement is subdued as compared to cricket or football.” he shares.
“I started watching sports coverage outside Nepal and learned a lot from them. The fact that I understood things quickly made it very easy,” he adds.
Before the high speed internet age, journalism in Nepal was tough, especially sports reporting. Reporters had to go through a lot to make sure they got the correct information from their sources. “I remember when the Turkmenistan team came to Nepal I did a lot to get  a good story. But there was a problem; none of them spoke English which made it tough. But patiently, we did get the stories we were looking for,” he shares.
When Nepal’s teams travelled to other parts of Asia, the challenges would multiply. “As soon as something happened, I used to call Kathmandu to give them details. If you look at reporters now they have it very easy,” he adds.
Shilpakar has now become synonymous with sports commentary in Nepal–a generation of fans have grown up listening to him describe Bimal Gharti Magar’s goals and Sompal Kami’s wickets. In a career spanning over 16 years, Shilpakar has done it all. From commentating on badminton to hosting sports shows on Nepal Television, there is hardly any sport that Shilpakar hasn’t covered.
But this week Shilpakar enters into an unfamiliar zone as he will bring the FIFA World Cup to the Nepali audience, that too in Nepali. He recently joined Dish Home Media. “This is a new challenge in my life, one in which I hope I can pass with flying colours. It’s something new that we’re trying and maybe it will be received well by the viewers,” he adds.
We will have to wait and see if this new project of his will be a success or not but it is sure that Shilpakar will give his best. To make sure things will be ready, he is training a team of young football lovers to commentate alongside him. “I can’t do this alone which is why I have a team of young guys who are working extremely hard to make sure we have enough information as possible.”
In Nepal, everyone is a celebrity. Once you go viral on the internet, you’re famous. Take the example of ‘Tarkari Wali’, she went so viral that she even appeared in a recent movie. The internet has made everything so easy but Shilpakar has made it till here without the internet.
He’s a celebrity in his own right so much so that people recognise him through his voice rather than his name or face. “I feel very proud as people recognise me through my voice and I’m grateful to all the sports lovers and sports enthusiasts. A reason why I have never wanted to anything else.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sanjeeb-shilpakar-the-voice-thats-become-synonymous-with-sports-commentary-in-nepal.html,sports

When the poor sponsor the rich: Rwanda and Arsenal FC,"Wednesday, May 30, 2018","
Rwanda keeps surprising. Recently the Rwandan Development Board signed a sleeve sponsoring deal with London Premier League club, Arsenal. Over a three-year period, the 200 sq centimetre ad “Visit Rwanda” will cost the country USD$39 million.
President Paul Kagame is known to be a committed Arsenal fan. Recently, he even tweeted that the club needed a new coach after Arsenal’s once invincible league and cup winning manager Arsene Wenger’s poor record over the past number of seasons. One may suppose that it is a coincidence that the deal was struck just after Wenger’s retirement at the end of the 2017/18 season.
Rwanda is the 19th poorest country in the world with a per capita income of around USD$700. Arsenal is one of the richest football clubs in the world. It’s not surprising therefore that the nearly USD$40 million has upset quite a few people.
Dutch lawmakers, including some from the governing coalition, immediately reacted angrily to the news that such a poor country receiving a great deal of aid from The Netherlands would sponsor one of the world’s richest soccer clubs. Similar reactions could be heard in the UK, Rwanda’s second largest bilateral donor. An MP described the deal as “an own goal for foreign aid”.
In addition, those concerned with democracy and human rights think the deal is sending the wrong message about a country that has a strong authoritarian streak running through it.
The question is: Is Kagame entering into a deal with his favourite club to promote tourism or has he done it to enhance his image and shield him from criticism? He appears to have made the decision off his own bat: the contract appears not to have been discussed in the cabinet and the money does not figure in the budget approved by parliament.
For the Rwandan government, the deal is part of a broader strategy to develop tourism, which in 2017 accounted for about 12.7% of GDP and USD$400 million of revenue. The country sees upmarket leisure and convention tourism as an important growth sector. It has a lot going for it: lush green landscapes, the mountain gorillas of the Virunga volcanos, the Akagera wildlife park, the tropical Nyungwe forest, idyllic Lake Kivu, and even genocide memorials – all compressed into a space of just 26,000 sq kms.
This strategy is integrated and makes sense on paper. The state has invested heavily in its national airline RwandAir and built the Kigali Convention Centre and high-end hotels. And the development of the new Bugesera International Airport, designed to become a major regional hub, is underway.
But there are doubts about the profitability of these ventures. For instance, RwandAir has yet to break even 14 years after it was launched. The government keeps it afloat with an annual grant of USD$50 million just for operations.
Investments in a constantly expanding fleet to cater for an ever-growing network of continental and intercontinental destinations require considerable borrowing at a high cost. The fiscal risk involved in the government’s strategy is high, and economists wonder how sustainable these outlays will be in the medium term.
Calculations like these are for the Rwandan government to consider. But has Arsenal considered the signal it’s giving in light of Kagame’s human rights and democracy records?
Canadian investigative journalist Judi Rever recently recorded in a book, “In Praise of Blood: The Crimes of the Rwandan Patriotic Front”, that the Rwandan regime has massacred tens if not hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, particularly in the 1990s.
And last year Human Rights Watch issued worrying reports about human rights abuses. These included the rounding up and arbitrary detention of poor people in “transit centres” across the country, widespread repression in land cases, extrajudicial killings and unlawful detention and torture in military facilities.
In October 2017 the United Nations subcommittee on Prevention of Torture suspended its visit to Rwanda because of “a series of obstructions imposed by the authorities”. It was only the third time in 10 years the subcommittee has done this.
On top of this, there has been widespread analysis and commentary on the state of democracy in Rwanda. The country is a de facto one-party state with no meaningful political opposition, no press freedom and no independent civil society.
Kagame’s grip on power is absolute and in August last year, he was reelected with over 98% of the vote. A referendum on a constitutional amendment in 2015 gave him the right to stay in office until 2034.
Realising that battles are fought in the media as much, if not more than on the ground, Kagame’s party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has developed a formidable information and communication strategy stretching back to the civil war it launched in October 1990.
Kagame once said:
We used communication and information warfare better than anyone. We have found a new way of doing things.
This has involved paying those who can help promote the right image, including public relations firms.
True, political ethics and sports don’t match well. Until recently FC Barcelona agreed to a Qatar sponsorship that saw the country featured on the team’s jerseys. Qatar has a very chequered political record. Due to host the 2022 World Cup, it’s known for its notorious human rights abuse, especially when it comes to the rights of migrant workers and women.
Another example is Atlético Madrid which was controversially sponsored by Azerbaijan, where the Euro 2020 football tournament will take place. This east European country has been flagged by Amnesty International for its “crackdown on the right to freedom of expression, particularly following revelations of large-scale political corruption”.
Not that it should make any difference, but these two countries are very rich, while Rwanda is very poor.
And I nearly forgot: Many Arsenal fans were opposed to the deal, not because of Rwanda’s human rights and democracy records, but because they didn’t like the design of the sleeve print.

Just not cricket: why ball tampering is cheating,"Monday, March 26, 2018","In happier times: Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith talk to the media during the victorious Ashes series. AAP/Darren England
Australian cricket is engulfed in scandal after TV cameras caught Cameron Bancroft attempting to manipulate the condition of the ball during the team’s third Test match against South Africa. Bancroft and the Australian captain, Steve Smith, subsequently admitted to the offence and the collusion of the player leadership group in the decision to do so.
Altering the condition of the match ball is against the rules of the sport, contrary to “the spirit of cricket”, and deemed to be “unfair”. It is a form of cheating.
Cricket is not only controlled by a set of rules but, according to the sport’s laws, it should also be played “within the spirit of cricket”.
Like most sports, cricket is a self-regulating entity. The national associations and, ultimately, the International Cricket Council (ICC) enforce the laws. That said, cricket remains tied to gentlemanly ideals and the myth of “fair play”.
This “spirit” encourages respect for players and officials while advocating for self-discipline. Significantly, it says the:
… major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains.
Within these rules, law 41.3 identifies changing the condition of the match ball as an offence and “unfair play”. Specifically, law 41.3.2 states:
It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball.
But why is the condition of the ball so important?
The ability to “swing” a ball is a prized skill in cricket. Altering the condition of one side of the ball can help it to swing, and may provide an advantage to the bowling team.

Video explainer: Bowling strategies and decision-making in cricket
Players try regularly try to “rough up” one side of the ball by, for instance, deliberately bouncing it on hard ground or applying sweat or saliva to it in ingenious ways. Such practices are not deemed to be contrary to the laws, even if they may not be within the spirit of cricket. Cricketers can bend the rules but not break them.
However, others have been known to use fingernails to scratch the ball, or have rubbed it on the zip of their trousers. Such measures are against the laws and are punishable under the ICC’s Code of Conduct.
In this case, Smith has been banned for one match and fined his match fee. Bancroft, who was caught with a piece of yellow sticky tape that he was attempting to use to tamper with the ball, has also been fined most of his fee and issued three demerit points.


When games are evenly matched, small gains from cheating can be enough to swing the result one way. This has occurred in other sports.
Sport is now a commercial product with large rewards for winning. In addition, when players are representing their country, there may be considerable pressure to win at all costs, particularly when sport plays a prominent role in the country’s national identity.
According to Smith, the Australians “saw this game as such an important game”. Here, the significance of the game and the team’s desire to win are used to justify cheating. The spirit of cricket and “fair play” were given little thought.
In his work on match-fixing, investigative journalist Declan Hill identifies several questions that may be considered when players are contemplating cheating. The importance of the game is a key factor. Prospective cheats will also evaluate whether they can win without cheating and the sanctions they risk if they are caught.
The Australian cricketers believed the game was slipping away from them. They either did not think they would be caught, or were not deterred by the possible sanctions.
In several cases of cheating, it has been senior players that have induced their younger teammates to cheat.
Two former cricket captains, South Africa’s Hansie Cronje and Pakistan’s Salman Butt, both recruited younger, less experienced players in their attempts to manipulate cricket matches. Similarly, Bancroft is at the start of his Test career and appears to have been influenced by others in the team.
Rather than ensuring fair play, Smith contrived to break both the game’s laws and spirit. Worryingly, it was not just Smith and Bancroft, but a group of senior players who were initially involved.
The players will have evaluated whether it was morally right to cheat and decided that winning was more important. While not a “crime” in the traditional sense of the word, the premeditated nature of these actions increases the level of deception and subsequent outrage surrounding the decision.
The event calls into question not only the behavioural integrity of those involved but also more broadly the moral integrity of the environment in which they function. This is an environment that leaves players viewing ball-tampering on this scale as a viable match-winning strategy.
Smith’s role, as captain, has often been described as the second-most-important job in Australia (after the prime minister). It is for this reason that the Australian Sports Commission has called for him, along with any members of the leadership group or coaching staff “who had prior awareness of, or involvement in, the plan to tamper with the ball”, to stand down or be sacked.
The plot to tamper with the ball was a clear attempt to cheat and has brought the spirit of cricket into question. The implications of being caught cheating or significance of the action were overruled in favour of an outcome: winning a match.
Such actions demonstrate the short-term focus players can have in the moment, ignoring the magnitude of their decisions. In this case, the fallout will be far greater than any punishment the sport will hand out.

Rohit Paudel: Meet Nepal cricket’s fifteen-year-old firefighter,"Friday, March 23, 2018","
Four years ago, an eleven-year-old boy from Nawalparasi came to Kathmandu to peruse his dream of becoming a cricketer. The same boy recently played a match-winning innings against Hong Kong to keep Nepal’s hopes of achieving ODI status alive.
Rohit Kumar Paudel at a tender age of 15 is aware of the pressure cricketers face when they take on the field so much that he says he feels comfortable batting in difficult situations. “It’s part of the game,” he says with a smile on his face. “I’m starting to enjoy the pressure. Yes, it’s a bit difficult to do it every match, but if you pace your innings well, nothing is difficult.”
Paudel grew up in Nawalparasi watching his elder brother and others play tennis ball cricket. Even though he tried his hand at other sports, from an early age cricket was what made him happy. “I wanted to become a cricketer after I saw Nepal play in the World T20 in Bangladesh. Watching Paras Khadka and others play the World T20 gave me the motivation.”
Paudel says Khadka is his idol and he has been impressed by the way the captain motivates the team. “He is amazing and always leads from the front. During the past two tournaments, I’ve learned a lot from him, he is truly an inspiration,” he adds.
Like Khadka, Paudel had a similar route to the national team. He came to Kathmandu and joined Balwatar Cricket Club where he learned the techniques of the game and was groomed into an all-rounder just like Khadka. Rikesh Lama, a coach at Balwatar Cricket Club, felt he could easily make it into the team even as a ‘pure’ batsman.
As competition was tough in Kathmandu, Lama suggested that Paudel to go to Bhairawa for the U-19 trials. “I knew I had to perform well if I had any chance of getting selected. Coach Jagat Tamatta along with Binod Das and Raman Siwakoti were there and luckily I got selected and was called to Kathmandu for a training camp.”
When he came to Kathmandu, there were 52 other boys of his age waiting for a spot on the junior side. After performing well, he was selected in the 15 that would represent Nepal in the 2016 U-19 Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. The tournament didn’t go as well as Paudel had wanted it to, but he remembers the unbeaten 68 he made against India. His contribution with the bat had helped Nepal post a respectable score against a strong Indian squad.
The innings he played under pressure caught the eye of the selectors and he was chosen by the Kathmandu franchise in the inaugural Dhangadhi Premier League. Paudel had a lot of hopes from the tournament, but he had a tournament he would want to forget. “But I worked hard and was later picked by Bhairawa in the inaugural EPL.”
The tournament proved to be a turning point in the youngster’s career as he was named the man of the match in one of the encounters and the most valuable player of the tournament. A solid performance in the tournament earned him a call-up from the senior team. “I was called for the month-long camp at the TU ground. That was the moment when I felt I would play for the national team.”

After good performances in the camp, Paudel was selected in the team that would take part in World Cricket League Division 2 in Namibia. “I didn’t know that I had been selected. It was my elder brother who called me and told me,” he says, “Everyone in my family was happy that my dream of playing for Nepal was now becoming a reality.”
His debut game came against Namibia. He became the youngest player ever to play for Nepal, a record previously held by teammate Sandeep Lamichhane. “It was a tough game, I came to the crease when we were five down and I had to play sensible cricket and not throw my wicket away.”
Even though Paudel got out and couldn’t see the team through, the coaches and captain Khadka told Paudel that he played a mature innings taking the conditions into consideration. Another game that comes to mind when talking about Paudel is the one against Kenya. He came to the pitch when Nepal were five down again. He played a match-winning innings alongside Aarif Sheikh. The duo put on an 87 run stand which helped Nepal win the match.
But Paudel was unhappy that he couldn’t finish the job as he was run out.
“If I had been there until the end, a separate confidence would have crept in but we won that match and I am really happy,” he says.
Nepal qualified for the world cup qualifiers but Paudel wasn’t fazed by it. He also mentions that he isn’t bothered by pressure. “You feel pressure every time you get in the middle. But after you play 10-15 balls your nerves settle down.”
Paude,l like every other player had one thing in mind, to get an ODI status and reach the super six. Nepal didn’t have the best of starts as they lost three games on the trot. The last match in the group stage became a must-win for them to play ODI cricket.

Nepal bowled well and packed Hong Kong for 153 which they had to chase by the 45th over to get ahead of Hong Kong. But Nepal got off to a dreadful start as they were 5/66 in the 20th over and with talisman Khadka out cheaply, the side was staring at defeat.
“Looking back it was a tough situation. But the captain and the coach told me to play my game and not throw away my wicket. My game plan was simple – win the game by the 40th over and build a partnership with Sompal Kami. Kami played a great-run-a-ball inning which helped us win the match.”
Paudel’s unbeaten 48 earned him the man of the match award and also a bat from the Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai ‘for helping his side get the super six.’
The rest of the tournament wasn’t as good but Paudel has taken a lot of positives from his time with the national team. At 15, he has done what many can only dream of achieving. He says playing against international teams has made him a better cricketer and one day hopes to follow in the footsteps of Lamichhane to play the IPL alongside his namesake Rohit Sharma.
But for now, he has his feet planted on the ground. He wants to work on his techniques and especially work on his ability to play spin. At such a young age he is mature and believes in himself. “The welcome we got at the airport was amazing. I want that every time.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rohit-paudel-meet-nepal-crickets-fifteen-year-old-firefighter.html,sports
Liverpool FC’s Mohamed Salah’s goal celebrations: a guide to British Muslimness,"Monday, March 19, 2018","Liverpool FC’s Egyptian-born forward is currently one of the Premier League’s most prolific goalscorers. This, his debut season with Liverpool, has seen Salah earn multiple accolades: most left-footed goals scored in a Premier League season, second-fastest player in Liverpool’s history to reach 30 goals, one of the top ten goalscorers in Europe, and 2017 African Footballer of the Year.
He shows no signs of lowering his goal tally as the season goes on, with commentator and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher viewing Salah as a strong contender for another Player of the Year award. In a league that is regularly touted as so open that any team can win, lose, or draw against any other, unpredictability is the name of the game. Yet this season, Salah’s consistent goalscoring record seems to buck that trend. Salah’s counterattacking form was of particular concern for Manchester United when they played Liverpool on March 10, as they sat deep and defended against the Merseyside club for much of the match.
Beautiful though they are to watch, what I find most interesting about Salah’s goals are his celebrations and their reception. Because consistently, Salah does two things after scoring. First, he hugs his teammates, a typical response. But then, he performs sujood, the Islamic act of prostration.
Sujood normally occurs twice in every section of salaat – a word commonly mistranslated as prayer (following its Arabic root, salaat is better translated as “connection”). A Muslim who performs salaat the requisite five times daily finds themself in sujood 34 times each day. In Islamic thought, sujood is perceived of as the physically lowest, but spiritually highest, position a person can take. Salah’s performance of sujood outside of salaat, then, is a specific expression of gratitude for goals scored.
Though many other Premier League footballers are Muslim, Salah is the only one who regularly prostrates on the pitch.
Liverpool fans have taken note. After his recent Champions League goal against the Portuguese side Porto in Liverpool’s 5-0 victory, some fans developed a chant praising him:
Mo Sa-la-la-la-lah, Mo Sa-la-la-la-lah
If he’s good enough for you he’s good enough for me.
If he scores another few then I’ll be Muslim too.
If he’s good enough for you he’s good enough for me.
He’s sitting in the mosque that’s where I wanna be.
The chant, which is a rewrite of lyrics from the 1996 song Good Enough by British power pop rock trio, Dodgy, quickly went viral on Twitter and YouTube. News outlets including Al Jazeera and the BBC laud the chant as a demonstration of inclusivity. It is catchy, for sure. But is it inclusive? It’s not quite that simple.
Salah’s work and the chant itself fit squarely into two common narratives: that of the good Muslim/bad Muslim; and the good immigrant. Articulated by political scientist Mahmood Mamdani, among others, the good Muslim/bad Muslim binary portrays the “good” as those who appease society by accepting majority values and customs, while the “bad” are those who resist it religiously, culturally, or politically.
The “good” Muslim is the “hero” imam of Finsbury Park, who stopped worshippers from beating up a terrorist named Darren Osborne after he drove a van into a crowd during Ramadan 2017. The “bad” Muslim is the director of the “controversial” advocacy group CAGE, who refused to allow police to search his laptop and mobile phone under Schedule 7 powers granted to the British government by the Terrorism Act.
This binary maps onto those immigrants who are perceived of as “good”. In his note that opens The Good Immigrant, editor Nikesh Shukla references writer Musa Okwonga when arguing:
The biggest burden facing people of colour in this country is that society deems us bad immigrants – job-stealers, benefit-scroungers, girlfriend-thieves, refugees – until we cross over in their consciousness, through popular culture, winning races, baking good cakes, being conscientious doctors, to become good immigrants.
Salah is one of those good immigrants.
And here is the paradox of his sujood. Being praised by non-Muslim Liverpool supporters as “good” is positive, of course. But it is conditional. The chant makes clear that it is only “if” Salah continues to score goals that his displays of Muslimness will be accepted. It is only “if” he remains good that he will continue to be worshipped by them. It is only “if” he furthers his professional excellence that opinions about Islam may shift.
Addictive as it is, the chant flies in the face of spoken word poet Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan’s demand that society move beyond loving the Muslim who excels in athletics or bakery to include those who “don’t offer our homes or free taxi rides after the event” and are “wretched, suicidal, naked, and contributing nothing”. The double-edged sword of Salah’s sujood is that it is tied to his excellence on the field.
If he stops scoring, he will stop performing sujood. As a result, fans will love him – and Islam – a little less.

Historic moment for Nepal cricket: Rhinos get ODI status for first time in history,"Thursday, March 15, 2018","
Kathmandu, March 15
When the ICC World Cup Qualifiers began in Zimbabwe two weeks ago, the full members playing the tournament had one objective: to qualify for the ICC cricket World Cup. But for associate teams playing in the tournament, it was more than just about qualifying for the World Cup, it was about gaining ODI status from the ICC.
Ahead of the  tournament, the ICC announced that top three associate teams at the end of the tournament will receive ODI status and a chance to play the World Cricket League Championship. This translates to more funding from the ICC, prospect of organising more matches and getting the ICC nod to play the four-day Intercontinental Cup tournament.
Although three spots were up for grabs, there were five contenders. Two teams would go home relegated to the second division.
While Nepal made a shaky start to the tournament, the UAE and Scotland made it to the Super Six, ensuring that they finish at least sixth in the tournament. It became all but certain that the UAE and Scotland would get two of three ODI slots available. But the third slot was yet to be filled.
The race was between Hong Kong, Nepal and PNG to finish ahead of the pack and to get ODI status. The equation had become simple, Nepal would have to beat PNG and the Netherlands would have to beat Hong Kong. Nepal easily beat PNG, but he Netherlands vs Hong Kong game went to the wire with the Netherlands edging the Asian side. A valiant effort by skipper Babar Hayat was not enough to get the 174 runs needed to win the match and the ODI status.
With the result, Hong Kong and PNG are relegated to Division 2. They will now have to play Division 2, finish either first or second, and then qualify for the World Cricket League. Meanwhile, Nepal get ODI status.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/historic-moment-for-nepal-cricket-rhinos-get-odi-status-for-first-time-in-history.html,sports
"ICC World Cup Qualifiers: For Nepal, tournament now about staying in Division I","Sunday, March 11, 2018","
Watching Nepal play in the World Cup is every Nepali fan’s dream. But that dream has ended after the Rhinos lost to Afghanistan by six wickets on Saturday at Bulawayo.
With the loss, it is almost certain that Nepal won’t make it to the Super Six, and even if they do make it through (a theoretical possibility remains), they carry over 0 points from the group stage–that won’t be enough to get them to the World Cup. If Nepal end up in 7th or 8th place in the tournament, they are relegated to Division 2.
Here’s how things stand ahead of the Group B matchup between Hong Kong and Nepal on Monday: Afghanistan and HK are joint third in the table with two points each, but the Afghans have a better run rate than Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong still have a game in hand.
Here are the likely scenarios:
If Nepal beat Hong Kong, they get two points. Then, Afghanistan, Nepal and Hong Kong share the third spot in the table and the team with the best run rate goes through to the Super Six stage. If Nepal beat Hong Kong by a huge (unprecedented) margin, then Nepal go through to the Super Sixes. If Nepal bat first, they need to score more than 300 and bowl Hong Kong out for less than 80 runs.
If Nepal score around 250/260, they would have to bowl Hong Kong out for 30-35 runs.
But what if Nepal bowl first? If Nepal bowl first, the chances look even slimmer. If Nepal bowl HK out for around a 100-150 they have to chase down the runs in 2-3 overs. Nepal’s safest bet is: to win the toss, bat first and get around 350-380 on the board and give themselves a fighting chance to bowl Hong Kong out for around 120.
If Nepal beat Hong Kong and the margin is not big enough to see them through to the Super Sixes, Afghanistan secure a place in the second round of the tournament. Nepal and Hong Kong then head to the seventh/eighth place play0ffs.
If Hong Kong beat Nepal, they qualify for the second round of the tournament. Nepal and Afghanistan then head to the seventh/eighth place qualifier.
Meanwhile in Group A, if the Netherlands beat the West Indies and Ireland beat the UAE with a margin of 80 or more runs, then Netherlands will qualify the next round by leapfrogging the UAE.
As Nepal’s hopes of reaching the second stage of the tournament look unreal, the next best thing for the side would be to get the ODI status and play the World Cricket League Championship, a tournament designed by the ICC for Associate countries with ODI status. According to the ICC, top three of the five Associates (except the Netherlands, who already have ODI status regardless the result of the tournament) playing the tournament get ODI status.
It is certain that Scotland will finish the tournament as the top Associate. If UAE and Hong Kong reach the second round, they will claim the second and the third spots. In such a scenario, Nepal and PNG will be relegated to Division II.
But if both Hong Kong and the UAE do not make it to the second round, two of the three ODI spots will be decided in the playoffs and Nepal would have a better chance of avoiding relegation.
Theoretically, any one of the three teams could qualify for the Super Six stage of the tournament. Nepal hope against hope that they beat Hong Kong, Ireland beat the UAE and the Netherlands beat the West Indies on Monday. That would be the most favourable situation for Nepal as the contest for two ODI spots will be decided in the playoffs.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/icc-world-cup-qualifiers-for-nepal-tournament-now-about-staying-in-division-i.html,sports
"Meet Sunil Lama, the only Nepali national to play ODI cricket, ever!","Sunday, March 11, 2018","
At the training facility of Balwatar Cricket Club, Sunil Lama (aka Sher Bahadur Lama) is putting young players through their paces. One of his students drops a simple catch and he doesn’t look impressed.
Lama (45) says he sees his younger self in these budding cricketers, who aspire to play for the national one day–the same way he did. Lama, who is the only Nepali national to play an ICC-recognised One Day International cricket match till date, would go on to live his dream but in a surreal way.
Born to an ex-British Gurkha, Lama grew up in Manipur, India and went to an army school in Shilliong. He tried his hands at many things before playing cricket in class six. “I wasn’t into cricket in my early days. I was a decent hockey player. I played in a lot of state-level games,” says Lama. “I played cricket for fun.”
After completing his Bachelors in Engineering at the age of 21, he came to Kathmandu and looked for hockey teams. But after failing to find one, he joined Balwatar Cricket Club(BCC) one of Nepal’s oldest cricket clubs established over 40 years ago by Upendra Nath Bhattrai. “I joined the club after I met a few BCC members playing cricket. They were in need of a wicketkeeper and I fit the bill,” he recalls.
He played there for a few years before going to Hong Kong in 1995. “I had to leave Nepal because my father was there and my family persuaded that at 23, I shouldn’t miss out on getting a PR which is why I settled in Hong Kong,” he adds. Back then opportunities were limited in Nepal. The cricketing culture was just emerging but playing cricket for a living was unheard of. To lead a better life for himself and his family, going to Hong Kong seemed like a good idea for him.
“To be honest I wanted to play hockey there too but I didn’t find any team I could represent so I decided to stick to cricket.”
After going to Hong Kong he joined Kowloon Cricket Club and started playing in the domestic league where he had a good run. The experience he’d earned playing national tournaments here in Nepal helped him perform well. But his heart was back in Nepal, the team he wanted to play for.

“It’s quite unfortunate I think, I really wanted to represent Nepal and even came here to play the national games in Nepalgunj where I had a good tournament. After the tournament, the selectors asked me to participate in the closed camp for one month but I couldn’t do so due to work commitments in Hong Kong,” he adds.
The decision to not show up at the closed camp would cost him a place in the national squad. With a heavy heart, Lama returned to Hong Kong, where he continued to perform well for his club. He caught the eyes of the selectors soon and received a call to play for Hong Kong. In 1998, he was selected for the national squad of Hong Kong to play the 1998 ACC Trophy and his debut match was against his own country Nepal! Lama’s team beat Nepal by six wickets.
Lama played for Hong Kong for a decade. In those years he played against Nepal two more times. “The most memorable of the matches against Nepal came during the ACC Trophy in 2000,” he says.
“I still remember that game like it happened yesterday.
“That was a weird game for me. The match was the semi-final of the ACC trophy and we had to win to qualify for the Asia Cup, where we could play against teams like India and Pakistan.”
“Our team played well and put up a good score on the board. They always say runs on the boar is important in a big game and 268 seemed like a good score.”

The tournament was taking place in the UAE and Lama recalls there were a lot of Nepalis fans there.
“Our bowlers got a good start as we got Paresh Lohani and Mahboob Alam cheaply. I was given the ball in the third over and in my second ball, I got Joshi. Nepal were restricted to just 89.”
Lama says winning the match and earning a ticket to the Asia Cup was a bittersweet moment for him. “As a professional, I felt great but it was a weird feeling. The Nepali fans called me a traitor.”
But that would not deter Lama, who believes that it was his profession to play for Hong Kong. In 2004, his team played the Asia Cup against teams like India and Pakistan. That is how Lama, who still holds his Nepali citizenship close to his heart, became the first Nepali to play One Day International cricket.
Lama played for Hong Kong for over a decade and received his coaching license there. Then he decided to return to Nepal. “I wanted to stay in cricket and started coaching in 2006. After getting my ACC Level 3 coaching license I became the coach of Hong Kong’s U-15s, U-19s. I even brought the teams to Nepal to train. Players like Anshuman Rath were part of my team,” he adds.
He wanted to give something back to Nepali cricket and develop it. In 2015 and started coaching at the BCC, where is currently the head coach.“This has always been my club. In the past three years I have tried to bring a lot of changes starting with grassroots level,” he says stating that without improving grassroots level cricket will not improve.
To give exposure to the players he has been taking them on tours to places like Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Thailand. “We need to go to other countries so that we can see what level we are at. It gives the kids a chance to learn and evaluate their strengths and weakness.” He feels a lot can be done to develop cricket here in Nepal but the environment here doesn’t let that happen.
Nepal will face Hong Kong in the world cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe tomorrow. Which team will he root for?
“Of course I will say I will root for Nepal. I want Nepal to do well. Some of our graduates from the academy are playing and I really hope they do well,” he says with a smile on his face.
“There is something special about representing your nation at any sporting event. It gives you immense pride and satisfaction to wear represent the national team in any sport. I hope these youngsters here get to wear their own colours.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sunil-lama-odi-nepal-cricket-ever.html,sports
Nepal vs Afghanistan: Five mini contests that will determine the outcome of the match,"Friday, March 9, 2018","
Nepal and Afghanistan lock horns tomorrow in what is now a must-win game for both the sides in the World Cup Qualifiers being played in Zimbabwe. After a good show in World Cricket League(WCL) Div 2, Nepal have fallen short of their expectation to reach the super six after losing two games on the bounce against Zimbabwe and Scotland. Afghanistan haven’t had a good tournament either after losing to Hong Kong yesterday and now have lost all three games played so far in the tournament. Both Nepal and Afghanistan are tied on zero points and both are looking to get their first points on the boards.
Here are five mini-contests that will determine the game at Bulawayo tomorrow:


It’s a captain vs captain affair when these two go head on. Nepal in recent times have been over-dependent on their captain when it comes to batting. Paras has scored 63, 40, 28, 112* in his last four matches. If you look at it since ICC WCL Div2, Paras Khadka has scored 25 per cent  of total runs scored by the entire Nepal team. If Nepal are to do well Paras has to continue his good form once again, especially against his counterpart Rashid Khan.
If Afghanistan want to stop Nepal, Khan has to play well. Khan is the first teenager to captain a men’s international side and the youngest player ever, male or female, to captain a full international match. Thursday was his off day as it was only the fifth time in 38 ODIs that Khan hasn’t taken a wicket. If Afghanistan want to win this match, Khan has come good with both ball and bat.


If its Khadka who’s impressing with the bat, it Sandeep Lamichhane who is doing so with the ball. The young leggie has develped quite a reputation after being picked by Delhi Daredevils and St Kitts for tje IPL and the CPL. If you look closely, he has picked 37 per cent of all wickets claimed by Nepal. That is why he needs to be at his best when he faces one of the most experienced Afghanistan batsmen with over a 100 List A matches under his belt: Mohammad Nabi.
Nabi is undoubtedly Afghanistan’s in-form player with both the bat and the ball. In the last three games that they have lost, Nabi has been their lone star performer scoring 181 runs and taking four wickets. If Nepal want to win this match, they have to get the experienced Nabi early just like they did in the 2014 T20 World Cup match in Bangladesh.


Gyanendra Malla needs to step up if Nepal have any hope of qualifying for the Super Six. In his last nine innings, he has scored 114 runs at an average of 12, which is pretty low for an experienced top order batsman. He will have a tough task to better that average when he faces Afghanistan’s opening bowler Dawlat Zadran.
Dawlat Zadran is one of the most promising fast bowlers to come out an associate nation and is famous for his slightly unorthodox action, which is reminiscent of Waqar Younis during his day. Consistently clocking over 140kph, his bowling is  sure to trouble Nepal’s batsmen. His hard-hitting at the bottom of the order will also be valuable in what is a somewhat inconsistent batting line-up.


The 22-year-old fast bowler hasn’t had the best of times in the qualifiers, picking up only two wickets so far. He has to bowl well at the start to give Nepal any hope of reaching the super sixes. The flat tracks in Zimbabwe haven’t helped him either and his extra pace might give the Afghanistan batsmen the edge.
Facing Kami first up will be Ihsanullah who is another Afghanistan player who has underperformed in this tournament–having reached double figures only once. His battle with Kami first up will decide where the match will go.

Lalit Rajbanshi vs Najibullah Zadran

Lalit Rajbansi caught the eye of the selectors following his performance in the 2017 Everest Premier League and was handed his debut against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the qualifiers. His performances haven’t been great, but this is right match to show everyone that he belongs to the big league. But as he will be bowling in the middle overs he needs to be wary of the explosive Najibullah Zadran.
Zadran had an impressive series against Zimbabwe and has continued his form in the qualifiers as well scoring 103 runs in three games. His explosive batting style means he is a player who takes risks and maybe Nepal’s young slow-left armer can get him cheaply.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-vs-afghanistan-five-mini-contests-that-will-determine-the-outcome-of-the-match.html,sports

How EPL fan clubs are spicing up football culture in Kathmandu,"Thursday, February 22, 2018","Twenty-nine-year-old Sanjay Shrestha always looks forward to the weekends. It is that time of the week when his favourite team Manchester United take to the field.
“This Sunday, United play Chelsea in the English Premier League, and I am heading to Sports Hive in Jhamsikhel to watch the match with fellow United supporters,” he says adding that he’s already counting down to Sunday night.
“I won’t go to college if Manchester United lose. There is a lot at stake. I don’t like it when we lose because most of my friends are Chelsea fans and they’d make my week miserable so we have to win,” says another fan Sanjeev Aryal, who is also looking forward to the Sunday encounter.
Shrestha and Aryal are two of the thousands of Nepali football fans, most of whom are young men, who passionately follow international football, especially the Premier League. The English Premier League (or EPL as it is commonly known) is the most-watched football league in the world. Since its inception in 1992, it has gone on to become a global phenomenon followed vigorously across the world. Every match gets over a million of viewers and is followed in nearly 200 countries.
When Sergio Aguero scored a last-gasp winner in May 2012, it wasn’t just the Etihad Stadium that erupted with jubilation. That goal set off a storm here in Kathmandu as well with fans even after six years sit and talk about how Manchester City defying all odds went on to lift their first title in over 40 years.
No other league creates such drama. That game and that season might have made Premier League a global phenomenon it is now, but in Nepal, it started to plant its seeds well before that. The Premier League has been available on TV in Nepal for over two decades, but since the last decade its fan following has risen massively and little credit should be given to social media. As the League started getting popular, fans started making Facebook groups to see how many fans their respective clubs had. Chelsea Nepal was the first to do so. Eventually, they formally launched a group with around five members. Soon the word spread and other fans started to group to pledge allegiance to their clubs.
As years went by, what started as a group of people watching football has grown on to something really big. All the major fan clubs in Nepal i.e., Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspurs have received official recognition from their respective clubs in the UK. This has enabled members to get tickets to games in the UK with relative ease and the clubs also send signed merchandises on a regular basis. The fan clubs also host AGMs every year where some of them launch T-shirts and hoodies.
Liverpool Nepal were the most organised group. They organised match-day screenings and meeting on a regular basis. But hosting a screening for over 50 people was a challenge, claims Piyush Neupane, Chairman of LFC Nepal. “It was tough for us to start as restaurants and bars hardly showed EPL matches back then. But as I had good terms with the owner of Lakhey Restro and Bar, I proposed the idea of screening matches. We screened our first match in August 2007 and got a good response from our members, after which we started to hold regular screenings,” says Neupane.
Jaysal Thapaliya, an Arsenal fan, started a club in late 2008 with only one motive: to watch games with fellow ‘gooners’. “I used to sit and watch games all by myself. When I saw fans in England visiting pubs, singing chats and watching the team they love together, I wanted to do the same,” adds Thapaliya, the founder of Arsenal Nepal which was recognised as the first official fan club in Nepal by the British club.
The same wasn’t the case for Manchester United because of their fan base. Manchester United is the most popular football club in Nepal which is why it was hard to initially kickstart a fan club. But in 2016, they received official recognition from the Manchester United and now boast the highest number of fans in Nepal.
What these fan clubs have done is establish a footballing culture. The rivalry that exists in England exists here too. They also host intra and inter-fan club futsal tournaments. A few years ago, these fan clubs united together for a noble cause as they hosted an event called ‘Momo for a Change’. It was a charity event for the welfare of street children where the members made momo for the kids and also donated clothes so the children could keep warm in the winter.
As club football in Nepal is at its lowest point, the English Premier League has given football lovers something to look forward to every week. As every fan wishes to see their club play live, all that’s left is for one of these clubs to come play at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu. But there’s a more pressing issue at hand, Shrestha and Aryal have an important match to catch this weekend.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/epl-fan-clubs-football-culture.html,sports
The agony and ecstasy of being Nepali cricket’s ’12th man’,"Wednesday, February 21, 2018","Supporting the Nepali cricket team and following their international matches is not an easy task. It requires a lot of patience, and dedication–it definitely is not for the faint-hearted.
As the team, which recently won a spot in the World Cup Qualifers, prepares for a big match, the buzz on social media starts a few weeks before the first ball is bowled. Fans take to social media to advise the selectors on who should play and who should be dropped.
“Binod Bhandari, why is he still in the team?” asked a fan on a Facebook page, which has more than 500,000 followers. Within a few minutes, comments start pouring in. “He is out of form. Although he bats at one of the most important positions, he hasn’t been playing well,” another replies.
But a more important issue still remains unaddressed. Nepal only has one cricket ground where international matches can be played. This means that big tournaments such as the recently concluded ICC World Cricket League Division 2, which featured six teams, cannot be played in Nepal–the tournament runs on a tight schedule and at least three grounds are needed.
Will the matches be streamed online or broadcast on TV? This is the million-rupee question that everyone wants answered. If the match is being played in Nepal, the state-run TV broadcasts the fixture live, but outside of Nepal, it doesn’t follow the team. In the last two years, only four international matches were played in Nepal, and broadcast on state TV.
When international matches do take place in Nepal, the legion of supporters brave the weather to come watch the game. Even during weekdays, a crowd of around 50,000 gather easily to watch the game. They shout and they cheer for every run the Nepali batsmen score and encourage the team when they lose the grip on the match.
The atmosphere is electric. In the words of former Namibian skipper Stephen Baard and Hong Kong’s ace batsman Anshuman Rath, it is every associate cricket team’s dream to play in front of such a crowd. There are even those who say that the Nepali spectators are the ’12th man’ of the squad, in recognition of their contribution to the team. Nepal’s skipper Paras Khadka never forgets to mention the ‘fans’ whenever he talks about the success of the sport in Nepal.

More often than not, there is neither a live broadcast nor a live stream available for the match. Fans have to resort to ‘watching’ their hero Paras Khadka hit sixes in boring texts that don’t even care to describe how the six was hit. They have to make use of their imagination to enjoy Karan KC’s blitzkrieg against Canada or Sandeep Lamichhane’s fifer against Kenya, that too while commuting home from work.
Big TV companies that have occupied rights to broadcast the matches do not find it lucrative to broadcast Nepal’s matches as advertisers and sponsors do not see a market for their products in Nepal. The ICC’s media accreditation policy makes it impossible for reporters based in Nepal to cover the matches live. While there is enough interest in the game to encourage publishers to send reporters abroad to cover key matches, the ICC does not allow them to broadcast, livestream or even provide ball by ball updates, not even on Twitter. Nepal’s Cricket Association, meanwhile, can’t even think of broadcasting the matches as it is serving an ICC-imposed suspension.
When the issue of where and how to watch the match is settled, the team’s performance takes the centre stage. Well, Nepal have done well to get to World Cricket League Division 1, but they too have had bad days. During the 2015-18 season of the World Cricket League, Nepal lost nine out of their 14 matches in the tournament. Around 3-4 of the matches were pretty close and could have gone either way. For a Nepali fan, the game is not over until it is over. Keeping track of the ‘close’ matches through text updates is an arduous task, you need to keep your eye on the screen the whole time.
Then there are rare moments when Nepal pull off the unthinkable. A lost match is won, and Nepal march ahead in their dream to play the ICC Cricket World Cup. That was what happened last week when Nepal beat Canada in the defacto semifinal of the World Cricket League Division 2. Nepal now play the ICC World Cup Qualifiers in Zimbabwe.
Social media is already abuzz, the fans are eagerly waiting for the tournament to begin. It’s still not certain how many of Nepal’s matches will be broadcast live. The Nepali team may not even put up a fight against big names such as Zimbabwe or Afghanistan, or perhaps they may. But that won’t stop the fans from keeping track of every ball bowled. That is the agony and ecstasy of being Nepal’s ’12th man’.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-agony-and-ecstasy-of-being-nepali-crickets-12th-man.html,sports

"Nepal beat Canada in last-ball thriller, qualify for World Cup Qualifers","Wednesday, February 14, 2018","
Kathmandu, February 14
Nepal beat Canada in a last-ball thriller to book a place in ICC World Cup Qualifers, to be played in in Zimbabwe next month.
The hero of the match World Cricket League Division II encounter was Karan KC, who came in at number 10 to rescue Nepal from a big defeat. KC made 42 off 31 balls and remained unbeaten to see the side through.
Having won the toss, Nepal put Canada to bat first in the final match of the league stage of the tournament being played in Namibia. The North American side put up a challenging score of 194 runs in their allotted 50 overs with the loss of eight wickets.  Canada’s opening batsman Wijeratne scored a century and remained unbeaten even as wickets tumbled. Nepal conceded 19 extras and that was likely to hurt the side.

Nepal’s response to the total was rocky from the start. Vice-captain Gyanendra Malla was made nine runs. His opening partner Dilip Nath made 41. Although wickets were falling at regular intervals Nepal managed to keep the run-rate in check. At one point in the game Nepal were 144-9, still needing 51 runs to win the match.
KC hit four towering sixes and four fours to ensure that Nepal finished the match in style.

[Watch] Sandeep Lamichhane’s fifer against Kenya,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018","
Nepal’s teenage bowling sensation Sandeep Lamichhane made his debut for the national side in 2016. In just two years, he has become one of the most potent weapons in Nepal’s bowling armoury Lamichhane’s variety and his ability to spin the ball on any surface makes him a difficult bowler to read. On Monday, Lamichhane was in action against rivals Kenya in the penultimate league match of the ongoing World Cricket League Division II, being played in Namibia. Due to lack of live coverage of the match, Nepali fans missed out on watching Lamichhane claim his fifer against the African side. However, courtesy of the International Cricket Council, we can see how the ‘Daredevil’ turned the tide of the match in Nepal’s favour. Lamichhane bowled 10 overs and conceded just 20 runs for his five wickets.
Here’s a look at the wickets he claimed:

1.

Obanda, who came to open the batting alongside Karim was looking dangerous. He had already hit five fours in his innings and had occupied the crease for over an hour.

2.

With Basant Regmi piling up the pressure on the other end with a Maiden, Lamichhane claimed Gondaria’s wicket in the fourth ball of the 18th over. Having lost opener Obanda, Kenya were looking to keep the momentum going. But Sandeep had other ideas.

3.
In the first ball of the 33rd over, Lamichhane got RR Patel out caught by skipper Paras Khadka.

4.


The very next ball it was RN Patel’s turn. Patel could not judge Lamichhane’s spin and was plumb in front of the wicket. Two in two balls for Lamichhane.
5.


Sandeep was bowling his last ball for the match when he got rid of Odhiambo. He completed his spell with a fifer. The best figures by a Nepali bowler in List A cricket!",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/watch-sandeep-lamichhanes-fifer-against-kenya.html,sports
Nepal’s suspended cricket board drafting response to ICC threat,"Wednesday, December 20, 2017","
Kathmandu, December 20
The ‘elected’ group of the ICC-suspended Cricket Association of Nepal is preparing a response to an ultimatum issued by the world governing body to clarify how it meets the Council’s membership criteria.
General Secretary Ashok Nath Pyakurel is drafting the response and is preparing to send to the ICC ahead of the December 22 deadline.
This comes a few weeks after the ICC, in a letter to CAN, demanded that the Nepali board explain to it how it meets the international body’s membership criteria, by December 22. The ICC had also said that if CAN fails to submit a satisfactory response, it would be forced to cancel Nepal’s membership of the global body.
The ICC’s letter has been seen as a response to the decisions taken by the General Assembly, held on August 22. The assembly had endorsed a new statute for the association, prepared by the ICC-formed Nepal Advisory Committee. But the ICC was unhappy with the move as the assembly made some changes it does not approve, to the draft statute.
In his response to the ICC, Pyakurel is going to say that the statute endorsed by the General Assembly should form the basis of any future agreement. But, CAN is open to discussing issues the ICC wants to be addressed before the suspension can be lifted.
“In the case of ‘membership criteria’, we are already a member of the ICC, we have just been suspended and we are not seeking new membership. We will take all necessary administrative steps to comply with the membership criteria after the suspension is lifted,” Pyakuryal told Onlinekhabar.
According to sources, the ICC is preparing to send a delegation to Nepal after receiving CAN’s response. The delegation is likely to come to Kathmandu after the new government assumes power. The delegation will hold discussions with the stakeholders in Nepal and prepare recommendations for the ICC General Assembly, to be held in February.
The International Cricket Council suspended CAN’s membership in April 2015 citing government intervention in the administration of the sport. It formed an advisory committee to draft a statute for a new body that would replace CAN in October. The advisory committee’s recommendations were passed with some amendments by the General Assembly.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-suspended-cricket-board-drafting-response-to-icc-threat.html,sports

Ashes 2017: Why underdog status could do England’s cricket team a big favour,"Friday, November 17, 2017","

After being in the news for all the wrong reasons, England’s cricket team is in Australia preparing for the Ashes. The beleaguered squad is viewed by pretty much everyone as underdogs following the loss of star player Ben Stokes due to a disciplinary matter.
For fans in England or Australia – or pretty much anywhere else cricket is played for that matter – the Ashes is laden with significance. The contest dates back to 1882, when a touring team from the then colony of Australia beat England, prompting a satirical obituary “in affectionate remembrance” of English cricket in a British newspaper. Since then, Ashes tours have become for players and fans alike, a barometer of national pride for the two countries. And, at the moment at least, Australia is claiming bragging rights in expectation of giving England a good thrashing.
Given the recent examples of underdogs overcoming their limitations in other sports – Leicester City Football Club, for example, going from relegation fodder to English Premier League winners; Danny Willet winning the US Masters while ranked 102nd in the world, and the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first time in 108 years – it’s worth asking whether underdog status is good or bad for the English cricket team?
An underdog is defined as an individual or group that is at a disadvantage and expected to lose. So there are two intertwined elements to being an underdog that are worthy of further consideration. First, underdogs are those considered to be at a disadvantage compared to their opponent – whether it is because of fewer resources, a smaller reputation or, in the case of England’s Test team, the loss of a star player.
Second, underdog status can be achieved through lowered expectations and an anticipated loss. The lowering of expectations can often lead to commentators or pundits viewing the underdog in a positive light. Watching an underdog achieve can be a massive source of inspiration – after all, it is the uncertainty within sport that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Hence, underdog status may not be such a bad thing for the England players.
Team cohesion is often defined as the sum of the forces pushing in from the outside and the bonds within the group pulling it together – and, in Australia, it is likely that this push/pull effect could be maximised. Both on and off the field of play, the England players will be exposed to sledging – the verbal abuse usually directed at individual batsman by the majority of the fielding team.
How Queensland’s Courier-Mail greeted the England test team when they toured in 2013. England lost 5-0. Courier-Mail
In an Ashes series, probably the highest-profile cricket encounter globally, the sledging will be from players, crowd, pundits and probably the Australian media as a whole. However, if well prepared for, these external forces directed at the England players, could be used to pull the group together to form a very tight unit and even strengthen the team’s resolve: “The whole world is against us, but what doesn’t kill us, will only make us stronger.”
Another psychological concept that will loom large in the context of the Ashes, will be the home advantage. The phenomenon that the home team (in most aspects of sport) tends to have an advantage because of greater crowd support, a better working knowledge of the pitch, and the local facilities.
In most circumstances, these factors would lower the expectations of success for the away team but might increase expectations for the home side. Interestingly, the heightened expectations of the Australian players, among both the public and media, could work against them.
If, in the somewhat unlikely event that things go England’s way, these expectations could see the crowd and the pundits quickly turning on the Australian players, whereas conversely, the reduced expectation – and hence pressure – felt by the England players, may have a liberating effect.
The Ashes series will be the ultimate test of the England player’s mental toughness. The England Cricket team should expect adversity to come from every direction, the media will be “in their face” 24/7, the crowd will be constantly on their back and it is likely that every element that the Australian management can control will be used to test the resolve of the England players.
For instance, it is likely that the pitches will be prepared to favour the Australian team’s preferences and even the itinerary may have been constructed to give the England players little respite. If England players can produce match-winning performances under these circumstances, they will truly be mentally tough.
Recent indicators are not favourable. During England’s 5-0 drubbing in Australia in 2013/14, Jonathan Trott – who occupied the key batting position of number three for England – left the tour early for stress-related reasons having been hit by a delivery from Australia’s super-fast bowler Mitchell Johnson. The oft-trumpeted Australian tactic of “mental disintegration” – uncompromising cricket on the field and a constant barrage of abuse off the field – had helped to claim an important scalp.
However, with most aspects of preparation and the occasion being weighted in the Aussies favour, legendary status and a hero’s welcome home awaits a winning England team. If the underdog wins, the repercussions will rumble around “down-under” for a lifetime – Australian pundits still smart at the memory of the 1986/87 Ashes tour when a team from England that “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” returned home holding the Ashes urn. Given the hype in the Australian press this time around, an England win would be truly memorable.

FC Barcelona and the Catalan struggle for independence,"Wednesday, October 25, 2017","
FC Barcelona’s motto “mes que un club” or “more than a club” is emblazoned across the team’s website, splashed across the seats of its Nou Camp stadium and embroidered on the collars of first-team shirts.
The slogan dates back to the Catalan club’s formation in 1899, when a Swiss émigré founded what is now commonly referred to as “Barca”. Hans Max Gamper-Haessig, who was enthralled by Catalonia and would later change his name to Joan Gamper, established Barca as a membership club. Even today, these members pay an annual fee to become part of what many see as one of world football’s best-governed clubs.

From the outset, Barcelona has been a focal point for Catalan identity, as well as a symbol of democracy. So much so that in 1925 then Spanish prime minister, Primo de Rivera, accused Gamper and Barca of promoting Catalan nationalism. Later, during the Spanish Civil War, Nou Camp would become one of few places in the city where people could openly speak in Catalan.
It is therefore unsurprising that in recent weeks FC Barcelona has become central to the region’s independence vote. On Sunday, the day of the vote – which was declared illegal by Spain’s central government – Barca called for its league match against Las Palmas to be postponed, as violence spread across the city. When its request was denied, the club issued a last minute statement that condemned the attempts to stop citizens voting and said that the game would go ahead, but behind closed doors.
This match was, though, laden with meaning. Some criticised the club for selling out to television companies, putting money from broadcasting contracts ahead of political principles. Others observed that pressure has been placed on Barca by La Liga president Javier Tebas, a lifelong Real Madrid fan. He also gave permission for the Las Palmas team to play with a special Spanish flag (intended to symbolise Spanish unity) woven into their shirts.
One of the players on the field during the game was Barca’s talismanic defender, Gerard Piqué, who has publicly professed his support for the Catalonia independence vote. Piqué, recently booed by other Spanish fans, has even offered to quit playing for the country’s national team.

FC Barcelona is clearly, then, much more than a club. It is a complicated and highly politicised entity in a way the likes of Manchester United or Arsenal have never been. But herein lies an important challenge, which probably serves as a metaphor too for the many other challenges facing Catalonia – how to successfully navigate the future post-independence.
Top-level professional football is no longer just a local game for local people. It is a mass-market product traded by businesses for a commercial return. And Barca is no exception. A shirt sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways drew condemnation from fans for moving the club in a more commercial direction. Some cynics have even referred to Barca’s “Madridification”.
In this context, recent events pose significant challenges for Barca’s business dealings. For example, in the middle of Sunday’s events, the club issued a public statement asserting that it supported the right to Catalonian self-determination and condemned any act by the Spanish state that might impede its people’s democratic right to vote in the referendum.
As a philosophy – and as a brand proposition – this is both noble and distinctive. But for a club that has been casting covetous eyes at Asian markets, it could prove troublesome. The last thing the Qataris or Chinese will want is for fans and businesses in their countries to be building a relationship with a club that advocates separatism and a disregard for central government authority.
It will, therefore, be worthwhile keeping a close eye on messages coming out of Doha, Beijing and elsewhere in Asia. That said, given Catalan diasporas in Latin America – those that fled the region during the Spanish civil war – at least part of the club’s overseas commercial strategy targeting fans looks set to remain intact.
Speculation abounds as to what secession would mean for Barca, whether it could stay in Spain’s top flight (Tebas has said the club will not be allowed to remain in the league in the event of secession), and whether it would lose its UEFA membership and right to play Champions League football.
Some have even suggested that Barca could join England’s Premier League. Commercially, this might seem like a marriage made in heaven. But it is extremely unlikely to happen, not least because of the potential complexities of such a move. The other alternative – a small Catalonia league with the likes of local rivals Espanyol, Girona and Tarragona – is hard to imagine and would struggle to generate sizeable revenues.
Such a debate may sound premature. But it’s indicative of how the club has to consider its commercial, as well as political priorities. Gamper was right, FC Barcelona is more than a club. But football in 1899 was a rather different proposition to football in the 21st century. The power of Catalan politics might be compelling, but in football, the lure of global revenue streams may yet trump regional idealism.

WCL: Nepal relegated to Division 2 as match with Hong Kong cancelled,"Monday, October 16, 2017","Kathmandu, October 16
It has been certain that Nepal will be relegated to Division 2 as their match with Hong Kong under the ICC World Cricket League Championship cancelled owing to rains today.
The match was postponed for today from Sunday due to a tropical storm.
But, post-storm rains did not stop and the umpire announced that both the teams receive one point each.
Earlier, Nepal were defeated by Hong Kong by 83 runs in the first match played on Friday.
Hence, as Nepal earned just one point from the Hong Kong tour, they could not made it to top four teams among the Championship participants and were relegated to the Division Two.

Kathmandu, July 20
Nepal’s hopes of qualifying for the 2018 U-19 cricket World Cup have received a jolt after they suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Afghanistan.
After the completion of the first round of matches, Afghanistan top the table with big wins against Malaysia, Singapore and Nepal. Nepal are second with two wins. As only the top-finishing side qualify for the World Cup, Nepal would need a massive win against the Afghans to beat the rivals on run rate.

Nepal could only muster 49 runs before the Afghans sent all Nepali batsmen to the pavilion. Right-arm pacer Naveen-ul-Haq wreaked havoc, claiming three batsmen on the trot to complete his hat-trick.

The 28-year-old was a veteran of 11 successful mountain expeditions, including those to Everest, Manaslu, Kilimanjaro, Elbrus and Kosciuszko. On most of his expeditions, Pandit would put on the traditional Nepali daura surwal  and hold the national flag to pose for a photo. When news spread about his demise, on Sunday, the sports community in Nepal was shell-shocked as it lost one of its brightest stars.

Still can’t believe the news. Sanjay Pandit was a man with a strong will power and perseverance. A big loss for us. https://t.co/JB9Bbrj3hh

Pandit was born to an erudite family in the western hills of Nepal. He was no stranger to walking long distances. During his interviews, he often talked about his school days and his Principal dad. In one of his interviews, he said that his home was 40 kms away from his school, and his dad would insist that he and his brother make the journey every day, come rain or shine.
After his SLC, Pandit was sent to Kathmandu to continue his education. He did continue his education in the city, but Kathmandu was more about inspiration for the teenager. It was in Kathmandu that he heard the success stories of Rajendra Bhandari and Baikuntha Manandhar, and that made him take up running. In 2008, he took part in the first Kathmandu International Marathon. After that, he ran Kathmandu-Khasa, Kathmandu-Gorkha, Dang-Pyuthan route. In 2011, he ran from the Nepal-China border point in Tatopani to commemorate the Nepal Tourism Year.
But running was not enough for him, it did not give him the thrill he yearned for. He said that an interview of legendary climber Apa Sherpa he watched on TV made him take up mountaineering as well.
In 2012, he tried climbing Everest, but failed. He returned the next year, but had a close shave; his Sherpa guide died on the mountain. He ran out of oxygen, and was counting his minutes, when another climber who was returning to the base camp gave him extra oxygen he was carrying.
But that did not stop him. He decided to start a campaign to climb more mountains outside Nepal. Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa and Mt Elbrus, the highest in Europe, were easy pickings for the seasoned mountaineer. He then went to Australia to climb Mt Kosciuszko. He even made it to Antarctica.
When Pandit said he was going to climb Mt Denali, his friends and supporters felt it would be yet another ‘easy’ climb for the mountaineer, who has been to extreme places on Earth. But fate had it otherwise. According to local reports, Pandit died at around 5,000 metres while descending the mountain. Park spokeswoman Maureen Gualtieri said Pandit was heading down the popular West Buttress route of Denali when rangers received a request for help about 1 am local time.
“An independent party of three had been descending from Denali Pass when one of the teammates collapsed due to unknown illness,” Gualtieri wrote in a statement. “By the time the initial team of two (National Park Service) mountaineering volunteers reached the scene, the climber was unresponsive.”
If Pandit were alive, it was certain that many more records would tumble, and Nepal’s flag would flutter on top of more mountains. Pandit leaves behind an inspirational story for young Nepalis to persevere through hardship and to dream big.

Nepal advisory committee sends CAN’s draft statute to ICC despite Pyakuryal’s objection,"Wednesday, June 14, 2017","
Kathmandu, June 14
The advisory committee formed by the International Cricket Council to resolve the crisis in Nepali cricket has drafted a new statute for the Cricket Association of Nepal and sent it to the ICC.
A faction within the advisory committee, led by Ashok Nath Pyakuryal, however, has expressed reservations on some key issues including voting rights of district committees.
The charter proposes that CAN have a 17-member executive committee at the central level. The president and the secretary should have passed at least a Bachelor’s degree.
Likewise, each province and district will have 15-member and 13-member committees respectively. District committees have been proposed to exercise the right of distributing membership.
Meanwhile, Pyakuryal and some other members have opposed provisions of the charter endorsed by majority of the members and advisory committee coordinator Binay Raj Pandey. The dissident group is planning to write a letter to the ICC informing their disagreements.
Whereas the statute proposes that each two districts have one vote in the central general assembly, Pyakuryal faction wants every district to be given voting rights.
Likewise, they are at odds about rights of the Chatur Bahadur Chand-led elected body of CAN.
Pyakuryal says the Chand committee should also endorse the statute for implementation whereas Pandey argues the Chand-led team should not be given any right as it was suspended by the ICC.
The advisory committee was formed by the ICC in October 2016 with a mandate to suggest changes to CAN’s statute. It is supposed to submit its report in June 2017, just ahead of the global body’s annual conference in London (June 19-23).",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-advisory-committee-sends-cans-draft-statute-to-icc-despite-pyakuryals-objection.html,sports
"Army, Police share prize as rain obstructs PM’s Cup final","Thursday, June 8, 2017","Kathmandu, June 8
The Tribhuvan Army Club and the Nepal Police Club shared the prize of the first Prime Minister’s Cup cricket tournament as the rain obstructed the match halfway.
The Army were chasing the 127-run target posted by the Police when the rain started. Just two overs had been played and the Army had scored seven runs at the loss of a wicket.
Though the rain stopped after an hour, the umpire decided not to resume the game owing to damp pitch at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Stadium and share the title.
Consequently, both the departmental teams received rs 1.5 million each. Earlier, it was announced that the winners would get Rs 2 million and the runners-up would receive the half.
In the first innings, the Police had scored meagre 126 runs at the loss of all wickets in 45.1 overs.
Total eight teams, including three departmental and five regional, had participated in the tournament organised by the National Sports Council.

CAN dispute boils down to Pandey vs Pyakuryal,"Wednesday, May 31, 2017","
Kathmandu, May 31
Nearly 16 months after the escalation of a row over Nepal Cricket’s governing body’s leadership, the dispute has now boiled down to a clash of egos between former President Binay Raj Pandey and former General Secretary Ashoknath Pyakuryal.
Pandey and Pyakuryal, who are members of an advisory committee formed by the International Cricket Council with a mandate to suggest changes to CAN’s statute, are at odds over two key issues related to the rights of district-level associations.
The committee was formed by the ICC in October 2016; then Ministry of Sports Joint Secretary Chudamani Sharma, former CAN Vice-president Deepak Koirala, former skipper Pawan Agrawal, Sports Council’s Rohit Dahal and businessman Basant Chaudhary were named the other members. Pyakuryal and his associate Chatur Bahadur Chand were later added to the team. The ICC’s CEO David Richardson, who was in Kathmandu in September, had said that the committee will submit its report in June 2017, just ahead of the global body’s annual conference in London (June 19-23).
According to sources, while former skipper Agrawal has taken Pandey’s side, Sharma has been transferred and is no longer involved, Chaudhary has ‘lost interest’ in the proceedings and Koirala had been busy with local elections in his capacity as Kaski chief of CPN Maoist Centre. Dahal, meanwhile, has only shown interest in sending out a message that the National Sports Council is not responsible for the mess.
Pandey and Pyakuryal were close associates until December 2011. While Pandey was President of CAN’s ad-hoc body that had been running the association for over 70 years, Pyakuryal worked as General Secretary for some time. In December 2011, when the National Sports Council ordered the ad-hoc committee to conduct elections, Pyakuryal supported Maoist leader Tanka Anbuhang for President and filed his candidacy for General Secretary. Both Anbuhang and Pyakuryal won.
In June 2014, the anti-corruption body CIAA filed corruption charges against 10 board members, including Anbuhang and Pyakuryal saying that they had embezzled the association’s funds. With top officials under investigation, the association was being run by acting presidents, who could not perform their duties for lack of a mandate. It was during the same time that the players resorted to protests demanding a change in leadership in the association, and hike in their benefits.
During the last few weeks of their tenure in office, the 10 people were acquitted by the Special Court. Following the development, the UML, the ruling party, found an opportune moment to gain foot-hold in CAN, which was earlier under the ‘sphere of influence’ of the Maoists and the Nepali Congress.
The Maoists, including Anbuhang, also backed the UML, at the cost of Congress sympathisers, including general secretary Pyakuryal. The communist parties chose the National Sports Council as the agency to execute their design to ‘kick’ Congress out of CAN. But the main opposition Nepali Congress was in no mood to allow the ruling parties to take over the responsibility for one of the most popular sports in the country. Congress supporters within the association organised a general assembly and elected Congress leader Chatur Bahadur Chand as president.
The National Sports Council, which is a government body, did not recognise Chand’s election. Instead of taking the initiative to settle the differences between the Anbuhang and Chand groups, the NSC formed its own ad-hoc committee, with UML sympathiser Ramesh Siwlal as the board president. NSC Member Secretary Keshav Bista says the move was taken with the consent of the ICC. Pandey was watching all these from the sidelines.
Pandey, according to sources, believes that Pyakuryal brought politics into cricket and he is responsible for the mess the sport is in. Pyakuryal, meanwhile, believes Pandey wants to retain the leadership of the association and does not want to pass it on to the new generation. He says was not actively involved in cricket until the ICC suspended CAN last year citing ‘political interference’ and formed the advisory committee.
The thorny issues
Pyakuryal has demanded that every district body should have voting right at the central level. He has also demanded that the current leadership in the districts be retained until fresh elections are held. Pyakuryal believes that he has support in the districts and if the leadership there is retained, he will hold sway in the association.
However, Pandey has said no to the demands. He maintains that the moment the new staute is implemented, all district-level bodies will cease to exist. He also wants only a select districts to have voting rights at the central general assembly.
Issues that have been sorted so far
Both Pandey and Pyakuryal have agreed to form a new association, and to not transform CAN into a board. They have also agreed to have 17-18 members. Similarly, the provincial bodies are to have 15-17 people as executive members. The number for the districts shall be around 13-15. Only district bodies can distribute membership, and clubs that have played at least two tournaments will only be eligible for membership.
Representatives sent by the districts to the general assembly can file candidacy for President and General Secretary, but they will have to have a minimum level of educational qualification.
The way forward
Both Pandey and Pyakuryal have come to a conclusion that the dispute cannot be settled. They are preparing to send two sets of recommendations to the ICC soon. “We tried to reach a settlement, but we are nowhere near an agreement. We will send the recommendations in one-two weeks,” a member of the advisory committee told Onlinekhabar.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/can-dispute-boils-down-to-pandey-vs-pyakuryal.html,sports
How football clubs fail and succeed after reaching England’s Premier League,"Monday, May 22, 2017","Football always divides opinion. As the latest English season draws to a close and the Football League playoffs take centre stage, there will be some that grumble about the format. They will say how “unfair” it is that a club can finish third in the league in the regular season, yet be denied promotion by a club that finished sixth after a late surge. Set that aside though, and you are left with the pure drama. It is win or bust, and prolongs the excitement of the regular season, giving more teams, more to play for in a crescendo of late season fixtures.
The playoffs concept was borrowed from US team sports where this end-of-season competition is a regular feature, attracting huge media exposure and significant commercial interest. In England, for thirty years now, the playoffs have determined the final promotion spot within each division of the Football League. Four teams first try to get to the playoff final at Wembley stadium, then face a nerve-jangling 90 minutes or more to secure a step up the football pyramid.
The inspiration from US sports is important. Put aside the passion, excitement, disappointment and any sense of injustice for a moment. The playoffs can be of huge importance financially. A playoff victory can have the power to stabilise a club’s financial position, clear debts and allow significant investment in players. The pot of gold at the end of this rainbow has largely been filled with TV money. The most recent domestic deal was signed for £5.14 billion. Add in the international rights and this swells to £8.4 billion.
Lower down the leagues, the money on offer is not eye-watering. Our conservative estimates put the prize at around £500,000 for promotion from League Two to League One and around £7m for promotion from League One to the Championship. However, the prize on offer for promotion to the Premier League is staggering and has led to the Championship playoff final being labelled the “richest game in football” with a value of around £170m-£200m. Huddersfield, Reading, Fulham and Sheffield Wednesday are facing off for the jackpot this time around.
The often-quoted £200m figure is a little misleading as it takes into account so-called parachute payments which only kick in if a club is relegated the following season. Clubs will receive a minimum uplift of £120m though, which can be triple or quadruple their turnover. In fact, the chart below shows that when Bournemouth was promoted in 2015, the club saw a six-fold increase in revenue, essentially driven by additional broadcasting fees.
When the prize is so very shiny, straining to reach for it presents a strategic dilemma for clubs. The boost to revenue from promotion can stabilise a club financially, just like it did for Blackpool in 2010, helping it to (theoretically) secure a long-term future. In Blackpool’s case, however, on-field performance was destabilised and supporters became disenfranchised. Seven years later, Blackpool now hope to be promoted back to League One this season, via the playoffs.
Promotion can also increase the level of expectation and create pressure to retain a position in the world’s richest league. The club can get excited and the board can sanction acquisitions that fall outside a reasonable budget and seriously threaten the short and even long-term financial future of the club. This recalls the experience at Queens Park Rangers, which somehow accumulated £143m of losses despite generating about £250m in revenue during their stay in the Premier League. QPR managed to spend a startling £285m on wages and £114m on player purchases, while their level of debt surged to a peak of £194m.
The third option is to rein in your ambition, develop a strategic plan, grow incrementally and accept that you may become a yo-yo club like Burnley, or survive by the skin of your teeth like Stoke City.
Either way, the club builds a longer term future at the top table which benefits everyone. Survival through this approach means that a club receives at least another £120m so can build still further and become a stable Premiership club. But even failing and being relegated means a club will still have money to spend, receive a parachute payment (of another £45m or so) and spend a season in the Championship with turnover in excess of three times that of a standard team. This provides a significant competitive advantage over your rivals as Newcastle United showed this year – the Magpies spent big and gained promotion at the first attempt.
Ultimately, the direction of travel comes down to owner objectives, which can differ depending on their background and motivations. One thing that is clear: spending beyond your means does not always guarantee success.
The chart above allows us to examine a club’s transfer spending in the year following promotion. It is a confusing picture, but the red bars show those clubs which were relegated the following season, and demonstrate clearly that spending big is no guarantee of survival. This chart doesn’t show the starting point for each club in terms of player quality, but how you spend it is plainly crucial, and the chart shows too that you can survive without throwing the kitchen sink at player acquisitions.
There is broader evidence that the most successful clubs, with the most money, do tend to outperform, but the trade-off between financial and sporting performance is hazardous. Many clubs now choose to chase multiple and escalating objectives: recall the devastating failure at Leeds United in 2003, when creditors were owed almost £100m after the club chased the dream of playing in the Champions League. You chase that dream at your peril is the warning; plan carefully, and spend wisely is the advice to your board. Relegation doesn’t have to be a trapdoor, but promotion can be a trap.

Cricket: more Twenty20 may sow seeds of demise for the quintessential English game,"Tuesday, April 11, 2017","A city-based franchise competition of Twenty20, cricket’s shortest (20-over) format, is due to be launched in 2020 in a bid to give the English domestic game a financial boost. It is the latest plan from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) aimed at increasing the number of people watching the sport. The teams are expected to be based around well-known grounds such as Lord’s and the Oval in London, Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Old Trafford in Manchester and Headingley in Leeds.
Cricket’s audiences are thought to be ageing and may not be replenished. In other parts of the world, match-day attendances for the longer formats of the game, particularly international Test cricket over five days, have declined – although not in England.
Reception to the ECB’s franchise competition proposal has been mixed. Former England captain, Michael Vaughan, said he viewed Twenty20 as “the saviour” and predicted that it would have huge success in attracting new, younger fans. But he also warned that the new competition could eclipse other forms of the game, including international matches.
So, is the commercialisation of cricket a friend or foe to the game?
Cricket has been dealing with these tensions for longer than most sports have actually existed. Since its laws were first standardised and committed to paper in the mid-1700s, cricket has witnessed numerous incarnations in the name of progress and modernisation. Concerns about the economic model began in the 19th century, but the commercialisation of cricket in England experienced a step change in 1963 with the introduction of the first “one-day” competition, the Gillette Cup.
The shorter format became more frequent and more dominant, but various iterations were tried in the search for a commercially lucrative formula. Kerry Packer’s World Series Cricket in Australia in the 1970s, which saw players in coloured clothes (rather than the traditional whites) playing under floodlights with a white (not red) ball, would ultimately convince the market of cricket’s commercial potential.
The broadcast of one-day cricket enabled the game to become a “mediasport” – funded by and structured for media consumption – as our research has highlighted. Yet, despite considerable success, shorter variants continued to emerge, such as New Zealand’s Cricket Max in the late 1990s and Australia’s Super Eights.
But Twenty20, in which each team bats for 20 overs and the highest score wins, would become king. Ironically, given England’s role as the guardian of the traditions of cricket, Twenty20 was invented there in 2003.
Such was the immediate commercial success of Twenty20 that multiple domestic-based and internationally resonant competitions subsequently emerged: the Indian Premier League (IPL), Australian Big Bash, Bangladesh Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Super League currently exist. In the meantime, the English became victims of their own innovation. Their version, the T20 Blast, remained stuck in the traditional structures of county cricket and so lacked global appeal.
Enter the ECB’s new plan. The new city-based competition is set up for eight new teams – all owned by the ECB – with centrally-allocated pots of money for players and coaches. Each team will have a squad of 15 players, selected by draft. Teams will choose 13 players split across six salary bands and have two further wildcard picks – including a maximum of three overseas players to increase the tournament’s glamour. A play-off style system of 36 matches scheduled over 38 days will provide four home matches per franchise with eight matches shown live on free-to-air television.
Incomes should match those achieved by similarly global Twenty20 competitions. An annual IPL season in India, for example, generates more than double the gross income of a 50-over Cricket World Cup, which happens every four years.
Such innovations always have a wider social impact. It’s unclear how the addition of the planned franchise competition will affect the existing one-day county and T20 Blast competitions, which will continue to run. International Test matches will also be scheduled alongside the new competition, so which will draw England’s best players: cheque book or country?
Beyond logistics, there lies a more fundamental question. Twenty20 has become emblematic of the mediatisation and commercialisation of the game. While all sports have adapted to suit the needs of television and sponsors, the extent to which cricket has changed in the last 50 years is unprecedented. And yet, while Twenty20 incorporates the game’s fundamental elements – it is still contested between 11 men or women on a 22-yard strip of grass involving bat and ball – there remains much more room for innovation with the format. For instance, why insist on teams having five bowlers or limiting them to bowling 24 balls each?
The truth is that cricket is paradoxically innovative, yet conservative. The “inventors” of one-day cricket wanted it to look like the “real” thing – keen that short-term commercial goals should not betray the game’s inheritance. The English traditions epitomised by the longer form of Test match and county cricket are what make the game stand apart from other sports in the global marketplace. As a result, the commercial and media opportunities made possible by Twenty20 also bring with them a series of threats.
Each new iteration of cricket contains unresolved tensions. City-based Twenty20 will attract a new, younger audience, but perhaps they will be attracted for different reasons. Twenty20 packs stadiums drawn by cricket’s global superstars, but there is little evidence that it has the capacity to sustain audiences across the sport’s longer formats. You cannot breathe economic life into Test cricket by selling the audience something else so, at best, these latest plans create the need for further tinkering and, at worst, plant the seeds of Test cricket’s future demise.

How Arsene Wenger changed the Premier League … and then dropped the ball,"Friday, April 7, 2017","
When Arsene Wenger was named as the new manager of Arsenal FC in September 1996, English football was in a period of transition. The 1989 Hillsborough disaster had led to a transformation of the grounds and treatment of supporters, and the arrival of the Sky Sports TV channel heralded the formation of the Premier League in the 1992-93 season.
At pitch level however, the game remained the same. Tactics, pre-match preparation, training methods, were all largely unchanged. When Wenger got his job at Arsenal, he was only the third foreign manager to take charge of a Premier League team. His background (a degree in economics), modest playing experience and bookish appearance seemed completely at odds with the environment that existed at Arsenal at the time. This was an environment best understood by the title of the then captain’s autobiography. Former central defender Tony Adams called his memoir “Addicted”. But Arsenal were by no means the only club with an ingrained drinking culture during this period.

Like any great leader, however, Wenger could see into the future. In his first ten years at Arsenal he completely changed the philosophy of the game and achieved great success. But then he took his eyes off the ball. He missed the next set of big changes that forged how the Premier League evolved.
In the beginning Wenger’s tactics were considered to be ahead of their time, and thoughtful. His nickname, “the professor” reflected this. Part of his original approach was to focus on more than just match day. The “non-visible” preparation of his squad ranged from improving the food menu the players ate, to adjusting training methods to place more emphasis on ball control.
It seems strange now to think that these adjustments were in any way revolutionary, but at the time his methods were met with resistance by the players. Now many of them credit Wenger with extending their careers by a number of years.
A second key initiative was his ability to call on a network of scouts to help spot talented and undervalued players – especially from France. This brought him influential and talented footballers like Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry. He also used statistical data when purchasing players. This was not a new sporting tactic (think of the film Moneyball and what the Oakland A’s achieved in baseball by using statistical analysis). But it was one of the first proper applications of it to English football. Clubs now employ full-time statisticians and the data being collected has created a new industry in offering analysis of it.
The success of this new strategy was almost immediate. Wenger was the first foreign manager to achieve the league and cup double in 1998, and then repeated this feat in 2002. Arsenal won the FA Cup in 2003 and 2005, and in the 2003-04 season, the team went unbeaten in the Premier League. (This was only the second time this has been achieved. Preston North End had become the first “invincibles” in the inaugural season of the Football League in 1888-89.)
It was also the way in which Arsenal played that made this incredible achievement really stand out. Before Wenger arrived, the chant, “One-nil to the Arsenal”, reflected their focus on defence. The trophies won under their new manager saw a reinvention – a new focus on attack and playing the game with flair.



After this, change again swept through the English game in the form of huge amounts of overseas money. The business of football had altered, and Arsenal and Wenger were slow to react. The fact that they also had to fund a huge new stadium also complicated issues. Across London, Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and over the next decade, loaned the club just over £1 billion. The result? Some of the world’s best (and most expensive) players, and no fewer than 15 major trophies – including the ultimate prize, the Champions League trophy.
Wenger first saw the influx of foreign money as a short-term phenomenon and wanted to ensure that Arsenal had a sound financial basis rather than run the risk of overspending and bringing the club down. The result of this was in complete contrast to Chelsea. Between 2005 and 2014, Arsenal had a great new stadium, sound finances – and no major trophies.
The club is now playing catch up. Since 2013 their spend on new players of £197m has only been exceeded by Manchester United and City. As a consequence, their runners-up spot in the Premier League of 2015-16 was still considered disappointing, together with the increasingly familiar exit at Champions League quarter-final stage. With so much at financial stake now a top four finish is a must.
After yet another early exit from the Champions Leagues (a particularly embarrassing 10-2 aggregate defeat to Bayern Munich), the calls for Wenger to go are getting louder every week.
But Arsenal fans should be careful what they wish for. They owe Wenger plenty of gratitude for transforming the club. Yet rivals with deeper pockets have taken English football to the next level. Wenger’s background in economics will mean he knows that debt can bring quick results but risks long term damage.
With future TV deals expected to bring even more money into the game Arsenal must decide what model they want to follow. Should they gamble on the long term growth of TV revenues and spend big? Or do they continue to live within their current means? If Wenger does leave, Arsenal may need a new professor to explain what happens next.

Resolution to CAN dispute unlikely ahead of key ICC meeting,"Wednesday, April 5, 2017","Kathmandu, April 5
The dispute over Nepal’s cricket governing body is unlikely to be resolved before the ICC’s crucial meeting slated for June.
Members of the ICC Nepal Advisory Group are bickering over the transitional mechanism that will conduct fresh elections and run the game before the elected officials take over, sources say.
According to them, the advisory committee, which has been assigned to work on CAN’s statute by June-July 2017, is discussing a draft statute prepared by a group of lawyers. The draft proposes that the advisory group itself be transformed into an ad-hoc committee to administer the game before elected office bearers start work. But the committee is divided over the proposal.

CAN, Nepal’s main cricket body, was being run by ad-hoc committees for a long time before it got its elected leadership for the first time in its history in December 2011. Tanka Anbuhang, a Maoist leader, was elected unopposed as president of the board, and Ashok Nath Pyakurel the general secretary. In June 2014, the country’s anti-corruption body CIAA filed corruption charges against 10 board members, including the president and general secretary saying that they had embezzled the association’s funds.
With top officials under investigation, the association was being run by acting presidents, who could not perform their duties for lack of a mandate. During the last few weeks (November 5, 2015) of their tenure in office, the 10 officials were acquitted by the Special Court. Following the development, the UML, the ruling party, found an opportune moment to gain foot-hold in CAN, which was earlier under the ‘sphere of influence’ of the Maoists and the Nepali Congress.
But the then main opposition Nepali Congress was in no mood to allow the ruling parties to take over the responsibility for one of the most popular sports in the country. Congress supporters within the association organised a general assembly, and elected Congress leader Chatur Bahadur Chand as president.
The National Sports Council, which is a government body, did not recognise Chand’s election. Instead of taking the initiative to settle the differences between the Anbuhang and Chand groups, the NSC formed its own ad-hoc committee, with UML sympathiser Ramesh Siwlal as the board president.
The tussle between the ad-hoc committee led by the Ramesh Silwal and the the ‘elected committee’ led by Chand also reached the court. That was when the ICC said its patience was wearing thin, and in a matter of few days, CAN was suspended.
The International Cricket Council named businessman Basant Chaudhary and former cricket administrator Binay Raj Pandey as coordinators of its advisory committee for Nepal. Chand and his associate Ashok Nath Pyakurel were later inducted to the committee.


The Chatur Bahadur Chand group (the ‘elected’ CAN) has rejected the proposal that the advisory group be transformed into an interim body. It has, instead, demanded that it be recognised as the ad-hoc group. “There are some who want to transform the advisory group into an ad-hoc group. But that is not possible,” a member of the elected CAN told Onlinekhabar. The member said that when the new statute is ready a general assembly of the association, which had earlier elected Chand as president, has to endorse it.
The ICC’s annual meeting is scheduled to convene in June, and the global body wants the CAN dispute to be resolved before the meet. It wants the suspension to be lifted by the meeting. But that looks highly unlikely as advisory committee members run down the clock.
Another member of the committee said a decision on the transitional administration mechanism could be reached through a vote. But that will at least take some time to happen.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/resolution-to-can-dispute-unlikely-ahead-of-key-icc-meeting.html,sports
How football’s richest clubs fail to pay staff real living wage,"Monday, April 3, 2017","
English football’s top flight, the Premier League, dominates the sporting world’s league tables for revenue. Star players, managers and executives command lucrative wages. Thanks to the biggest TV deal in world football, the 20 Premier League clubs share £10.4 billion between them.
But this wealth bonanza is not being distributed fairly within clubs. Wages are dramatically lower for staff at the opposite end of the Premier League labour market to players and executives. Many encounter in-work poverty.
Indeed, Everton and Chelsea are the only two Premiership clubs fully accredited with the Living Wage Foundation to pay all lower-paid directly employed staff, as well as external contractors and agency staff, a real living wage. This is a (voluntary) wage that is higher than the legally required national living wage. It is calculated based on what employees and their families need to live, reflecting real rises in living costs. In London it’s £9.75 an hour, elsewhere it’s £8.45.

Of 92 clubs in England and Scotland’s football leagues, only three others – Luton Town, Derby County and Hearts – are also accredited with the Living Wage Foundation. And many club staff – cleaners, caterers, stewards and other match-day roles – are employed indirectly by agencies or contractors and not paid the real living wage.
In 2015, The Independent newspaper asked 20 Premier League clubs simple questions: Does your club pay the living wage to full-time staff? Does it pay, or is it committed to paying the living wage to part-time and contracted staff? Seven clubs failed to reply or said “no comment”.
Many football clubs are embedded in urban communities, some classified as among the most impoverished places in Western Europe. What does it say about ethics and employment practices, especially of wealthier Premier League clubs, when many match-day staff don’t receive a proper living wage?
Aside from moral factors relating to fairer distribution of wealth as the glue underpinning more equal societies, there is also a good business case for companies to pay a real living wage. According to the Living Wage Foundation, organisations among the 2,900 accredited as paying the voluntary living wage report significant improvements in quality of work, lower staff absence and turnover – and an improved corporate reputation as a result.
Everton FC, located in an area of Liverpool with high social deprivation, has announced that becoming an accredited Living Wage Foundation employer will significantly increase wages for contractors and casual, match-day staff. Denise Barrett-Baxendale, the club’s deputy chief executive, has said: “Supporting the accredited living wage is quite simply the right thing to do; it improves our employees’ quality of life but also benefits our business and society as a whole.” Everton’s neighbours Liverpool FC has yet to make a similar commitment.
Independent academic research suggests that while workers benefit from the real living wage, it’s not an automatic fix. Higher hourly pay does not necessarily translate into a better standard of living if working hours are too low. The problem is that there are large concentrations of part-time living wage jobs with few hours and so small income increases are offset by rising costs of living.
There has recently been growing mobilisation among the public, civil society, supporters groups and some politicians to pressure football clubs to pay the real living wage. The GMB, a big general workers union, launched the GMB End Foul Pay campaign. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, recently urged every London Premier League club to pay all staff the London living wage.
In Manchester, living wage campaigners have targeted the city’s two big clubs Manchester City and Manchester United. While progress has been reported at Manchester City, Manchester United has yet to commit to extending the living wage to its directly employed part-time match-day staff. By contrast, FC United of Manchester, the breakaway non-league club formed by Manchester United fans disenchanted with the Glazers’ ownership, pays the real living wage to all staff, setting an example to the much richer football giant. Manchester United presently ranks as the “richest club in the world”, having achieved record-breaking revenues of £515.3m in 2015-16.But despite these grassroots campaigns and political exhortations, few football clubs are taking concrete measures to improve the wages and working conditions of lower-paid staff. It appears that leaving pay determination to the prerogative of club owners and executives is not working. Stronger regulation and political intervention may have to be contemplated – such as raising the legal national living wage and giving better legal rights and protections to indirectly employed staff on precarious contracts.

Such issues clearly go beyond football clubs in an economy that still hasn’t recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. The state of the UK labour market is currently being considered by the government’s review of modern employment practices, but we can expect little to change when the economic model remains fundamentally the same.
The misguided political ideology of self-regulating market forces has created stark inequalities as wealth continues to trickle up disproportionately to the top 1% and countervailing institutions, particularly trade unions, have been emasculated. Low pay in football clubs and elsewhere reflects this broader systemic context of contemporary capitalism.

Adrenaline zen: what we can learn from extreme sports,"Sunday, March 26, 2017","BASE jumping, wingsuit flying, big wave surfing, extreme skiing and solo rope-free climbing, when we think of someone who takes part in these extreme activities, we think of a risk-taker. The type of person you might describe as a “deviant hedonist” or a “sensation-seeker”, who is looking for an “adrenaline rush”. And they are most likely to be young and male.
The problem with this stereotype of extreme sport participants, is that not only does it not always ring true, but it also means that extreme sports then become viewed in a way that makes them inaccessible to “normal people”.
This view can be extremely damaging, especially given evidence – which emerged when I was researching a book on the subject – shows that extreme sports might actually be more accessible and have more of a positive impact than traditional, competitive sports.
Interviews I conducted with people between the ages of 30 and 70 who participate in extreme sports suggested they can help to create profound and positive life changes – both in the short term and longer term. So instead of just the fast-paced experiences often portrayed in short videos of extreme sports, in reality, participants describe a feeling of peace and tranquillity during the experience that reflects something similar to mindfulness.
Over the long term, these experiences support sustained well-being benefits including the realisation that emotions, such as fear, that are traditionally considered negative, do not have to constrain one’s potential.
Do extreme sport lovers have something in common with meditation masters? Pexels.
These reflections can often change people’s everyday lives – they described no longer “being bored with life” and talked of having a “passion” for their sport. They also reported seeing other people and the planet in a much more positive way after taking up extreme sports.
Participants from all sorts of extreme sports often describe extraordinary sensory experiences of the sort not usually available in everyday life. This is because during participation in an extreme sport, a person’s ability to see, hear, and feel are all enhanced.
BASE jumpers, for example, talk about an enhanced capacity to see every nook and cranny, shade and colour of the rock even though they are travelling at 200 mph. Participants also describe an experience that feels like they are merging with the environment which invariably turns into a feeling of being profoundly part of nature.
This may be one reason why so many extreme sports athletes spend a great deal of energy and time working hard to educate and protect the natural environment – this glimpse into human potential acts as a learning opportunity for psychological health and well-being more generally.
But of course when taking part in these types of activities a mismanaged mistake or accident can result in death. Perhaps this is why nonparticipants find it hard to understand why anyone would willingly undertake extreme sports – unless there is something “not normal” about “those types of people”.
But this death risk is a large part of why participation in extreme sports requires considerable commitment, along with a great deal of hard work. Extreme sports are not for those interested in the quick rush, thrills or hedonism. In fact, people interested in the short-term hedonistic outcomes might be better finding another outlet. Participants in extreme sport have to have an incredible understanding of the environment that they participate in and if the conditions are not right – such as the wind in the wrong direction for BASE jumping – then they will walk away.
How extreme sports can invoke meditative states. Pexels.
Extreme sports participants also possess a well-tuned knowledge of their own physical and psychological capacities and limitations. This is vitally important, because extreme sports are not the place to find out if you can or can’t undertake an activity.
BASE jumpers do not start as BASE jumpers, just the same as big wave surfers slowly develop the skills. And solo rope-free climbers start with ropes on less difficult terrain. In most cases, the journey to extreme sports is often one of deliberate skill and knowledge development.
It is clear from my own research, that extreme sports have the capacity to shine a light on what it means to be human – and what human beings are capable of. But to realise this, as a society we need a cultural shift that accepts extreme sports as beneficial. Along with a change in view that recognises extreme sports participants as examples of what is possible in human performance.
Good for your body and mind. Shutterstock
But before you go out and find your latest BASE jumping club, the good news is that many of these benefits can be touched on through adventure sports more generally. This includes activities such as climbing, kayaking and mountaineering. Adventure sports do not have the downside of being constrained by tightly controlled fields as in football or cricket. And they are not focused on competition, winning and losing.
These sports are open to all and, like extreme sports, could help to encourage participation in physical activity – along with a great sense of well-being, and a deeper relationship with the natural environment. And if all of this can be achieved at the same time as having fun on the water, a rock-face or up a mountain, what’s not to like?

[Nepal Vs Kenya] Collins Obuya: From ‘Sandeep Lamichhane’ to ‘Kumar Sangakara’,"Monday, March 6, 2017","
On February 23, 2003, cricket lovers from around the world were talking about one Kenyan cricketer. The young lad who was about to complete high school had left who’s who batsmen of international cricket clueless. That day he’d created history.
During the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup, Kenya hosted Sri Lanka for one of the Group ‘B’ matches. Under legendary batsman Sanath Jayasurya, Sri Lanka were one of the favourites to win the cup. The South Asian side had already run over a New Zealand side led by the formidable Stephen Fleming, crushed Bangladesh and muzzled Canada.
On a bright summer day in Nairobi, the Lankans wanted to wrap up the match quickly and go back to the hotel for a relaxed dip in the pool. That was why the Jayasurya, who won the toss, invited Kenya to bat first.
The Lankan bowlers were brimming with confidence. It was just nine days ago that Chaminda Vaas rattled the Bangladeshi batting order, claiming a wicket on the very first ball. He had taken four wickets in the over, after completing a hat-trick. Spin wizard Murlitharan, who haunted the best of batsmen in their worst nightmares, was also in his prime form. But the result at the end was something neither Vaas nor Murlitharan would have imagined.
The home side put up a resilient effort and their batsmen occupied the crease for over 207 minutes. They played the 50 overs allotted to them and put up 210 runs on the board. The Kenyan Skipper Keneddy Obuya was the highest run-getter for the squad. On any other day, Keneddy would have received a hero’s welcome after the match, but the real hero of the match would be another Obuya, his brother Collins.
When Sri Lanka came to bat, it was Collins Obuya who stole the show. The leggie, in an instant, became the instant favourite of aspiring leg-spinners around the world who had until then idolised the Aussie wizard Shane Warne, banned from cricket just a few days before the World Cup for using steroids.
The young Obuyas’ first victim was Hashan Tilakratne. Then it was Jaywardane to walk the long walk as Obuya got him out ‘caught and bowled’. Sangakara, one of the most formidable batsmen against spin, was out caught behind the wicket by the senior Obuya off the younger Obuya. Arvinda De Silva, one of the heroes of the Lankan World Cup victory in 1996 was shell-shocked when he was out caught behind.

But it was not just De Silva who would be shell-shocked by the end of the match. After the wicket of bowling all-rounder Chaminda Vaas fell, again courtesy Collins Obuya, Kenya had pretty much wrapped up the match. The visiting side lasted for just 185 minutes and all of its batsmen were back in the pavilion for 157 runs. Collins Obuya took five wickets, and was the obvious man of the match.
Following a explosion in Mombasa, one of the biggest cities in Kenya, New Zealand, one of the teams in Group B decided not to play in Nairobi. The Black Caps forfeited the match to the African side without a ball being bowled. Kenya’s fairy-tale run was ended by India in the semi-finals.
Thirty-five-year-old Collins Obuya, who reached the height of his success in 2003 is coming to Kathmandu on Thursday as part of the Kenyan team to play two World Cricket League matches against Nepal. But cricket lovers will not have the pleasure of seeing him bowl. In fact, Obuya, who kept the best of batsmen guessing with his bowling, is not even going to bowl.

Here’s why. After the 2003 World Cup, Obuya when to England to play for Warwickshire. Unfortunately, he could not continue is good form there. Although he made a fifty in his debut match, and played six T20 matches, he failed to impress. He missed the 2004 Champions Trophy due to appendicitis.
Following a dispute in Kenyan cricket, Obuya could not play a lot of matches, and by 2005 he couldn’t even pitch a single ball. In November the same year, he travelled to Australia to work on his bowling, but in vain.
Obuya did not lose hope. He wanted to play cricket, and that meant he had to transform himself into a batsman. His transformation was complete by 2011 when he scored an unbeaten 98 against the mighty Aussies in a World Cup match. The same year, he was appointed captain of the squad for a brief period.
Obuya, however, has failed to impress with the bat in the World Cricket League. His best score so far has been 38 against PNG, and barring a 36 against the UAE and a 32 against Namibia, he hasn’t been able to cross the 20-run mark. Last Saturday, however, he scored a half-century against Baroda U-23 in Gujarat, but could not save his side from a defeat.
Obuya was also part of the team that played Nepal in the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in 2013. Fans remember him as the batsman who hit Basant Regmi for a big six, although those were the only runs that came from his bat during the match.
On Saturday, when Obuya face’s Nepal’s leggie prodigy Sandeep Lamichhane, he will perhaps remember his good old days when he turned the ball like no one else. Will Obuya hit him for six, or will Sandeep turn the tables on Obuya, and treat him the way he treated Sangakara? We’ll have to wait a few hours to know.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/collins-obuya-sandeep-lamichhane-kumar-sangakara.html,sports
ICC: Nepal can be re-admitted as early as June 2017,"Monday, February 20, 2017","
Kathmandu, February 20
The International Cricket Council (ICC) says Nepal’s board could be re-admitted to the world governing body as early as June, over a year after it suspended CAN citing political interference in the administration of the sport.
The ICC, in its statement on Monday, also said its delegation visited Nepal this week to consult with the cricket community. “A series of positive meetings of the Nepal Advisory Group concluded this weekend in Kathmandu as part of the process to re-admit the Cricket Association of Nepal as a member of the International Cricket Council,” it said in a statement.
The statement is a reiteration of ICC CEO David Richardson’s comments when he visited Nepal in last year. He had also said that he would like to see Nepal re-admitted to the world body by June 2017.
The global body also says a delegation will return to Kathmandu around the time the World Cricket League Championship matches against Kenya (March 11-13).  The ICC will then decide on a timetable for the adoption of the revised Constitution and subsequent elections. Following this, Nepal’s membership of the ICC will be tabled for consideration at the ICC Annual General Meeting in June.
“Following this, Nepal’s membership of the ICC will be tabled for consideration at the ICC Annual General Meeting in June,” says the statement.
Meanwhile, the ICC has also agreed to induct Chatur Bahadur Chand and Ashoknath Pyakurel, members of the ‘elected’ CAN into the advisory group, which will now have eight members. However, the ICC has stayed mum on this.
CAN, Nepal’s main cricket body, was being run by ad-hoc committees for a long time before it got its elected leadership for the first time in its history in December 2011.
Tanka Anbuhang, who has no qualms about being a Maoist leader, was elected unopposed as president of the board, and Ashok Nath Pyakurel the general secretary. In June 2014, the country’s anti-corruption body CIAA filed corruption charges against 10 board members, including the president and general secretary saying that they had embezzled the association’s funds.

During the last few weeks (November 5, 2015) of their tenure in office, the 10 officials were acquitted by the Special Court. Following the development, the UML, the ruling party, found an opportune moment to gain foot hold in CAN, which was earlier under the ‘sphere of influence’ of the Maoists and the Nepali Congress.
The Maoists, including Anbuhang, also backed the UML, at the cost of Congress sympathisers, including general secretary Pyakurel. The communist parties chose the National Sports Council as the agency to execute their design to ‘kick’ Congress out of CAN.
But the then main opposition Nepali Congress was in no mood to allow the ruling parties to take over the responsibility for one of the most popular sports in the country. Congress supporters within the association organised a general assembly, and elected Congress leader Chatur Bahadur Chand as president.
The National Sports Council, which is a government body, did not recognise Chand’s election. Instead of taking the initiative to settle the differences between the Anbuhang and Chand groups, the NSC formed its own ad-hoc committee, with UML sympathiser Ramesh Siwlal as the board president. NSC Member Secretary Keshav Bista says the move was taken with the consent of the ICC.
The tussle between the ad-hoc committee led by the Ramesh Silwal and the the ‘elected committee’ led by Chand also reached the court. That was when the ICC said its patience was wearing thin, and in a matter of few days, CAN was suspended.
The International Cricket Council has already named businessman Basant Chaudhary and former cricket administrator Binay Raj Pandey as coordinators of its advisory committee for Nepal. The names of Chaudhary and Pandey were finalised after a two-member delegation of the ICC comprising Chairman of Associates Imran Khwaja and ICC finance officer Ammar Sheikh held talks with stakeholders of the game in Nepal in November 2016.
The advisory committee has been given a July 2017 deadline to review the statute of Cricket Association of Nepal, and to suggest amendments to it to pave the way for elections. According to sources, an informal understanding has been reached to allow Chaudhary to coordinate the committee’s activities with the government and Pandey to look into the statute and the structure of CAN. Committee general secretary Pawan Agrawal has been given the authority to convene the committee.
The ICC has already declined a request by the committee members to allow the panel to function as Nepal’s cricketing body until elections are held. Committee member Deepak Koirala says the panel has been given a deadline of June 27 to finish its work.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/icc-nepal-can-re-admitted-early-june-2017.html,sports
Can European football compete against China?,"Sunday, January 29, 2017","Most observers would agree that club football, in particular the Premier League, is enjoying a golden age of prosperity and popularity. Football in the UK, and Europe more widely, has arguably never been more successful than over the past decade. Clubs use their stadia, players, coaches, and the collective reputation of their league to develop and leverage the equity of their “brand” and the resultant commercial opportunities have been fully exploited through lucrative television deals and sponsorship contracts.
The Premier League has had little past competition in terms of attracting and keeping its star players. Spain’s La Liga, spearheaded by Real Madrid and Barcelona, is perhaps its closest commercial rival having tempted the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, and Luis Suarez in the past. But there is a cloud on the horizon for Europe’s footballing elite. The January transfer window may have offered us a glimpse of the future, with reports of Chelsea’s Diego Costa being tempted by a big money move to China.

In 2012 Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua lured former Premier League stars Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba to the Chinese Super League (CSL). Internationally, the deals attracted the usual passing glance but nothing too inquisitive. The general “Western view” was that this was just another example of a developing football nation spending money on players soon to be retired – nothing more than a PR stunt.
At the same time President Xi Jinping made it clear that football was now (almost) top of the Chinese political agenda. China’s strategy is two-fold; first a state modified grassroots campaign that is anything but organic, starting with the development of a target 50,000 football schools to boost Chinese footballing talent.
Second, more relaxed public sector restrictions and encouragement for market innovation has led to China’s business moguls to re-position and extend what they do in business to support their leader’s footballing ambitions. This example of “political guanxi” allows for the lines between private and public sector networks to merge creating significant market opportunity. Activities include local market investment, and overseas acquisitions – Chinese firms spent lavishly on investment throughout 2015 and 2016 in the purchasing of European football clubs. The signal of intent is clear, but surely they are still no match for the mighty Premier League?


Player acquisitions are important in football on and off the pitch. They bring with them global fan bases, TV spectatorship, online activity and digital exposure. While deals to bring Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba were reminiscent of strategies from other emerging football markets – such as Major League Soccer (MLS) in America – subsequent transfers between 2013 and 2015, bringing the likes of Tim Cahill, Asamoah Gyan, Obafemi Martins, and Demba Ba to the CSL showed that China could, through mostly financial incentives, attract a reasonable quality of foreign players.
The bar however was soon to be raised. In January 2016 China cracked the luxury end of the football market. Athletico Madrid star Jackson Martinez, despite interest from Arsenal, swapped La Liga for the Middle Kingdom, arguably at the peak of his game. Alex Teixeira, hot on Liverpool’s radar, snubbed England in favour of China. Ramires left Chelsea for China despite a regular first team role at Stamford Bridge. China was starting to flex its financial muscle, and Chinese business quickly jumped on board.


The January 2017 window (so far), goes a step further. Former Manchester City, and Juventus striker Carlos Tevez earns a reported £615,000 per week playing in China. While Tevez could be considered as past his best, Chelsea star Oscar has arguably traded London for Shanghai before reaching his peak as a player.
These deals were sandwiched between rumours of hundred million-pound offers for Cristiano Ronaldo, and strong recent interest in Chelsea star Diego Costa. These are the fine wines of world football, the household names that drive Europe’s commercial supremacy. Yet now they are starting to turn the wheels of China’s latest industrial revolution. In a market of potentially hundreds of millions of football consumers, a burgeoning middle class with sizeable spending power, a move to China naturally boosts the potential of more lucrative sponsorship deals and greater media exposure. And so the cycle intensifies.


There is no doubt that the Premier League helped drive the commercialisation of football in Europe. China is trying to do the same, but rather than creating star attributes, it is buying them.
The implications of China’s growing commercial strength for the rest of the world stretch beyond mere competition and commercial muscle in football. Whether or not contracts and transfer fees can be matched in the West, the question is – should they be? Market inflation and a widening wealth gap within the global football market are just some of the short-term consequences. The longer-term opportunity costs in other sectors could be far more serious. If English and European football clubs want to continue enjoying the premier position they hold in world football, its time to start reshaping the market in which they operate, before the market begins to reshape them.

"For Nepal, future of women’s football is brigther than men’s: Coach Kumar Thapa","Wednesday, January 18, 2017","
Kumar Thapa debuted for Nepal’s national team in 1998 and played for the squad for five years before he decided to quit due to a spat with then ANFA boss Ganesh Thapa.
Thapa, who recently passed his grade ‘A’ coaching exam, returned to the national scene recently, after 15 years, after he was appointed head coach of the women’s team, ahead of the South Asian Football Federation Women’s. The former midfielder had said the only team that posed a challenge to Nepal was India. Ever since the SAFF women’s tournament began in 2010, India is the only team Nepal has not defeated, not even once.
Thapa was optimistic that his side would beat India this time, but the South Asian giants thrashed Nepal 3-1 in the semi-final and went on to win the title. Onlinekhabar recently talked to Thapa about his experience coaching the national team. Excerpts from an interview:
How was Nepal’s journey to the semi-final?
During the group stage of the tournament, all matches we played were one-sided. Our defenders and goalie were hardly troubled. I knew that when we play India, all that was going to change. So even when our defenders were not challenged, I had instructed the girls to play as much as possible on our part of the ground.
Could you describe to us the semi-final match against India?
We expected to meet India in the final, but they played a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh in the group stage, and finished the first round as runners up in the group. As winners of our group, we had to play the runners up, and that is how we had to face India earlier than expected.
I remember clearly that our team was playing good football during the first half of the match. I think both sides made 2-3 attempts at the post in the first half. We had better possession of the ball and we could have scored. Things were going according to plan.
We should understand that if the opposition scores withing the first 10 minutes of the game, it is difficult for any women’s team to make a come-back. My experience tells me, that if a woman’s side concedes in the first 10 minutes, the opposition scores at least 5-6 goals.
We were fortunate that we did not concede in the first 10 minutes of the match. But India scored in the dying moments of the first half. What cost us the most was that our midfielders are not very tall. They played long balls, and India took advantage of this. We conceded the first goal in a counter-attack.
During the break, I told the players to play their natural game. I knew that a 1-0 scoreline is the same as a 5-0 scoreline in terms of win and loss. So I decided to be more aggressive, and added one more striker to the squad. During the first half, we had adopted he 4-2-3-1 formation while in the second half we went of a 5-3-2. We even managed to equalise with a change in strategy.
Then what happened? Was the referee’s booking of Sabitra Bhandrai affect the outcome of the match?
Our main striker Sabitra, who is more of a physical player, was handed a yellow card early in the first half of the match. An Indian player had tackled from behind, that too inside the box, but Sabitra was penalised. I believe she was then under mental pressure to not to get another yellow. This has a telling effect on a player like her.
So, what happened was that by the 75th minute, we had equalised. In the 82nd minute, India capitalised on a corner, and I realised that the tournament was over for Nepal.
Do you think the players could not adjust to the new strategy you adopted in the second half?
I would have to concede that I could not properly explain my strategy to the girls. It was also because they are used to playing under the traditional formation, and it is hard for them to think beyond that.
Why do we always lose to India, this is a question all Nepali fans are asking these days.
We last played India 10 months ago. The only international match we played after that was against Malaysia. If you look at the domestic scene, there is a one-week-long league and then there is one CoAS cup. How can we expect all this to help us build a side capable of beating India?

You have been saying that the future of the women’s game is brighter than that of men. Why so?
If you look at the FIFA ranking, Nepal’s men’s squad are ranked near the bottom. But Nepali women are ranked around 105th in the ranking. India is ranked 51th. If we can challenge India, it would not be difficult for us to be ranked at least 50th in the world. If FIFA’s decision to have a 48-team World Cup is implemented for the women’s game also, we would be close to qualifying! Now tell me, when can Nepal’s men’s squad even dream of qualifying for the World Cup?
What do you think administrators of the game need to do to promote the game in Nepal?
The first thing we need to do is make the women’s league stronger. What we have right now is a U-14 national squad and a national squad, we need teams in between as well. Why don’t we have a U-23 team, or a U-19 team? The second thing we need is a role model for young girls to look up to. If we have role models, they can inspire young girls to take up the game, and dream of playing for the national team.
There are many other things that we need to do. But these things could give us a start.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-future-womens-football-brigther-mens-coach-kumar-thapa.html,sports
The hits and misses of football’s January transfer window,"Friday, January 13, 2017","The crazy time of the year is here for football…again. The January Transfer Window is open and there are some wild fires being put out! Sanchez Outta Arsenal? James To Chelsea? Winter Window 2017, promises to be a good one.
1.
Oscar to China
The transfer of one of the most promising midfielders in the blues setup to a lowly league is a blow for football.
Maybe the motivations are capital based and the boy does have enough time on his side to pull a transfer to another European Powerhouse but he will miss out on some valuable play time. It is prudent to remember that most young careers don’t survive this banishment.
And it is even more baffling when you come to the next big transfer so far…
2.
Julian Draxler to PSG
Here’s a story of perseverance that pays off. His transfer from Schalke to Wolfsburg only cemented what was already known; Draxler is another German Midfielder that can produce a performance on his day. And he is only getting better.
The reported £40m deal is PSG fortifying their chances in the Champions League. The domestic league looks wrapped up for a while to come till a Lyon or Marseille rides the special wave. If he does well there…who knows? Maybe Barcelona beckons in the future or maybe, even some English weather.
3.
Kostas Manolas to Arsenal?
This is one transfer that I like a lot. The player’s agent did pretty much come out and describe how Arsenal had a bid rejected by AS Roma in the summer. Now the Gunners revive their interest as Mertesacker’s loan rumours get waftier and Manolas would be a step in a very right direction. His strong presence as Roma’s heart of defence has paid dividend for the club as they sit pretty at 2nd in the Serie A Table.
Chances: 2/5
Roma either shore up fast or this doesn’t even leave the ground
4.
The Memphis Depay Exit
This might be imminent now; another Man Utd no. 7 fails to live upto the moniker. It is not his fault really. A slew of managerial changes, the tiff with LVG and an onslaught of nagging injuries have all kept us from seeing Memphis blossom.
Maybe a loan would help but Mourinho has already come out in the press and declared that this is the winter of sale and he will be looking to raise some cash “to attack the market again in the summer”.
A loan move to Everton is simmering but a sale to another league is more likely.
Chances: 4/5. I hope he moves to Germany.
5.
The Alexis Sanchez Saga
Gunner fans, don’t hate me for this! I am not paying Sanchez and Ozil the wages they want. I would love to see them stay and for Wenger to buy a credible striker that gives him tap ins every week rather than scorpion flicks every once in a bleeding blue moon.
Alexis Sanchez is a player who is deemed too good for Arsenal and for good reason. While their title challenges hardly look stellar, it is the strong rumours of Alexis joining a rival EPL club that ruffles the Arsenal fans’ feathers and why not. Sanchez along with Ozil have been the difference makers more often than not. He would walk into any Premiership squad’s First 11 any given Sunday.
But I hope instead of this, Arsenal signs Cavan; Another transfer rumour that just refuses to die. Who knows, he might be the Suarez they need.
Chances: 3/5. The fans will riot.
6.
Scheneiderlin to Goodison
This is more or less happening. Another casualty of the merry go round at Old Trafford but good for the Frenchman.
He was stellar in the Euros and deserves to be starting every game. A move to Everton should see his career make the right swivel although a move abroad to Ligue A or even the Serie A would have worked. Morgan is a dedicated, hard working midfielder that can belt a few screamers as well.
Chances: 4/5. Good on ya fella! And finally…
7.
James Rodriguez to….
Chelsea. I mean the sale of Oscar just cements which way this is going to go. City were interested, Juve is still hot on his heels but the man looks more than likely to end up at Stamford Bridge by the time January is done.
On the back of an amazing World Cup prominence James ( the first time the world pronounced it has HAmes!) is a player who has really suffered with a Madrid squad that is too good to break and a devastating injury. He could never force his way in that team again and it is not difficult to see why. Los Blancos have rivaled Barca’s all time win streak and look set to go all the way for the Spanish Title.
In circumstances as such, James would be a fool not to move to a club that looks set to win their domestic league this term. A space has opened up with Oscar leaving and one would think, Conte would take him over Willian sooner than later.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hits-misses-footballs-january-transfer-window.html,sports
"Bardiya express: At 15, barefoot athlete debuts at National Games, runs neck ‘n neck with Olympian","Sunday, December 25, 2016","
Itahari, December 25
At the 100m race event of the seventh National Games underway in eastern Nepal, a bare-footed athlete took position side by side former Olympian Chandra Kala Thapa.
The hastily-completed track of Itahari’s stadium was strewn with pebbles and plastic wrappers but what was more striking was the disparities between the various teams and athletes that were present at the event.
“There’s no prospect of any records being broken today,” said one of the judges looking at the poor condition of the track.
But the track, as well as the organisers, did not hinder Bardiya’s Jaya Rani Chaudhary from completing the race. Chaudhary, who has ventured out of her hometown of Bardiya for the first time, not only finished the race; she also proved to be a strong competition for Thapa, who finished merely 0.28 second faster than Chaudhary.
Below is an excerpt from a conversation Jaya Rani Chaudhary had win OnlineKhabar after the race.
Congratulations on finishing the race. Where are you from?
I hail from Bardiya district. I am originally from Orali Bazar but I currently live in Gulariya. I live in a hostel there.
How old are you?
I will be 16 in a few months.
Have you finished school?
No. I currently study in grade 7.
Tell us about your selection process. How were you selected?
I am quite active in sports. My school pushed me to compete in district-level games. After being selected at the preliminary round on December 9, I made it to the final selection on December 13.


Which sports were you active in?
Almost every sports; from volleyball to athletics and even football.
Have you come to Itahari before this?
No. This is the third time I have ventured out of Bardiya.
What has been your best record?
I had finished the 100m race in 14 seconds during my district-level selection.
You were bare-footed during that race too?
Yeah, I was not wearing any shoes.
Didn’t you trainer ever tell you to wear shoes?
I am used to running this way. If I wear shoes, my legs feel heavy.
At the event today, there were former Olympians and other professional athletes who were being helped by their trainers before entering the track. Do you ever feel that you would win medals if you had trainers helping you out?
Yes. Of course. But I can hardly do anything. My teachers often say that I am untrained and I can’t win any medals unless I am trained.
Will you continue your schooling after the national games? Or do you plan to train yourself further as an athlete?
I want to continue both.
Who will be waiting for you at home in Bardiya?
Because I live at a hostel in Gulariya, I hardly get to meet my parents unless it is during major festivals like Maghi.
Will we get to meet you at the next national games?
Hopefully yes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bardiya-express-16-barefoot-athlete-debuts-national-games-runs-neck-n-neck-olympian.html,sports
Ravichandran Ashwin: The science and art behind the ‘carrom’ ball,"Monday, December 19, 2016","
With a victory over England in the fourth test by an innings and 36 runs, India’s cricket team have secured their fifth consecutive test series win and have now gone over four years without losing a test match on home soil – a run of 18 matches. Throughout this period we witnessed the meteoric rise of Ravichandran Ashwin, India’s prize test match finger spin bowler.
Ashwin, now the number one ranked bowler in world cricket has amassed 15 five-wicket hauls in tests, the highest for any bowler in two successive calendar years. In September he became the second-fastest bowler to claim 200 test wickets in his career.
Statistics aside, success on the world stage is not a matter of chance, quite the contrary. Ashwin’s journey is a culmination of his technical refinement, innovation and the teammates who bowl alongside him.

Refining the technique
While there are many facets that contribute to a successful spin bowler, imparting a high number of revolutions on the ball is seen as critical and the main cause for both the ball’s “drift” in the air and deviation off the pitch. Coupled with the ability to pitch the delivery in advantageous areas, elite finger spin bowlers such as Ashwin play an integral role in the success of teams competing in the international game.
A forthcoming study on the biomechanics of elite finger spin bowling, led by myself and my colleague, Mark King, at Loughborough University in conjunction with the England and Wales Cricket Board, profiled 30 elite male finger spin bowlers over a four-year period (including the English spinners Graeme Swann, Monty Panesar and James Tredwell). Our team of researchers explored the technical factors within a bowling action that influence the rate at which a ball spins.
The team observed very strong positive relationships between the orientation of the bowler’s pelvis and the rate at which the ball spins during flight, particularly at the instance of front foot contact and ball release. These findings created a compelling argument that highly advanced motions of the pelvis are paramount to producing high spin rates to the ball and therefore that spin bowling should not be solely thought of as an upper arm skill.
The movement during the ball’s flight is due to its “lift” or Magnus force, which affects the way a ball reacts during motion. This movement occurs because on the side of the ball which is advancing due to the spin motion the air flow is slowed down, creating a high pressure region. On the other, receding side, it creates a low pressure region. The difference in pressure causes a “lateral” force perpendicular to the ground and a lateral movement of the ball during flight. This is known as drift.
The force of the lift will vary in direction and magnitude and depends on the amount of spin and the axis along which the ball is spinning. In addition, cricket balls have a seam, and spinners commonly apply spin along the line of this seam to help their grip on the ball. This means the spin axis is commonly kept perpendicular to the direction of the seam, promoting a stable seam position and the possibility of the ball deviating off the seam the moment it hits the pitch.
When the ball meets the pitch surface, particularly in India (due to drier pitches creating high friction between the ground and the ball), this commonly creates large lateral deviation and a heightened challenge to the opposing batsman.
Coming back to Ashwin, since 2012 he has noticeably made a number of key technical changes to his bowling action to improve alignment and promote a transfer of momentum throughout his delivery stride. In 2016, he now bowls with a slightly open pelvis orientation when his front foot hits the ground. This differs to the strictly side-on, or at times closed-off pelvis orientation that he used when releasing the ball back in 2012. He now has the ability to rotate his pelvis effectively and efficiently, promoting the transfer of kinetic energy from the pelvis to the hand as he releases the ball, and so injecting greater spin onto the ball.

Partnerships and pace
Humility is a strong virtue in any individual. With this in mind, Ashwin’s rise to stardom has to be partly credited to his orthodox left arm spin partner, Ravindra Jadeja.
Between November 2015 and the end of the fourth test against England in mid-December 2016, India’s star duo had accumulated the most wickets in test cricket – an incredible 124. The pair are unrelentingly accurate, with Jadeja mounting great pressure, bowling 53 maidens (an over, or six consecutive deliveries where no run is scored) in the current series against England alone.
The speed at which the ball is released also plays a significant role in the success of an elite spin bowler. When a new, competent batsman enters the crease, they use the idiosyncratic cues provided by the bowler, such as the release velocity, height, and angle of preceding deliveries. This forms a mental template of the ball’s trajectory – essentially an attempt to predict the trajectories of the deliveries to follow.
Here, Ashwin’s subtle variation of the speed and the axis around which he spins the ball comes into play. He commonly delivers his stock ball with an initial release speed around 54mph. Variations of pace close to this speed may exploit a batsman’s mental template and take advantage of the batsman’s subtle “blindness” to length and speed. This can create a fatal weakness in judgement, particularly for any new batsman at the crease.
The new batsman’s ability to tell what speed and trajectory the ball will arrive is now sub-optimal, meaning vital mistakes are made in deciding whether to come forward or back when playing the ball. This can result in a quick return to the dressing room.

Innovation
Ashwin can also be considered as one of the modern game’s great innovators through his use of a unique delivery known as the “carrom” or “sodukku ball”, meaning “snapping of fingers” in the Tamil language.


When delivering the carrom ball, Ashwin spins the ball using half as many revolutions as he would with one of his regular deliveries. The ball is released out of the front of the hand as opposed to the side, using the middle digit to impart spin. As a result it is very difficult for the opposing batsman to distinguish and therefore a dangerous tool of deception.
With this magnitude of spin, the ball’s trajectory is much straighter and results in many wickets as the opposing batsman often plays down the wrong line of trajectory. As a result, Ashwin, who is one of the very few operators of this delivery in the world game, has one of the highest percentages of dismissals for leg before wicket in test cricket to date.
All this has combined to make Ravichandran Ashwin one of the most effective bowlers in today’s modern game.

Why sacking Jose Mourinho is not the way out for Manchester United,"Monday, November 14, 2016","Remember Louis Van Gaal? The surly Dutchman who orchestrated his career downfall at Man United even with the likes of Angel Di Maria and Falcao at his disposal? Similar to the appointment of Jose Mourinho, whose nomination as the manager of Manchester United looked like a great marriage on paper, Louis’s was also a story of much promise.
Post David Moyes, MoUnited fans were clamouring for a man who was suitable to replace Sir Alex. Louis seemed like the hand the glove needed but what came next was even more fitting.
Louis beat Moyes’s record for the worst first 15 games (something that MoUnited came close to breaking), was constantly handling questions by the media as tactfully as a bull in a china shop. All of this led to him wasting a slew of talent, playing them out of position and eventually accepting his fate.
Ironically, Mourinho had gotten the axe for doing the exact same things at Chelsea.
It was like they were destined to meet. Man United under Mourinho was probably written in the stars when he famously ran down the touchline at Old Trafford and his FC Porto knocked out The Red Devils at home.


The fans hated him for doing that, but respected this brash young kid who wasn’t shy of the backlash. It reminded them of another arrogant young prick that led them to a lot of glory. So naturally his arrival at the Theatre of Dreams was treated like the homecoming of the prodigal child. Then came Zlatan, Paul Pogba in a world record move and astute signings like Eric Baillhy and Mkhitaryan as well.
And yet, here we are in November with criticisms rife against Mourinho with fans demanding that he be sacked.
But where did it go wrong for Mourinho and the Devils?
Good player bad position
The most heard refrain that has echoed in TV studios with pundits and fans in chat rooms is the bad positioning of players. Now that Zlatan isn’t that effective up front, people are losing their mind as to why Rashford is not playing centre.
Read also: The meteoric rise of Leicester City and the men behind it
Well you’ll have to excuse Mourinho for going with a seasoned Veteran who has championed every side he has been in (except Barcelona) and played that target man role brilliantly. Now unfortunately, defenders have realised that man-marking him is the right way to go and at 35, he is not at his fastest to blaze past them too; leaving us with a conundrum. Should Mourinho drop Zlatan and go for another philosophy of play apart from Long Ball City?
Ruin-ney
No matter what anybody tells you, or whatever you have read online; always remember that Rooney has, is and always will be one of the most effective EPL players ever. It is a crying shame how quickly the fans (especially National) have turned on him and forgotten what a pivotal figure he has been in English football. His legacy at Man United is cemented and he will go down as one of the legends. He is definitely not past his peak.


Rooney behind RVP was one of the best masterstrokes Sir Alex ever produced and even though Mourinho tried to emulate it this season with Zlatan and Roo, he did not give it enough time to gel. A fit Rooney can walk onto the field for a Real or Barca side; Mourinho really needs to sort him out.
You wanna play long ball, right?
Then where are Valencia or Darmian as right wing back? Luke Shaw does a stellar job every time he is deployed but it is the right of Man United that seems to be lacking. If Mourinho didn’t have faith in both of them, he should have atleast tried to push the board to hand him a suitable candidate. And that too seems quite foolhardy as there is Antonio flippin’ Valencia right there! Waiting!
Stop Blaming Players
For all his career, one of Mourinho’s most likeable team trait has been how he shields players from media scrutiny and takes all the heat himself. He does this for his locker room and has done a good job at it. This term though, we have seen a more frustrating side of him, which we do when he is losing. His treatment and quotes about players like Lindgaard and Mkhitaryan have raised a few eyebrows and furthermore, he has constantly deflected questions when it comes to his failed tactics.
Read also: This week on EPL: Manchester City are the title favourites
To be frank, he has done this all throughout his career but it is when he fails, that a psychological approach like this back fires. Now he sounds like a petulant child who likes to blame everyone except for holding himself accountable.
Remember, it is the 11 players who go on the field to play the game. At times, there is just way too much blame put on coaches but we don’t live in a sensible era do we? Dear lord no! We live in an era where everyone is a pundit and I somehow have convinced you of the same with merely a 12 year understanding of the EPL.
But trust me there are worse. Like Man City fans talking about legacy and not knowing who Richard Dunne was.
But sacking Jose Mourinho is not the answer. Let’s get this straight: Jose Mourinho, is one of the best coaches in world football and it has been an honour to see him give Chelsea a title after  50 years, teach the world how to break Tiki Taka and basically how to be every interviewer’s wet dream. He is just getting started and I really do wish that people would stop freaking out so much. Especially Man United fans.
Calm down #MoUnited.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sacking-jose-mourinho-not-way-manchester-united.html,sports
The making of Nepal’s ace spinner Karuna Bhandari,"Thursday, October 20, 2016","

If you hear her sisters call her from afar, you’d probably think you heard them yell out ‘Karane’. But if you listen to them closely, you’d notice that it’s ‘Karune’, an endearment for Karuna Bhandari.
“When I used to play cricket with local boys in Maitidevi, one of my sisters would come to remind me that it was time to go home,” remembers Bhandari. “They would yell my name, and that would make me nervous,” she says.
Born to a family in Sindhupalchowk in 1988, Karuna moved to Kathmandu two years later. For Karuna, a schoolgirl whose daily routine involved carrying the school bag, doing homework and studying for exams, South Africa and Australia were some distant countries on the world map of her School Atlas.
Growing up with a brother, who is 10 years older than her, Karuna had little control over the TV remote. While doing her homework, or just reading a book, she would have no option but to watch whatever her brother decided to watch. Most of the time, it was cricket.
“I think I was around eight-nine years old during the 1999 World Cup,” she shares. “That was the first cricket series I watched seriously, and I was really hooked on to it. I clearly remember the South Africa-Australia semi-final.”
Looking at Ponting and Gilchrist swing their bat, and Kallis and Boje rattle opposition stumps, the nine-year-old dreamt of playing the game in the real world. Walking home from school, she’d seen local boys play the game at a ground near her home. “But I had not seen a girl, not even a single one play with them.”
But that would not deter her. Donning a cap to cover her hair, she’d go play with the boys. “I didn’t want them to know that I was a girl. I was afraid that I’d be judged, and they would stop playing with me.”
“The boys with whom I played did not have the faintest of idea that I was a girl! But I was afraid that my sister’s calls would ruin things.” But even as her sister continued to call her, the players assumed that ‘his’ name was Karan, and ‘his’ sister was calling ‘him’ Karane, an endearment for Karan.
Having regularly played the game for over a decade — later they found out she was a girl, but still allowed her to play, Karuna desperately wanted to play for the national squad. The boys would have her field most of the time, and when she would be allowed to bowl, she’d have to bowl from outside the crease to make up for her pace.
But Nepal did not have a women’s team. “There were days when I would be disappointed. I wanted to play at the international level, represent my country..”
In early 2000s, things changed. Nepal too was going to form a national squad for women. In 2007, Nepali women not only participated in their maiden international tournament, but also made it to the final of the inaugural ACC Women’s Tournament, only to go down to a formidable Bangladesh in the final.



“I knew that Nepali women are also playing cricket. But I did not have anyone to guide me, neither did I have the connections to meet the selectors,” remembers Karuna, who would share her anguish with her five siblings, who would in turn do the same with their co-workers.
“One day my sister told me that her boss had put in a word with the coaches at the Baluwatar Cricket Academy.”
Within a few days, Karuna was bowling her off breaks and honing her fitness at the academy’s ground !
For the first time in her life Karuna felt at ease playing against other ‘Karunas’, not having to play Karan.


In 2011, she debuted for the national squad. During her debut tournament, the ACC Women’s T20 Championship, Karuna claimed four wickets for just 10 runs against Kuwait, including a hat trick. She played an important role in Nepal’s journey to the semifinals of the tournament and qualified for the ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup 2012, held in Guangzhou, China. At the 17th Asian Games, she played an important role for her team to qualify for the quarter final.
At the recently-concluded ICC Women’s T20 Asia qualifier, she put on a stellar performance with the ball, and also chipped in with the bat in a crucial match against Hong Kong. In a match that went to the wire, Karuna, a tail-ender scored 19 vital runs and claimed three wickets to hand her team a six-run win, and book a place in the Asia Cup, where test playing countries like India and Pakistan await Nepal
“I am not a batsman, I am a bowler. I know that. But I am confident that I can find the gaps in the field and rotate strike, even when I am batting,” says a confident Karuna, who is now part of the Armed Police Force’s women’s team.
But more important than that, she’s found and filled a bigger ‘gap’ in Nepali cricket — the lack of role models for aspiring women cricketers. More than 40 women cricketers selected for camp ahead of the ICC Asia qualifiers would agree.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/making-nepals-ace-spinner-karuna-bhandari.html,sports
ACC’s resurrection: What’s in it for Nepali cricket?,"Wednesday, August 24, 2016","Commentary
Sunday this week, heads of cricket associations in Asia gathered in the Sri Lankan capital to discuss the revival of a regional body, which in its heyday played an important role in countries such as Nepal.
The Asian Cricket Council, which was ‘demerged’ (read ‘phased out’)  following a decision by its mother body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), is going to be back again, and by the looks of it, stronger than ever before.


The ACC’s new office has just been inaugurated in Maitland Crescent, Colombo 7, and according to reports, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are in a mood to claim more autonomy from the ICC. They are even likely to fund the ACC’s operations using their own resources, mainly revenue they earn by hosting the Asia Cup, the region’s premier tournament played by countries like India and Pakistan.
The ACC, which now has 25 members (full members and associate members) was set up in 1983, the same year India won the World Cup for the first time. Riding on popularity of live television, India and Pakistan — two countries that could not play each other at home — decided to make Sharjah their venue of choice. Sri Lanka later joined, and the Asia Cup was born, and the ACC was just meant to facilitate the Asia Cup.
Nepal became a member of the ACC  in 1990.

The ACC, since the mid 200os, expanded its presence in Asia, supporting member associations build their capacity in areas such as infrastructure, umpiring, and coaching. According to CAN, the ACC in the recent years provided up to Rs 20 million (around $186,000) per year to Nepal’s association, while that of the ICC was around  Rs 100 million ($ 931, 000) every year.
In 2014, when the South Indian businessman N Srinivasan became Chairman of the ICC, he proposed that cricket’s regional bodies, including the ACC, be ‘demerged’. He held clout in the ICC like no other delegate, as he was also the head of India’s cricket board. While the ACC would retain its right to host the Asia Cup and the U-19 ACC Cup, the ICC would take over all its development programmes, and cut its funding to the regional body. The proposal meant that a ‘skeletal’ office of the ACC would be set up in Singapore, from where the ACC would organise its events.
Although the proposal was criticised as being an attempt to consolidate the grip of the ‘Big Three’ (India, England and Australia) on revenue, it was passed by the ICC, and accepted by the ACC.
After Srinivasan stepped down from both his ICC and BCCI postions following corruption allegations, India’s cricket association got a new leader in Sashank Manohar, who also stepped down soon to be elected ICC chairman. Anurag Thakur, who was general secretary of BCCI, then took charge at BCCI, and one of the first decisions he took was to ‘resurrect’ the ACC.
With backroom negotiations over a month, the ACC found a new home in Sri Lanka, where the government has agreed to bear the administrative expenses for now.
Ashoknath Pyakurel, general secretary of the ‘elected’ CAN, who was in Colombo to attend the inauguration event, claims that ACC has granted membership to his association. He said the ICC’s suspension of CAN will have no bearing on its ties with the ACC.
Nepal’s Cricket Association remains suspended by the ICC. Although the national squads have not been denied place in international tournaments, the ICC has not done anything for domestic development. In the absence of the ACC, Nepal’s international outings had also been limited — the ACC used to host a number of tournaments round the year.
According to reports, the situation is likely to change soon. The new ACC has established a development and executive body, which is likely to come up with tournaments in 2016 itself.  But as long as CAN’s suspension remains, Nepal will not host any international tournament.
Nepal will play tournaments it is qualified to play in, and in addition to that Nepali umpires and coaches will participate in training programmes.
Details will unfold in the days to come.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/accs-resurrection-whats-nepali-cricket.html,sports
"Sunil Dhamala: He is an opening batsman, and he likes Sehwag","Tuesday, August 9, 2016","
When Sunil Dhamala was growing up near Chandigarh in India, it was not the teenager, who was running after cricket. It was the other way round.
Born to a family living in one of Nepal’s remotest districts Kalikot during the peak of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal in 1997, Dhamala and his family moved to India for better opportunities within a few years after Sunil’s birth.
And as the young Dhamala’s vocal chords learnt to say ‘aama-buwa’, his hands picked up the technique to hold the bat, and then to use it to hit the ball out of the park. “I don’t exactly remember when I started playing cricket, but I think it must be during my early teens,” says Dhamala, who is on the list of probables for Nepal’s World Cricket League fixtures against the Netherlands this week.
“Cricket was, and is, everywhere in India. It was also the area where I lived with my parents, and two siblings,” he recounts.

Name a milestone in Indian cricket, and Dhamala would have watched it unfold live on tv. But one event Dhamala, who was just seven, remembers quite well is the 309 then Indian opener Virender Sehwag made against Pakistan, earning him the title ‘Multan ka Sultan’.
Sehwag’s innings was special for Dhamala, who considers the flamboyant opener as his idol. “He used to play his natural game, even when conditions were not in favour,” says Dhamala. “That is a trait I have learnt from him. He does not occupy the crease for the sake of it.”
Dhamala went on to play age-group cricket in India, he also represented his district in local tournaments. A teenager surrounded by Indian friends, for whom cricket is more than religion, Dhamala, who did not yet understand what being a ‘Nepali’ meant, dreamed of playing for India some day.
But when his age caught up with the runs coming off his bat, Dhamala  fancied playing for his own country, his country of birth. In conversations with Nepali relatives living in Dhangadhi, on Facebook, Dhamala got clues that Nepal also had a cricket team.
“Around three years ago, I came to Dhangadhi for Dashain. There I visited the local academy, and told them I was interested in playing for the local side,” he shares. That decision to play for the local side would be the first step towards entering the domestic structure in Nepal, and eventually the U-19 national squad.
As part of the U-19 team that played the junior world cup in January this year, Dhamala was one of the highest run-getters for his squad going into the tournament. In the qualifiers, he scored a 47 and a 75 against Ireland.
He could not strike similar form at the world cup. However, during the much-hyped encounter against India, he was dismissed for duck. His bat’s silence was broken in the last match against Namibia — he scored a 58 — though the team’s exit was already certain.
The experience, though, has not changed Dhamala’s attitude towards cricket. “We all have bad runs, don’t we?” he asks. “But that does not mean I should stop playing my natural game.”
That’s the attitude he wants to carry to the games against the Netherlands this week, whether he makes it to the playing XI or not.

"For this Nepali soldier, cricket pitch is where his battle is","Thursday, July 7, 2016","
When Bikram Sob was growing up in Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, India, local teams approached him to go play in Dehradun, the state capital.
Sob wanted to play cricket with them, but he knew that his parents, especially his dad, a jeweler, would not approve of it.
“I toyed with the idea for sometime. But dad would never approve.”
“I thought my dad would not have the money to pay for the travel and accommodation,” says Sob, who secretly nurtured his dream to play top-level cricket someday.
“I used to watch the South African pacer Dale Steyn play. I liked his bowling, rhythm, his attitude and energy. When playing with friends, I would try to imitate his action,” he remembers.
**

In November 2015, Nepal’s national cricket squad, still shaken by the April quake, was playing in Abu Dhabi. The squad, which was to stay home to play its World Cricket League matches against rivals Papua New Guinea in a few days, was playing a two-day match against Hong Kong.
On the first day of the match, Sob, who was selected as one of Nepal’s strike bowlers, could not take a single wicket in the eight overs he bowled. “That night I went to my room a bit early, and reviewed my performance. I tried to understand what had gone wrong,” he remembers.
The next day, the army man, was on fire. In his second over of the day, Sob got opening batsman Waqas Barkat caught behind, then showed Aizaz Khan, the number three, his way towards the pavilion in the same fashion. Tanwir Afzal, who was on strike on the ‘hattrick’ ball, managed to put his bat to ball. But he was out LBW the next ball.
**
Sob and his family, originally from Mahendranagar in Far-Western Nepal, migrated to Pithoragarh in 1994 looking for better opportunities. They stayed there for 10 years, and then decided to come back to Nepal.
“I had finished my SLC, and my brothers their Plus Two. We had no option but to move out of the city for further education.”
“Dad said let’s go back to our own country, and we packed our bags.”
Sob, who had not been to Nepal for 10 years, did not know cricket was fast becoming a popular sport in Nepal. The family’s decision to return home proved as a blessing in disguise.
Back in Nepal, he played for the local U-16 and U-19 squads. His side, Baitadi, even won the national U-19 tournament in 2012.  But he never received a call for the national side at the age-group level.
“I think it was then that I realised that making it to the national squad required something extra. It was combination of skills and fitness.”
***

In 2013, Sob was thinking of quitting cricket and concentrating on his studies, when cricket got him an opportunity to join the army. The national army was looking for youngsters for its cricket team, and the fast bowler was on the list of probables.
Soon he was training to join the army. “The training was rigorous. You only got few hours of sleep,” he remembers.
“There were times when I wanted to quit and go home. But my love for cricket kept me going.”
***
After his stellar performance against Hong Kong, Nepali fans expected that he would get a place in the important match against PNG. But he didn’t.
“It was because we saw that PNG players were comfortable playing pace. So the coach decided to go with spinners. That was the reason I was not selected.”
But as Nepal prepare to play a friendly against Marylebone Cricket Club in England on July 19, and a WCLC series against the Netherlands in their home turf, Sob is optimistic. “The wickets there are going to be fast, and spin will not be effective,” he says.
“The battle will be between their batsmen and our pacers.”

Meet the First Family of Nepali badminton,"Monday, June 13, 2016","
If you have been to the final of a national level badminton tournament in the past few years, you may have seen Saradevi Tamang, her brother Ratnajit or sister Nangshal play as a team or as individuals.
It would be an understatement to say that the Tamangs from Bhojpur have dominated the sport for the last few years. Sara has been the number one in women’s singles for the last three years. And when she is not in top form, her sister leads the rankings.
The beginning
Back in the 80s, badminton in Nepal was not even considered a serious sport. It was viewed as an early morning activity that would help Kathmandu’s well-off sweat diabetes out. Upon their transfer from Kathmandu to other parts of the country, government officers would head for the districts with rackets and shuttles to continue their hobby.

One of them was a Nepal food corporation officer, who had been transferred to Bhojpur. “He’d gather men from surrounding areas in the morning to play badminton,” says Sara, who is now a captain in the Nepal Army.
Every day, early morning, the men would play for hours on end, and the officer would teach them the rules. “Our dad took the game very seriously,” says Sara. “He would take part in the district-level tournaments, and even go to Kathmandu to play national level tournaments in Kathmandu — a rarity in those times,” she remembers.
Sara was born in 1984, her sister Nangshal three years later, and brother Ratnajit in 1993.
“Our dad would come back home to tell us about the ‘lahurinis’ in Kathmandu who win tournaments after tournaments, and tell us that he wants us to take up the sport,” Sara remembers. But she had to wait until she was 11 for her father to get her a new racket.
“Until then, they (our father and uncles) would not allow us to play with them. We were too small for them,” says Nangshal, who now plays for the Army under a contract.
But in the case of Ratnajit, he was allowed to take up the racket at an earlier age. “Look at him play, learn something from him, our dad used to tell us,” says Nangshal.
While the father, the son and the daughters were busy honing their shots and blocks, the mother was worried about the future of her children. “Our mum would say that we had to study, and badminton would get us nowhere,” shares Ratnajit.

Sara, who first started her badminton career with the APF club, competed for a place in the army, and successfully cleared all tests. With her help, her brother Ratanjit also joined the army. Meanwhile, Nangshal, who is not an army staff, got the opportunity to play for the Army under a players’ contract.
Although the Tamangs have dominated the sport in Nepal, for over half a decade, they haven’t been able to translate domestic successes into international trophies. At the peak of her game in December 2015, Sara was ranked 380th in the world, Nangshal’s best ranking, also in December 2015, was 434th and Ratnajit’s was 193rd in October 2015.
The family started playing badminton out of sheer interest, and went on with it without much of technical knowledge. They were not products of a state mechanism to develop and train shuttlers in Nepal. “When I play at the international level, I realise the vast difference between our skills and that of our opponents,” says Sara, who played the Indian shuttler PV Sindu, and was defeated 21-2, 21-8. “The only thing that was positive was that in the second set, I managed to get 8 points.”
Ratnajit also feels that although he puts in a hundred per cent effort every time, there is a gap, which can be fulfilled only through training and experience.
Sara, who has been recuperating from a torn ligament, says her dream is to get new talents into the game, coach them, and give them what she and her siblings could not get. “I am hopeful that I can recuperate soon, and make a comeback in a big way,” she says. “Then I can think of fulfilling my dream.”
So what does their mum say about their game now?
“When I do not play well, she calls me up and orders me to take the game seriously,” Ratnajit says with a giggle.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/meet-first-family-nepali-badminton.html,sports
The meteoric rise of Leicester City and the men behind it,"Tuesday, May 24, 2016","They are calling it the best English Premier League season ever.
As the blue and white confetti is still being swept off Leicester’s City Square, fans who follow the English side of football are still reeling with withdrawal.
The betting odds of Leicester City Football Club winning the Premier League was 5000/1 at the start of the season. They were flirting with relegation the last season and were not even close to a Europa League spot.
But something was bubbling under the surface. The club made the right signings under a manager with an European pedigree and then never looked back. Leicester City’s rise has been meteoric, winning the 3rd and 2nd division of football in succession to achieve a Premier League status.
Claudio Ranieri, the club’s manager, has been hailed as the ‘Tinkerman’ since his days at Chelsea when a bright-eyed, brash Portuguese named Jose Mourinho took his spot. This moniker comes from his habit of switching his first 11 every week to better the rest of his players; a tradition that does not go down fairly well in England (just ask Benitez at Liverpool).
His first season at Leicester saw injuries to key players. This tinkering with the squad, which in all fairness was to protect the squad from fatigue, failed him. But the stars aligned this season in the most unbelievable way.
Riyad Mahrez and the Supporting Cast
Riyad Mahrez is on his way to becoming a world-class footballer.It was during the LFC’s demolition of Manchester City on their home ground that people noticed the genius of this Algerian, and it has been upward and onward for him since then. Mahrez’s silky runs and the audacious ability to shoot with both feet are what spearheaded an impressive cast of players who all deserve their due.
N’Golo Kante, the defensive midfielder was nominated for the League’s ‘Player of The Year’ award at the end of this season. For a Defensive Midfielder to receive an accolade reserved for more attacking position players is a feat. And make no bones about it, Kante has broken more attacks and has powered the engine of LFC’s midfield with Danny Drinkwater, a man who recently won his first English cap. He is set to do what he did for Leicester with the national team.
Drinkwater’s ability to read an attack and its breaking up only to launch a blistering attack on the other end is what Leicester needed and is badly what England needs next month at the Euros.
Man U fans will know the name Schmeichel. Kasper Schmeichel’s father Peter is heralded as one of the best keepers of club football and it was with some promise that I saw him make his debut at Man City nearly 7 years ago. Frequent ownership and managerial changes saw him look elsewhere for first team football and when it was announced that he was signing with Leicester, all seemed rather bleak for Kasper’s living upto his family name. But a number of point blank, cat like saves throughout the season have proven that Goalkeeping is a gift in that family.
#ChatSh*tGetBanged
In my decade-and-a-half of following this league, I haven’t seen one man inspire a team the way Jamie Vardy has. Not only that, he inspired a nation and made them go back to their roots. Here’s a lad who you would meet at the pub, have a pint with and then go for a Sunday kickabout.
Here’s, a story of a footballer who signed from non league football for 1 million pounds–which is peanuts in this line of work. He is the success story that rivals, rival fans, managers, everyone just adores because in 2016 with oil money deeply en-soaking the beautiful game, a lanky blue-eyed English boy and a run of the mill football club slayed the giants of the sport. And how!
Dilly Ding Dilly Dong!
That’s all we need to echo at this time. England, the league and we as fans are still reeling at what has just happened in the Premier League. It’s the fairytale everyone wanted to believe in but what were waiting for reality to kick it in the teeth. The reality was, they were head and shoulders better than Manchester United, better than Manchester City, everybody was better than Chelsea! And Leicester only Leicester, deserved to win the league.
Everybody from around world wishes that the key players stay. The Kantes, the Vardys, the Mahrezs, we hope everybody stays because if they could do this to the best teams in England, well, they are in the Champion’s League now.
For the Leicester City Vs Barcelona match next year, you know who we will be supporting. Maybe the Jamie Vardy Party brings home the Champions League crown next season. You never know, crazier things have just happened in football.

Nepal’s sports council to organise two-day cricket tournament ahead of nat’l team’s Europe tour,"Friday, May 13, 2016","
Kathmandu, May 13
Nepal’s Sports Council has said it will organise a two-day cricket tournament for senior players, in the run up to the national team’s tour to Europe.
The council’s Member Secretary Keshab Kumar Bista told Onlinekhabar the tournament (Prime Minister’s Cup) will be organised within the second week of June.
The announcement comes just weeks after the International Cricket Council banned Nepal’s cricket association citing government intervention in the administration of the game.
Bista said separate tournaments will be organised for men and for women. The men’s team is to travel to the UK in July to play a friendly against Marylebone Cricket Club, considered one of the oldest in the world, at Lord’s. The team will then go to the Netherlands, where they will take on the hosts in the fourth round of the World Cricket League Division I.
Bista said that the council decided to adopt the two-day format in view of the recommendations made by cricket coaches and players. “We have a budget of around Rs 6 million to organise the tournament,” said Bista.
Since the tournament is being organised just ahead of the tour, players are expected to be selected for the national squad based on their performance during the matches.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-sports-council-organise-two-day-tournament-ahead-natl-teams-europe-tour.html,sports
"If given the right team, I am open to leading CAN again: Former chief Binaya Raj Pandey","Friday, April 29, 2016","
Binaya Raj Pandey was general secretary of Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) when the governing body became a member of the ACC and an associate member of ICC in the early 90s. He became president of CAN in September 2006, and served in the position for five years before he was relieved of the post by the National Sports Council. Onlinekhabar’s Abhaya Raj Joshi and Kushal Timilsena caught up with Pandey to talk about the suspension handed by the ICC to CAN, and Nepali cricket’s past and future. Translated excerpts:
You went to the TU Cricket Ground after four years to watch the match between Nepal and Namibia. What are some of the changes you noticed there?
Before I get to that, let me tell you a few things from history. The ground was constructed by India’s Zee TV. After that, we couldn’t develop it further because we had no money. When I went there this time, I saw that new structures had been added to the ground. But I do not think they have been completed. I also think they were not built in accordance with the plan to transform the ground into a stadium someday. Except for the compound wall, other construction work was done just to spend the money that was made available, it appears.
With that said, I was happy to see that the government did show its concern for the ground.
The match between Nepal and Namibia was the biggest-ever played in Nepal. How do you feel to have been a part of it?
No, this was not the biggest match ever played in Nepal. The biggest tournament we hosted in Nepal was the Division V tournament in which teams from eight countries had participated. If you look at it in terms of ‘level’, then you are right.
When I was with the association, we were organising tournaments. During my tenure as president, we would organise 1-2 international matches every year. As you know, the craze for cricket has always been big in Nepal. This was the third time we played against Namibia. Nepal played well. The team looked mature. The innings both Sarad and Paras played showed that they are experienced players.

Watching the match in Kirtipur, and listening to the crowd, did you not remember the early days of cricket in Nepal?
Cricket has always received a lot of support from the fans as well as the media. I have always been saying that whenever we’d play an international match, at least
10, 000-15, 000 spectators would show up, even during the early days. When we organised the ACC Trophy in 1998, teams like Bangladesh came to Nepal, and the spectators were there to watch the matches.
But I must admit that when we played the T20 World Cup in 2014 in Bangladesh, Nepal’s cricket reached another level. Everyone, including the members of the private sector, was attracted to the game. On the one hand, football was not doing well, while on the other, our cricketers were winning matches after matches. Everyone realised that cricket is the sport in which Nepal has a future, and people were ready to invest in it. Unfortunately, national cricket association leadership could not cash in on this achievement.
So can we say that the more popular a game becomes, the more is its attraction for people, who are not directly involved in it?
This happens everywhere. It is not unusual for people to take notice of success, and want to take advantage from it. But the main point I want to drive home is that three key bodies — the government, the sports council and CAN — should not be looking to milk cricket for personal gains. If you see that any one of the three is doing so, then it’s a sign that things are going to get worse. That is exactly what has happened with cricket in Nepal.
If we go back to 2014, we played the World Cup, we were given T20 status, but we could not hold on to it for long. We gradually moved in the opposite direction. I do not think that the players alone are responsible for what has happened. That the management could not prepare good development plans, and keep the players satisfied, was the main reason for the failure.
After the T20 World Cup, CAN should have transformed itself into an efficient and effective body. But the opposite happened. Immediately after the World Cup, the players organised protests, and the ICC blocked its funding to CAN. During that period, no attempt was made to contact the ICC. When they were fined, they only looked at it in monetary terms, and did not communicate with the ICC to settle issues it had raised before blocking the funds.
CAN’s suspension did not happen overnight. Things were moving in that direction since 2014. The ICC keeps note of every minute detail. Have you ever heard a team travelling with four managers? At the end of the day, it was the ICC that was paying for their expenses.
Could you tell us how has CAN’s relationship with the ICC been like in the past?
We were in very good terms. During my term in office, there was only one incident over which ICC imposed some punishment on Nepal. The lone incident took place in 2010 when spectators threw stones at the players after a match which Nepal lost. But we communicated well with the ICC, and it gave us some guidelines for us to follow. When we complied with the guidelines, they were ready to let us host international matches again.
Did Nepal comply with all of ICC’s guidelines when it became an associate?
In the 1980s, you could easily become an associate member. All you had to do was to present a proposal. In 1990, we became a member of the Asian Cricket Council, but we were yet to become an ICC associate. In a few months, the ICC’s representatives visited Nepal, but they reported that we did not have the infrastructure to get associate status.
We then communicated with the ICC, and they told us the minimum infrastructure we’d need to become an associate. During those days, cricket was only played in Kathmandu, and there were some groups, who played it in Birgunj, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar. But it was not played seriously. It was played as a pastime.
Upendra Bhattarai used to organise a national-level tournament in the name of his late father. The tournament used to be played in Tundikhel. We invited ICC representatives to Nepal during the final of the tournament, which was played in Dashrath Stadium. A few hundred spectators had gathered to watch the match. We told the ICC representatives that the stadium was where we’d play cricket.
They were impressed, and soon Nepal was granted associate status.
But we did not have money. We could not even afford an office. For 30 years, CAN worked out of my own personal office. In 2000, when Zee TV setup office in Kathmandu, they gave us a room. In 2002, we moved to our own office.

Did the ICC not say anything about submitting audit reports on time, and hiring a full-time CEO?
No, those are issues that cropped up later. There are many things about Nepali cricket that people say without knowing the reality. The fact is that when a team reaches Division II, then its corresponding association has to comply with more guidelines. When we reached Division II, then only the ICC told us to hire a full-time CEO and a finance manager. For teams that are below Division II, an office space is sufficient.
It’s been more than 60 years since CAN was established. You had been around since 1960s. But CAN’s first-ever election was held only a few years ago.
I see that people have a misunderstanding about CAN. One man organised  a press conference and claimed that I did not hold elections in the association for 40 years. Even the National Sports Council, which should have known better, towed the same line. No one asked me what the truth was.
When we started out, the game was only played in Kathmandu. We used to play in Tundikhel. We felt that someone should take the responsibility of organising the matches. That is when we formed a group to do so. I was made the general secretary. I was made the general secretary of ‘cricket’, not CAN. There were small clubs in Kathmandu, and they used to play against each other.
When was CAN registered with the sports council?
I think it was around 1947 that CAN was registered with the NSC. In the late 1980s, then NSC General Secretary Sharad Chandra Shah helped organise a national tournament for cricket. His precondition was that there shall be at least five teams from five different zones, but in the end we had 11 teams.
After 1990 Sharad Chandra Shah was no longer the member-secretary. The government had cut funding for all sports, and there was a general decline in people’s interest for any game. This was reflected in cricket as well. Only seven of us were left in the association. We ran CAN for around six years; we’d organise at least one national tournament every year. When we became a full member of the ACC, we went to the then Member Secretary Keshav Sthapit seeking his help to build a bigger team, and he helped us form a 20-member ad-hoc committee.

During your term in office, many said the board was closer to its counterpart in Sri Lanka, and this was at the cost of India.
No. You must be talking about the coaches we’ve had so far. Roy Dias, who was Nepal’s coach before Pubudu came, was nominated by the ACC. The ACC had sent us a list of three prospective candidates for the position. We thought that Roy was the best, and we appointed him as coach. When I became president, Roy was in the last days of his tenure, and Nepal was still in Division V. We were playing Division V for the second time. So I had told Roy that if Nepal did not perform well this time, I would not be able to keep him as coach.
Nepal lost that tournament, and we had to say bye to Roy, who has contributed a lot to Nepali cricket.
How was Pubudu chosen?
In 2011, I was in Bombay to watch the World Cup. On one evening I was having dinner with the chief of Cricket Canada, who told me about Pubudu. “We have this excellent coach who took us to the World Cup, but we are not going to renew his contract,” he had told me. When he told me that he’s gotten the team to the World Cup, I thought that he could be the right man for Nepal. I emailed him saying that we were looking for coach, and if he was interested.
He told me that he would come for six months, and if he liked it here, he’d stay for a longer period. But 15 days after he came, I had to leave CAN.
Would the team have gotten better exposure in India, if the coach was from India?
If we had brought an Indian coach, you’d say: Why did we not go for an Aussie coach?
But in terms of proximity..
We must understand that the cricket board in India is the leader of world cricket. The board does not have time to think about the neighbourhood. It thinks only about itself.
Let me give you an example. When then Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal visited India, I had arranged a meeting with the BCCI chief. Nepal’s Prime Minister had proposed that the BCCI help build a stadium in Nepal. The BCCI told our Prime Minister that they would not be able to do it because if they built a stadium in Nepal, other countries in the neighbourhood would also expect the same.
At the end of the day, it is the coach’s skills that matter. I must say that all of the coaches we’ve had so far contributed positively to Nepal.
You were running CAN with an ad-hoc committee till 2010. Why didn’t you conduct elections?
During that time, all that we were worried about was complying with the ACC and ICC charters. We could not pay attention to conducting elections. In 2000, we prepared a new charter for CAN. But the sports council did not approve it. There were certain provisions, especially on the autonomy of CAN, that the NSC had reservations about. In 2005, I became president, and I continued to lobby for the charter to be passed.  We had to wait until Yubaraj Lama became member-secretary of the council to get the charter passed.
Lama ordered us to conduct elections within three months. But I wanted the elections to first take place at the local level. For that I needed a year. So Lama removed me and formed an ad-hoc committee to conduct elections.
When members of the previous board were facing corruption charges, the government formed an ad-hoc committee under your leadership to hold fresh elections. But the committee could not work after the members were acquitted by the court. Do you think there are some parallels between what happened then and what is happening now?
The situation was a bit different then. The CIAA had filed cases against the board members, and the ICC had frozen CAN’s accounts. My team held interactions with all stakeholders, and submitted a report to the government. The government gave us the responsibility to hold elections, and take charge of the association until elections were held. But then members went to court, and the court decided in their favour.

Were there people who said the government interfered in CAN?
Yes there were. But the ICC had sent me a note congratulating me. But my appointment was not as controversial as that of Ramesh Silwal. This shows that whoever is appointed to run cricket needs to have good managerial skills, and be financially sound. I think that when the people on the board have money, they are less likely to be corrupt.
What do you think is at the root of the problem in CAN?
I think at the root of the problem is the communication gap between CAN and the ICC. To add to that, the leadership does not have a vision. The five-year plan, which I had prepared, expired in 2010. The leadership has not been able to come up with a similar plan.
During my term in office, we would organise tournaments regularly, but it’s been three years since we had a national tourney.
CAN remains suspended. ICC has said it will interact with stakeholders in Nepal. What do you think will the ICC do next?
I am not in a position to say what they are going to do. It’s been more than four years since I stopped being in regular contact with the ICC. So I do not know what they will do. I had not imagined in my wildest dreams that Nepal would be suspended by the ICC. During my term in office, Nepal was the only Asian country poised to receive Test status. Afghanistan was there, but it did not have a robust domestic system.
Do you think the ICC showed some leniency towards Nepal when it decided to come in and organise the Nepal vs Namibia match on its own?
Yes, you are right. This is the first time that the ICC has directly gotten involved in organising a match. I am surprised that despite this level of leniency, the ICC decided to suspend CAN. It is not an easy decision for the ICC to suspend a member. In the case of the US, the dispute in their association had begun in the early 90s itself. But only after more than a decade of wrangling that the association was suspended by the ICC.
That Nepal was suspended looking at what has happened here since 2014, indicates that the level of communication between CAN and the ICC is poor.

How will the ban affect performance on the pitch?
It will definitely affect the players’ performance. If you compare our situation with the US, the US has strong club-level cricket, which we do not. In the US, the players play round the year. The suspension has not affected their domestic tournaments. But here in Nepal, players will not get to play domestic matches because we do not have club culture here; everything is association-driven.
How is the future of cricket in Nepal?
I won’t be able to say how things will fare. But I know for certain that cricket in Nepal has already reached a new height; we have already played a World Cup. Cricket is being watched and played across Nepal. The other positive is that CAN’s district-level associations are intact. There are people there who are in it for the good of the game. It would not be difficult to convince the ICC that we will improve the governance of the game, and get the suspension lifted.
What would be your role?
All I can do is give advice as a patron. I am not saying that CAN will run only if I am there. But if anyone wants to give me a role, I am willing to come back to cricket. But I should get a team of my liking. We should have people, who understand cricket. I am concerned to see a sport that I personally nurtured go bad. If anyone wants me back, I am ready for the job.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/given-right-team-i-open-leading-can-former-chief-binaya-raj-pandey.html,sports
"I have moved past criticism, says former Nepali football strongman Ganesh Thapa","Friday, April 29, 2016","
Ganesh Thapa’s name was synonymous with Nepali football for over 35 years. Having started his career as a footballer, he later became president of All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), and held the position for over three decades. Thapa, who was recently handed a 10-year ban by football’s world governing body FIFA on charges of corruption, says he is focusing on politics and social work, especially in his home district Makwanpur, these days. Thapa, who is also a member of Parliament, talked to Onlinekhabar recently about his political career (he was reluctant to talk about football on the record).
What is your daily routine like these days?
Well, I have been busy. After exiting from football, I have kept myself busy with political and social work. I spend around 15 days in a month in Makwanpur. Even when I am in Kathmandu, I frequent the ministries with local problems that need to be addressed.
Did you get into politics by choice or out of compulsion?
After separating from football, I had two options. The first option was to retire and live a life of leisure. The second one was to keep myself busy with political and social work. I chose the second option. I would not like to say it was by choice or compulsion, I would like to say what has happened had to happen sooner or later. I have faith in god, maybe god carved this path for me.
If your brother Kamal Thapa were not the party president, would it have been possible for you to get so much space within RPPN?
For anyone who has a status like me, there’s no need for anyone to do hand-holding. It’s not that I do not have ties and reach within other political parties. I could have become an MP representing a bigger party that RPPN . But I chose RPPN because only it reflects my political outlook. Because I believe in the causes of monarchy and Hindu state, there was no other party I could choose. So, there is no need to connect the dots to my brother.

You have been accused of corruption several times. Did you choose social work to absolve yourself?
As regards the corruption case, I have already received clean chit in Nepal. No one can point a finger of suspicion at me. As regards the cases outside of Nepal, I would not prefer to speak at the moment. But I am assured that time will prove that I was innocent.
In response to your question that if I had chosen politics to absolve myself, I would say that hundreds of people in Makwanpur are getting benefits from the work I do. I personally provided Rs 25,000 each to families in which one or more members died due to the quake. With my own hands, I distributed tarpaulins to hundreds of people. I made sure that five VDCs in the district had ambulances. I am even helping those people who could not afford to get treatment in Kathmandu. I am also helping rebuild temples and schools. Don’t all these things count?
So, you are preparing grounds for local support in the next election?
The next election is not on my mind now. We still have more than a year-and-a-half for election. I may not even contest. But I would be happy if the work that I have done in the district helps my party become stronger in Makwanpur. My brother is the party president as well as the country’s Deputy Prime Minister, and because of the responsibilities these jobs come with, he hasn’t had time for our own district. That was why we decided that I should oversee things at the district level, and he can concentrate on national issues.
As I spend time in the district, members of other political parties have felt the heat. That is exactly what I wanted. I want to do away with the tendency among politicians to go to their constituencies only 15 days ahead of the election. I think that there should be a competition among political parties over the work they do for their constituency. If I help build five public taps, another party should try to build 10.
You said you have helped a lot of people financially. What is the source of your funds?
I spend my own money for small things. In addition to that I am using my reach and influence to get resources. The AFC’s former President Bin Hamam and I have a close relationship. He is a billionaire. He has shown interest in the work that I do, and helped me. We will soon sign an agreement with Bin Hamam for the development of Makwanpur.
I do not spend the pay I get as an MP on my personal stuff. I hand over everything to the party, and the party spends it for the benefit of the people.
What is politician Ganesh Thapa’s ultimate goal?
I do not have any big ambition. Politics does not run in my blood the way football does. I don’t know till when I will remain in politics. But I am already in politics, and when I leave it I would want to do so by giving my role a logical conclusion. There are many people who have joined RPPN in the district because I have become the face of the party. If I leave the party, it would be akin to a betrayal.
How assured are you that monarchy will return to Nepal?
I have always been in favour of monarchy. When I was in sports, I had to suppress my political allegiance. I have been able to advocate for things I believe in ever since I entered politics.
I do not want to claim that monarchy will return or not return to Nepal, but I can say that monarchy is necessary for the country. I also do not say that all the problems facing the country will end when monarchy returns. My belief says that monarchy is needed to prevent the country from disintegrating. But monarchy in its active form may not return, if it does it will only get a ceremonial role.
In the past, I was afraid to see my brother advocate for Hindu state. But now the people themselves are talking about it. People will also start talking about monarchy in the near future.

I have not had one-to-one meetings, but I do meet him during wedding receptions.
They say that the former king has accepted that  Nepal is now a republic. So why are you worried about monarchy?
I have already said bringing back monarchy is our political line. We don’t know what the former king thinks, but monarchy is our political stand.
There was a time where you said you cannot imagine being separated from football. But the situation is such that you are no longer part of football. How painful has the experience been?
At this moment in time, I do not want to comment on football. We have a situation in which whatever I say about football would be taken negatively. But I still say that football runs in my veins, and it will continue to do so forever.
I think it would have been difficult for me to come to terms with the loss if I had taken some time off. But these days, I am wholeheartedly fulfilling my new role the same way I used to fulfill my role as ANFA president.
Did you watch Nepal’s international matches in the last few months?
Of course I did. When I say I have taken time off football, it does not mean my love for Nepali football has ended. I watched the game on TV with friends and family. I must say that watching the matches on TV, I felt the same anxiety I used to feel watching the game from up close. During every match that Nepal plays, my heart skips a beat. For someone like me who’s been associated with the game for a long time, every win that the team achieves becomes memorable. I am proud of each and every footballer.
There are many who say that Nepal’s national side started playing better after you left. What do you say to that?
Yes, I agree that during my tenure, we could not get results that were expected from us. Everyone has the freedom to analyse the situation the way they want to. But Nepal’s football was never weak. Nepal was seen as one of the top contenders during every south Asian event. We have beaten all South Asian sides, but not beaten all of them at once. There are times when I think that we had a spell of bad luck.

You must be following the conversation on social media on football in Nepal. What is your reaction to the comments people make about you?
You must understand that anyone can write anything on social media. Yes, I do read them. I say that during my lifetime I have dealt with extremes of both praise and criticism. I have received so much respect in the past, that I no longer yearn for more. The criticism that I have faced was of such a low grade one, that it has taken me past criticism.
I am waiting for my time to come. I know that those who are resorting to slander now will come to my defence in the future. For now I don’t have any answers to them.
You are writing an autobiography.
Yes I am. I am writing it to share life’s experiences. The book’s been delayed because I wanted it to be up to date on the recent turn of events.
Do you think you will ever make a comeback in football?
That would be difficult to do. Maybe it’s better if I stay away. In addition to that I am already in politics. Would it be easy to get out once you are in politics?",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/i-moved-past-criticism-says-former-nepali-football-strongman-ganesh-thapa.html,sports
TU Cricket Ground: Zee TV’s involvement and four other things you didn’t know about it,"Friday, April 15, 2016","

Nepal’s senior cricket team is playing the fifth match (third round) of the ICC’s World Cricket League Division I on Saturday. The match is going to be played at the TU cricket ground at Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur. The ground is the only one of international standard in Nepal.
The cricket ground has a history of 20 years. In 1998, Nepal became an associate member of the International Cricket Council. The same year, Nepal’s Cricket Association was awarded the right to host the ACC Trophy in Kathmandu. Two years earlier, CAN and Zee Sports, India had signed an agreement to develop the ground.
The ground was initially meant for football. Between 1996-98 CAN reached an agreement with TU to lease out the ground for five years. Zee Sports then started working on the ground, and in 1998 the ground hosted the ACC Trophy.
After the ACC trophy, Zee Sports bought broadcast rights for matches played at TU ground. It also said it was interested in building a stadium.
The first official match played on the ground was between Japan and Hong Kong October 5, 1998. This was supposed to be the third match, but the PNG vs Bangladesh match (scheduled for October 2) and the Nepal Vs Thailand match (scheduled for October 3) had been abandoned due to bad weather.
In 2001, Zee Sports organised the ‘Legend Cup’ in Kathmandu. Players such as Kapil Dev had come to town to play the match. But following the months after the match, Zee Sports stopped paying attention to Nepal, and later it entered into a merger with Ten Sports. In 2003, it received the right to broadcast the World Cup, and it lost interest in Nepal.
Although the stadium never came into being, CAN continued to extend the lease period. In 2010, CAN signed a 25-year deal with TU to allow the association to use the ground.

What’s on your mind Sharad?,"Monday, March 28, 2016","
November 27, 2013 was a historic day for Nepali cricket. On this day, the national side, for the first time ever, qualified for a cricket world cup, and one of the team’s senior batsmen established himself as the team’s ‘finisher’.
In the decider, Nepal was up against familiar rivals Hong Kong, and the match venue was Abu Dhabi. Chasing 144, Nepal was in a comfortable position to win the match, but a mini batting collapse sent the match to the wire. In the final over, Nepal needed 13 runs to win, and on the crease was Sharad Vesawker. He hit a brave six down the ground, and in the next ball, fortune favoured him. A ‘Chinese cut’ (an inside-edge) got him four runs. When the last ball of the match was being bowled the scores were level. Sharad managed to find a gap in the fortress HK had created to stop him from stealing the winning run.
For any cricket fan in Nepal, what happened next was like a fairy tale.

The fairy tale now seems to have ended (or at least gone into an intermission); the team failed to qualify for this year’s T20 World Cup.
World Cricket League Division I is where Nepal’s hopes of qualifying to the One Day World Cup rests. Nepal now face Namibia in their home ground in Kirtipur on April 16 and 18, and the team will heavily rely again on Sharad to seal crucial wins against Nambia.
“During the last few matches of the WCL, our finishing has let us down,” says team skipper Paras Khadka. “We have lost matches but the margin of our loss has been very small.” That goes for both batting and bowling, says the captain. While bowling has been team Nepal’s area of strength, batting has not been at par with it.
“In Nepal, the pitches do not favour batting. That’s why we haven’t been able to produce batsmen who can bat on fast wickets,” says Sharad. This time, however, Nepali batsmen have one huge advantage. They are playing in their home ground.
After weeks of speculation that the ICC might host the game in India (due to the dispute in Nepal’s cricket association), the ICC has just confirmed that the matches will be played in Nepal, and the governing body itself will organise it.
“After a gap of two years, we are playing an international match in Nepal. We’ve played many matches outside the country, but the kind of atmosphere we get here is different from the rest,” says Sharad.
“Of course there is more pressure to perform here. But we have always played well here. I scored my first century for the senior side, in Kirtipur itself.”
The 27-year-old says, cricket is the only thing he’s thinking about right now. What about retirement? What about future plans? “Nope, I am not thinking about any of that. I am only thinking about playing good cricket, and everything else is a distraction.”

Sarad, who made his way to the national squad through the junior sides, says his experience on and off the field has made him calm and relaxed on the field, and he’s better equipped than ever before to take on match pressure. “There are times when the opponents come out aggressively and do sledging. I remember a match in 2006 we played against Scotland. The situation was tense.”
“I was about hit one of the players with the bat.”
But now, Sharad says he understands that at the end of the day, winning is all that counts, and that is the only thing that is on his mind right now.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/whats-mind-sharad-nepals-mr-finisher-ready-namibia-challenge.html,sports
