Adventure tourism in Nepal: Regulation and safety concerns reach alarming levels,"Thursday, August 3, 2023","On July 26, Anjita Bhandari, a 22-year-old resident of Pokhara metropolitan city, went canyoning. As an adventure lover, she wanted to experience doing something new. But her harness broke, and she fell and lost her life. This was not the only adventure tourism-related death in the country in the year.
In February 2023, a woman in her 50s from Birendranagar in Surkhet, tragically died after falling from a swing at the Tree House Funpark, operated by Kankrebihar Funpark and Resort, Birendranagar-4. Two others were injured in the same incident.
In 2022, four people were injured in a Ferris Wheel accident in Pokhara while a 16-year-old boy died in a go-kart accident in February 2021.
Paragliding, which has been quite popular in Nepal, has seen its fair share of accidents too. In October 2022, Nisim Thapa, a Nepali Army paraglider, lost his life in a paragliding accident during the National Games.
Prior to this incident, there had been 16 other fatalities in paragliding accidents in the country, making a total of 17 major accidents in the one-and-a-half-decade history of commercial paragliding in Nepal. Ultralights have also been involved in multiple accidents in the region.
The above examples show no one is safe. The safety concerns surrounding adventure tourism and recreational activities in Nepal are becoming alarming. This has brought to light the inadequate regulation by both local and federal governments.
The absence of regular monitoring, and safety standards in adventure tourism activities has led to frequent occurrences of accidents in recent times. While the government does take ad-hoc steps and take action against the companies, a lack of oversight has meant these incidents continue to occur.
Experts say numerous companies offering adventure tourism activities are not adhering to essential safety standards and are lacking sufficient security measures. Consequently, accidents have been increasing, raising serious concerns among stakeholders in the industry.
The stakeholders worry that this situation could tarnish Nepal’s reputation as a safe and reliable destination for adventure enthusiasts and tourists. They feel urgent action is required to address these issues and ensure the well-being of visitors participating in such activities in Nepal.
It is clear that adventure tourism in Nepal is currently facing a concerning issue of inadequate regulation standards. Despite the Tourism Act of 1978 stipulating that these activities must obtain official permission to operate, numerous ventures are running without acquiring the necessary approvals from the department.
While certain activities may have received registration and authorisation at the local level, there are others that are operating without any formal registration, leading to a lack of oversight and potential safety concerns.
The Department of Tourism has been urging local authorities to take responsibility to ensure the safety of people indulging in adventure tourism activities. According to Hom Prasad Luitel, the Director General of the department, there is a concern that certain activities are being conducted without adhering to the necessary standards.
“It is not possible for us to go to all the places from Kathmandu and monitor,” he says. “We have asked the local level to take leadership and monitor these businesses to ensure safety.”
In 2018, tragic incidents occurred in Nepal’s rivers, with one person losing their life in a rafting accident at Chatra in Sunsari, and another fatality involving an Australian on the Karnali river. Prior to these events, there had been a history of recurrent accidents in Nepal’s rivers.
However, it is significant that since 2018 there have been no reported fatal rafting accidents on the rivers, indicating a period of improved safety measures and a decline in such unfortunate incidents.
Maniraj Lamichhane, a director at Nepal Tourism Board, stresses the negative impact that a fatal accident can have on Nepal’s tourism image, emphasising the need for stringent safety measures to avoid such incidents.
“These incidents can happen at any time as these are risky activities. But that said we can work towards making it much safer for everyone,” says Lamichhane.
In February, the Department of Tourism issued a notice and directed that all types of adventure tourism activities should be registered and operated only with a license in accordance with the Tourism Act 1978.
Rafting, paragliding, jungle riding, camping, hiking, skiing and other specified businesses were asked to undergo the mandatory registration process. Luitel says all district administration offices have been notified.
He says that the government urges adventure tourism activities like water rafting, jungle safari, trekking, and mountain climbing to be conducted through registered agencies. Even activities with local-level permission must provide detailed engineering design as instructed by the Tourism Department.
At the same time, he informs that similar instructions have been given to the recently commissioned Sky Walk Tower in Kathmandu. “This is an adventurous product that has been operated with the permission of the local level,” he says. “But we have asked for safety guarantees and engineering designs to ensure safety.”
Stakeholders in the mountaineering community are dismissing accidents as mere chance or fate. There has been a persistent call for allowing only skilled climbers in the mountains to ensure effective weather information and to prevent climbing for mere fashion or advertising purposes. Unfortunately, the government has been unable to implement such measures due to the influence of financial interests and royalties.

"Tourist arrivals cross 534,000 as Chinese tourists continue to increase","Wednesday, August 2, 2023","Kathmandu, August 1
The number of Chinese tourists coming to Nepal is gradually increasing. During the first six months of 2023, India and the US held the top positions for tourist arrivals in the country, but in July, Chinese tourists surged to the second spot.
According to Maniraj Lamichhane, the director of the Nepal Tourism Board, 57,726 tourists visited Nepal in July. Among them, 21,357 were Indian tourists, making them the largest group. Chinese citizens ranked second with 5,593 people, and American tourists were in third place with 5,561 visitors, as reported by the board.
In Nepal, June, July and August are considered lean months for tourists. This is evident by the poor number of arrivals from the US and Europe. The country, however, has seen an influx of Indian tourists during this period as many leave India to beat the heat and come to Nepal, which is a lot cooler thanks to the monsoon.
According to tourism entrepreneurs, even Chinese citizens do not pay much attention to the weather when travelling. As a result, tourism professionals believe that creating a tourism-friendly environment in Nepal could help convey the message that Nepal is a suitable destination for all seasons, appealing to Chinese tourists and others alike.
According to Youb Raj Shrestha, the treasurer of the Hotel Association of Nepal (HAN), Chinese tourists visit Nepal in large groups even during the off-season, which benefits local businesses. Meanwhile, businesspersons note that Indian tourists particularly enjoy the food offerings in Nepal.
Furthermore, Chinese tourists show a preference for travelling, shopping, and participating in tourism activities, ensuring that adventure tourism activities thrive even during the off-season.
The number of tourist arrivals for 2023 has reached 534,207 as of July 31.

SC issues interim order to not implement VAT on air ticket,"Monday, July 31, 2023","Kathmandu, July 31
The Supreme Court issued an interim order on Sunday, asking the government to not implement value-added tax (VAT) on air tickets.
The court issued such an order in response to a writ petition filed by the Nepal Association of Tours and Travels Agent (NATTA).
A single bench of Justice Anil Kumar Singha issued the order and also summoned the government side for discussion.
NATTA had moved the SC on July 17, seeking mandamus with certiorari against the government’s decision to impose VAT on air tickets.
In the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2023/24, Finance Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat announced the implementation of VAT on air tickets.
Tourism entrepreneurs are concerned about the negative impact of the newly imposed VAT on air tickets, as it could adversely affect the tourism business. The burden of this tax is expected to be borne by both travel companies and passengers, as stated by NATTA.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sc-vat-on-air-ticket.html,travel
Nepal’s struggle with unorganised and unstable public transportation crowds,"Monday, July 31, 2023","In the bustling city of Kathmandu, navigating through the chaotic streets has become a daily adventure for residents. From cramped buses to jam-packed microbuses, the struggle to secure a spot onboard becomes an art in itself.
Passengers eagerly wait at designated stops, bracing themselves for the battle of finding a seat or even a comfortable standing spot. Amidst the chaotic scenes, it becomes evident that the existing public transportation system is strained beyond its capacity.
If you live in Nepal, it is highly probable that you have encountered challenges while travelling in public vehicles, especially on the roads of Kathmandu.
The morning and evening hours are notorious for being the busiest and most crowded for buses. The situation becomes more concerning as, despite the people’s safety and capacity limits of the vehicles, conductors often command passengers to shift and accommodate additional people inside.
This practice leaves no proper space for standing, leading to overcrowding conditions within the vehicle. Consequently, conflicts and arguments frequently arise between conductors and passengers, further exacerbating the unsafe and unfriendly environment.
Moreover, it poses a significant risk to the safety and well-being of passengers. The tightly packed space increases the risk of suffocation, physical harm, and even incidents of theft or robbery. Many individuals have experienced the unfortunate loss of their phones while travelling on buses. These conditions create an environment that compromises the security and comfort of passengers.
Additionally, this unmanaged and overcrowded state of public transportation has been identified as one of the main contributors to the rapid spread of Covid 19 in Nepal in recent years. The close proximity among passengers, lack of ventilation, and the difficulty of maintaining physical distancing all contribute to the increased transmission of the virus within these settings. This highlights the urgent need for improved crowd management and adherence to safety protocols in public vehicles.

The unmanaged and unmaintained condition of roads has created a significant safety concern for passengers. The poor state of many roads, particularly in remote areas, poses risks to travellers.
Due to inadequate maintenance, many roads suffer from potholes and uneven surfaces. The improper tarmacking of roads contributes to an increase in pollution levels, causing breathing problems for the people around. These road conditions can cause discomfort to passengers, but more importantly, they increase the risk of accidents.
Moreover, the number of public vehicles is insufficient compared to the demand from the population. As a result, people often have to endure long waiting times to catch a bus. The scarcity of buses not only causes delays in reaching workplaces and schools but also exacerbates the issue of overcrowding when buses finally arrive due to the high number of people waiting.
Many have witnessed people not properly following the laws of public vehicle seats. The lack of adherence to proper seating laws by some citizens remains a concerning issue. Despite the clear designation of seats for women at the top of buses, it is disheartening to witness men occupying these seats, disregarding the established rules and showing a lack of respect for women’s rights in these designated spaces.
It is important for individuals to show empathy and respect towards those in need and offer a seat, particularly to individuals with younger children and the elderly. By doing so, they demonstrate consideration for the well-being and dignity of fellow passengers who may require seating for reasons of safety, comfort, or mobility.
Promoting awareness campaigns that emphasize the importance of following seating regulations, respecting designated spaces for women, and encouraging acts of courtesy towards those who require priority seating can contribute to a more inclusive and considerate public transportation system. Additionally, transportation policies and authorities can play an active role by inspecting regular checks and enforcing these regulations and providing training to bus conductors and staff on promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful atmosphere within public vehicles.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-poor-public-transportation.html,travel

"There are problems with the TIMS card in Nepal, but it is time stakeholders sought solutions to improve it","Wednesday, July 26, 2023","I am a regular traveller and trekking enthusiast who has been relishing high-altitude adventures around Nepal’s Himalayas for a long time. I have been observing the TIMS implementation in Nepal’s three main regions, Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang, and how there is a gap in the understanding between operators, customers and the government.
TIMS (Trekker’s Information Management System) card is a basic trekking permit that trekkers need to acquire before their exploration of the glorious Himalayan regions, mainly Everest, Annapurna and Langtang.
The Nepal Tourism Board revised the TIMS provision, making it a mandatory permit for mainstream trekking routes in Nepal, like Everest, Annapurna and Langtang region, including a few others.
The fee for this mandatory trekking permit costs NPR 1,000 for SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) citizens and NPR 2,000 for residents of other countries.
Although some experts saw this decision as a restriction on the free movement of trekkers that could potentially be counter-productive for the growth of the tourism industry in the country. This joint initiative of both the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB)  and the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) aims to strengthen the safety and easy accessibility factors for all trekkers.
Every year 10- 15 trekkers go missing during their journey in the Himalayas, especially trekkers from the FITs (Free Independent Trekkers) category, and it has become a major concern in recent years. In 2022 alone, two South Korean tourists lost their lives during their trekking adventure in the Himalayas.
Thus, with the implementation of this policy, the Nepali authority aims to boost the confidence of the trekkers as the TIMS card will make the search and rescue of the trekkers more convenient and effective. Plus, it will ensure the protection of the assets and belongings trekkers take with them in their exploration.
The government making the TIMS cards mandatory has also received mixed reactions from the trekkers; some have complained it has restricted their freedom; meanwhile, others have applauded the decision that has added safety factors to the Himalayan exploration.
TIMS card maintains the data of the trekkers along the route in the computerised database management system, boosting safety and security factors. At the same time, it also controls the unauthorised trekking operations that have been jeopardising the local business and even putting the trekkers at risk.
This will significantly improve the overall management of the trekking service in the country, which will benefit not only the field staff but also the tour operators and government agencies. Furthermore, this policy also promotes the local authorised services, which certainly contribute to the economy of the country, paving the path for better management and sustainability of the mountain tourism development in the country.
The trekkers under the FITs (Free Independent Trekkers) category are especially unhappy about the new policy set by the Nepali authority. Independent trekkers see the decision as a restriction to their movement for their solo adventure of the Himalayas.
Independent travellers prefer to plan trips on their own and especially like to avoid hiring staff from an agency. Their major concern is that this new policy adheres to the added expenses on their budget-friendly adventures. On top of that, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation has set fines for trekkers who don’t have TIMS cards for their expeditions.
Trekkers on the adventure without a TIMS card and a guide will be banned from the trek and liable for a Rs 12,000 fine. Similarly, the trekking company which sends trekkers without TIMS cards will be fined Rs 10,000 and will have to get a TIMS card for each of the expedition members.
The mandatory use of the TIMS card ensured the safety of the trekkers at the same time minimising the probable risk factors during the expedition. It also guarantees the facilities and services of the guide expedition that doesn’t just emphasise the trekkers but their properties as well.
According to Madhav Prasad, co-founder of Mosaic Adventure, TIMS is a highly significant tool implemented by the government of Nepal, benefiting trekkers, tour operators, and the country’s revenue generation. It stands as one of the finest measures for promoting the sustainable development of trekking trails, earning admiration from both local communities and trek operators.
Prasad further suggests that if the government intends to discourage independent trekkers, they could consider increasing the cost of the entry permit to a higher value, such as USD 500/600, while also enhancing safety measures along the trails.
This approach would allow solo trekkers the freedom they desire while ensuring that those not trekking solo to save money have no issue paying the additional charges. This, he believes, is a more reasonable solution than obliging everyone to book a tour through an operator, which might not align with the preferences of individuals seeking an independent trekking experience.”
I was returning from Everest Base Camp Trek and asked a fellow traveller who used the TIMS card during their adventure, complaining about not finding any specific use or benefits of the permit along the route.
“I paid approximately USD 20 for the TIMS card, but despite spending that amount, I have not come across anyone actually checking it during my trek. Moreover, it doesn’t seem like a good idea to make it mandatory without providing a proper reason behind its implementation,” said Adam Mangin, a fellow trekker I met on the Everest trail.
But it is apparent that some see the true importance of this policy for high-altitude adventures. Patricia Wynne, the mother of Julian Wayne, a British trekking tourist who went missing in December 2008 during his solo adventure, speaking about the new policy, says if it were made mandatory back then, her son would probably be with her today.
Nepal’s government must adhere to these rising mixed concerns about the new mandatory TIMS policy and resolve it with tourists and operators finding a sustaining common ground.
Although the government has implemented a mandatory TIMS card, it is not being properly implemented locally on the field. Annapurna and Langtang regions inconsistently ask for TIMS, but in Everest, locals have kind of boycotted the TIMS system, and they have their own system of Khumbu GauPalika card.
I believe it is crucial for all stakeholders in the tourism industry to collaborate and reach a consensus on implementing a more systematic TIMS (Trekkers’ Information Management System). This approach should aim to benefit trekkers, locals, and tour operators and generate revenue for the Nepali government.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tims-card-pros-cons-nepal.html,travel

Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort concludes soft opening,"Monday, July 24, 2023","Kathmandu, July 24
Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort held its soft opening launch at its Dhulikhel premises on Monday. Nestled amidst the lush green landscape of Dhulikhel, the newly constructed resort is spread across a total area of 7.92 acres.
The hotel was inaugurated by Manusavee Monsakul, charge d’ affairs of the Royal Thai Embassy.
Various dignitaries like the CEO of Dusit International, Suphajee Suthumpun, and member of the House of Representatives Swarnim Wagle, also attended the launch of the newest luxury resort in the country.
The brains behind the resort, Ramesh Hamal said he envisioned Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort when he returned from Thailand in 2013 after spending 19 years in South East Asia’s tourism hub. Eager to make a meaningful impact, he began exploring opportunities that could significantly benefit the country’s economy.
“After conducting thorough research, I realised that tourism had a tremendous opportunity for the country. Encouraged by this insight, I began consulting with like-minded individuals,” says Hamal who then came to the conclusion of building a luxury resort.
Hamal said the resort currently has 28 rooms and 18 villas. He further said that 26 more rooms will be added by 2024. The resort also features a variety of amenities, including an all-day-dining restaurant, a bar and lobby lounge, meeting facilities, and a swimming pool.
The resort’s architectural inspiration came from a Thai architect, and the design was prepared by seven Thai designers.
“It took hard work but we are finally here. Our dream has become a reality,” he said.
Hamal also thanked co-owner Monty More for his support in building Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort and shared how he had to explore to find land fit enough for a luxurious property.
“We looked at Pokhara too but then I found this place. The beauty of the place along with the panoramic view of the mountains and the morning sunrise captivated me. The road wasn’t great but then I did not want to build this anywhere else,” he said.
In 2017, the involved parties officially signed an agreement to commence the construction of the resort, solidifying their commitment to the project.
Speaking at the event Monsakul, charge d’ affairs of the Royal Thai Embassy, said Nepal and Thailand have always had cordial relationships and it was great to see such a collaboration between the two countries.
“I believe people will get to experience Thai-inspired hospitality with Nepali charm. The best of both worlds,” she said.
During the programme, Hamal emphasised that the resort’s impact goes beyond providing a delightful experience for visitors.
“It will also play a crucial role in boosting the local economy by creating employment opportunities for the local community,” he said.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dusit-thani-himalayan-resort.html,travel
Tickets prices to go up as govt imposes VAT on air tickets,"Sunday, July 16, 2023","Kathmandu, July 16
The government imposing value-added tax (VAT) on air tickets from fiscal year 2023/24 will increase the price of tickets by 6 per cent.
Sources say all companies affiliated with the Airline Operators Association of Nepal are registering themselves on VAT as per government orders.
The government charged 13 per cent as VAT on goods and services.
Earlier, VAT was not charged on air tickets. That is why it was not mandatory for companies to register for VAT. Now all companies have to be registered for VAT.
According to Yeti Airlines spokesperson Sudarshan Barteula, the implementation of VAT on air tickets will increase air ticket prices by only 6 per cent.
He believes the price hike will not be significant as the companies can reclaim the VAT paid on the purchase of aviation fuel, office supplies and equipment.
On the other hand, there is still confusion if the VAT should be imposed on international tickets as travel agents believe this will drive away their business as people will choose to buy tickets from intentional agents.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tickets-price-imposes-vat-on-air-tickets.html,travel

CAAN bans non-essential helicopter flights to mountainous areas during monsoon,"Thursday, July 13, 2023","Kathmandu, July 13
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has brought in new rules for helicopter companies.
According to the new rule, helicopters will not be allowed to fly in the mountain regions during the monsoon as CAAN has banned all non-essential flights and mountain flights until September.
The authority has implemented a new regulation specifying that helicopters must have at least one airport as either the departure or landing point in order to be permitted to fly.
Helicopter companies will have to take permission from CAAN if it wants to fly to non-designated destination until September.
The authority is forming a committee to conduct regular supervision of daily flights to smaller airports in the hilly areas of Nepal.
CAAN has also banned pilots who are also owners (or investors) of a helicopter company from flying.
The decision comes after a Manang Air helicopter crashed in Solukhumbu on Tuesday.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/caan-bans-helicopter-flight-monsoon.html,travel
"Deemed to be safe internationally, why are helicopter crashes so common in Nepal?","Wednesday, July 12, 2023","Due to the ever-changing weather and mountainous terrain, the Nepali airspace is perceived as highly hazardous, posing risks not only to aeroplanes but also to helicopters. Manang Air helicopter crashing in the hills of eastern Nepal is proof of that as it became the 42nd helicopter crash in the country’s history.
It is unclear how the helicopter crashed as there are reports the pilot was told the weather was clear between Solukhumbu and Kathmandu. But the helicopter crashed a few minutes after flying bringing an old but serious question to light.
Why do helicopters, that are considered safe in international airspace, crash in Nepal so often?
The Manang Air helicopter left Sukre for Kathmandu at 10.15 am. Authorities say it came into contact with the air traffic controller in Lukla at 10.13 am. By this time, the helicopter was at Lamjura Pass. After that, Kathmandu’s air traffic controller should have contacted this helicopter, but it did not.
According to Pratap Babu Tiwari, General Manager of Tribhuvan International Airport, after the helicopter did not come into contact with the tower, the Search and Rescue Center at TIA dispatched two Altitude Air helicopters to look for the missing chopper.
Locally, the police were also on the lookout. Assistant Police Inspector Nirajan Basnet, the frist respondent to the scene, says there was a lot of commotion around the spot. The helicopter had crashed and it was unlikely there would be any survivors.
There were six people on the helicopter. Five of the six were Mexican tourists and they were flown by experienced pilot CB Gurung. They were in Lukla on Monday and had taken the mountain flight to get a glimpse of the highest mountains in the world. Little did they know, that their flight back was going to be their last.
While the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has been claiming that the Nepali skies are safe, regular accidents prove otherwise.
In 2023, there have been four helicopter accidents where seven people died. If you take the Yeti Airlines crash into account, five incidents have happened in the space of little over six months in the country.
Former Director General of CAAN Rajesh Raj Dali says that a serious analysis should be done regarding the frequent helicopter crashes in the country.
“You need to follow international rules when flying a helicopter,” he said. “It is time we carefully monitor if companies are abiding by these rules or not.”
Helicopters have become an effective means of transportation to go to travel to remote areas in Nepal. They are used to pick and drop off tourists along with being used in rescue missions. On top of that, they are also used for the transportation of goods to these areas. During tourist and mountaineering season, the number of flights is significantly high. Their line of work is quite broad.
Despite the growing usage of helicopters in Nepal, there is currently no established system in place to provide accurate weather and geographical information to the helicopters that fly at low altitudes. In certain situations, pilots have to depend on information from other helicopters.
This is particularly risky when flying over hilly terrains, as pilots must rely on visual cues to navigate, which can be significantly challenging during adverse weather conditions.
In numerous instances, helicopters are required to land in areas lacking designated helipads. While improving existing helipads could contribute to reduced crashes, unfortunately, this aspect has not received sufficient attention.
Additionally, there have been instances where pilot performance and oversight by the helicopter company have been identified as areas of concern in helicopter flights.
Companies and pilots have disregarded air traffic control instructions and have flown in foggy conditions, at low altitudes with more than the maximum load capacity.
The majority of crash studies have indicated that pilots attempting to navigate adverse weather conditions have been a significant factor leading to an increased number of accidents.
CAAN has been taking action against pilots. On March 23, pilots of Fishtail Air, Air Dynasty and Annapurna Helicopter were punished for breaching air safety standards.
On April 27, Altitude Air’s senior captain and maintenance manager were suspended indefinitely. They were suspended for not undertaking regular checks before and after flights.
In a notable incident last January, a helicopter travelling from Pokhara to Waling in Syangja landed on a football pitch while the game was still going on. The pilot and the passengers were physically assaulted. The authorities took disciplinary action against the pilot in response to this incident.
Furthermore, an official from the authority has observed a concerning trend where experienced pilots are more frequently involved in accidents. This suggests that accidents may have increased due to pilots taking unwarranted risks driven by overconfidence.
That carelessness and overconfidence coupled with the geography and weather have led to 42 helicopter crashes and the deaths of 104 people. CAAN data says the first helicopter accident in Nepal happened in 1979 in Langtang when VVIP Helicopter crashed killing six on board.
In 1997, a Karnali Air helicopter crashed in Thupten Choling, killing one person. In another accident in Mulkharka in 1998, three people died.
In 2002, 11 people aboard an Asian Air helicopter died in Solukhumbu. In 2003, a Fishtail helicopter crashed in Rara Lake, killing 4 people. In the same year, a Simrik Air helicopter crashed at Everest base camp, killing 2 people.
In 2005, three people lost their lives when a Heli Hans helicopter crashed in Ramechhap.
In 2006, the biggest helicopter crash happened. Forest State Minister Gopal Rai along with conservationist Harka Gurung were on board when a Shree Airlines helicopter crashed in Taplejung, killing 24 people. Conservationists mourn this day even today.
In 2010, two people lost their lives when a Fishtail Air helicopter crashed in Ama Dablam mountain. Helicopter crashes in 2013 and 2014 in Simikot and Sindupalchowk respectively resulted in the death of two people. In 2015, a Mountain Heli helicopter crashed on Yamuna Hill in Sindhupalchowk, killing four people.
Similarly, in 2015, 13 people, including American soldiers, lost their lives when an American army helicopter that went to the rescue of earthquake victims crashed in Dolakha. Again in 2016, seven people died when a Fishtail helicopter crashed in Nuwakot.
In 2018, a Manang Air helicopter crashed in Hilsa, killing one person. In the same year, six people died on the spot when Altitude Air’s helicopter crashed in Nuwakot.
In 2019, Minister of Tourism Rabindra Adhikari died when the helicopter he was on crashed in Taplejung. He was flying with tourism entrepreneur Ang Tsering Sherpa, PMO under-secretary Yubaraj Dahal, officials from CAAN Birendra Shrestha and Dhurva Bhochhibhya, security personnel Arjun Ghimire and pilot Prabhakar KC.
The inquiry commissions established following helicopter accidents have commonly identified several key factors as the main causes. These factors include the challenging geographical terrain of Nepal, the swiftly changing weather conditions, and the tendency of pilots to fly irrespective of unfavourable weather and terrain. These elements have consistently been recognised as significant contributors to helicopter accidents in the country.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-helicopter-crash-nepal.html,travel

Tourism industry in Nepal: Trends and challenges in the present era,"Saturday, June 24, 2023","The tourism industry in Nepal is the fourth largest job creator in the country as it employs 371,140 people according to an analytical report by Central Bureau Statistics.
Clearly, the tourism sector has been significantly impacted by the adverse effects of the Covid pandemic, leading to the failure of the ‘Visit Nepal 2020’ campaign. That was seen in the numbers as the number of foreign visitors to the country dropped by 80 per cent in 2020, the lowest in 34 years.
Things are gradually improving and the country is getting more tourists. In 2023, the government has set a target of attracting one million tourists. Recent data from the Central European International Cup (CEIC) indicates a gradual rise in tourist numbers. In March 2023, Nepal welcomed 99,426 tourists, compared to 73,225 visitors in the previous month.
The tourism industry in Nepal plays a vital role in bolstering the country’s economy. It serves as a potential source of foreign exchange and contributing to increased government revenue. To address the challenges in this sector, it is crucial for the country to comprehend the prevailing trends in the tourism industry and proactively undertake initiatives to enhance and upgrade the industry accordingly.
Nepal is a country with diverse geographical terrain and no other country can beat the diversity found in its natural beauty. Not only that Nepal, is rich in culture and tradition, which can provide tourists with adequate opportunities to immerse themself in the local lifestyle.
Likewise, the country itself is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, where all these heritage sites provide a glance at Nepal’s history, art, and architecture. Also known for its vibrant festival celebration, visitors can witness and know about the traditional rituals along with its beliefs.
Moreover, there are various adventurous activities such as trekking, rafting, bungee jumping, canoeing and paragliding that can attract tourists to Nepal making it a destination for those who want to indulge themselves in adventure sports.
However, the adventure tourism industry in Nepal is not free from challenges. With the potential of adventure sports in Nepal, Nepal should be prepared for the unfortunate consequences that happen sometime in this field.
As such Nepal has to focus on the safety of the tourists and there is a need for better safety and security measures for tourists, which includes rescue operations, and exceptional infrastructure for emergency services as well.
Tourism is a significant source of income for the country, and the safety of tourists can significantly impact the tourism industry in Nepal where ensuring the safety of tourists is pivotal for the country’s continued growth and development.
Moreover, it is very important for the government to take action against fraud cases. The videos spreading on social media clearly reflect the unusual activity shown by locals to foreigners. The trend of overpricing is increasing on certain things, which adversely affects the flourishing sector of tourism. Therefore, it’s important to take action against those people by concerned authorities so that no problem shall arise against this.
Then, the government should focus on the transportation system if it wants to bring in more tourists. Travelling from one place to another should be hassle-free for the tourists.
The lack of promotion and marketing efforts for lesser-known tourist destinations has resulted in tourists not being aware of the attractive places in Nepal. It is important to develop a comprehensive strategy for the promotion and marketing of these destinations.
By implementing effective promotional campaigns and marketing initiatives, the country can increase awareness among tourists and showcase the diverse and appealing attractions it has to offer.
Lekhnath Chamber of Commerce and Industry in collaboration with the Begnas Lake Boat Entrepreneurs’ Committee and the fisheries has taken the initiative to conserve and promote Begnas lake through various activities around it. The visitors’ flow is low in Begnas lake in comparison to Phewa lake despite its beauty and allure.
Each place offers a multiple ranges of explorations and various backgrounds to individuals. Another important aspect, while promoting the place to visit, is to note the maintenance of the environment. Several attractive places surrounding are degrading day by day due to the activities of visitors.
So, it is important to maintain a sustained environment that enchants the traveller such as the implication of a cleaning campaign at the destination for better sustenance.
Overall, the tourism industry in Nepal is playing a vital role in country’s economy as it is providing employment opportunities, demonstrating the natural beauty and bring forign currency into the country. So it is important for the government to make proper plans and policies to ensure that the tourism industry in the country can flourish in a better way, which is beneficial to all.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tourism-industry-in-nepal-challenges.html,travel

All long and medium-distance buses to leave from Gongabu Bus Park,"Friday, June 16, 2023","Kathmandu, June 16
Starting today, all long and medium-distance vehicles departing from Kathmandu will have to do from the Gongabu Bus Park.
According to Jagat Man Shrestha, the traffic consultant of Kathmandu metropolitan city, the city is planning to introduce a one-bus station system in Kathmandu starting from June 16. Under this system, all buses will have to exit from Gongabu Bus Park.
“We held a meeting on Thursday with the transport operators who are in unison with us,” said Shrestha. “We will start monitoring to ensure it is implemented.”
Shrestha further mentioned that as part of the implementation process, ticket counters and hoarding boards within the metropolis will be removed.
“A task force has also been formed to study whether passengers can be picked up and dropped off safely in areas other than the bus park,” said Shrestha who leads the task force.
The primary objective of the metropolis is to alleviate traffic congestion. In the past, transport operators had the freedom to operate buses from any location they desired.

Bote Community Homestay: Empowering locals and mitigating human-wildlife conflict one guest at a time,"Sunday, June 11, 2023","Rita Bote of Madi municipality in Chitwan is busy operating a homestay her the village these days. With the establishment of the Bote Community Homestay in the village back in 2020, the daily routine of women like Rita has undergone a remarkable transformation.
During the peak tourist season, women like her are fully occupied as they have to manage rooms, cook food and ensure the guests who come to the Bote Community Homestay are taken care of well.
“Life was very different before. Our life has completely changed thanks to Bote Community Homestay,” says Rita who says they can afford things they could only dream of.
The homestay project has been a boon to the Bote community. It has helped families send children to school and enhanced their life as many are even paying off debts through the money they make from the homestay.
Before the implementation of the homestay concept, women in this community were engaged in activities such as fishing, gathering grass and firewood from the forest, and foraging for food.
Take Phool Maya Bhote for example. At 50, she is running the homestay smoothly and is reaping the rewards as she is finally financially sustainable.
“The income generated from the homestay has made it much easier for me to send my children to school and run the household,” says Phool Maya.
Bote Community Homestay can be reached by crossing the Riu River in Madi and travelling about 1.5 kilometres west from the Seruwa gate on the main road. The homestay has been built with financial support from Madi municipality, the Panch Pandav Buffer Zone Users Group, and the Terai Arc Landscape Project (TAL).
A cosy two-room homestay has been constructed for around Rs 1 million. Currently, the Bote Community Homestay project comprises 12 homestays, providing accommodation for a total of 60 people.
The locals at the Bote Community Homestay extend a warm welcome to tourists, embracing their cultural traditions. Following the Bote community’s practice of Binti Bati, which involves showing respect to older dignitaries and guests, the hosts’ place tika (a vermillion mark) on the foreheads of the guests and offer them flowers. Subsequently, the guests are guided to a community building constructed using bamboo.
As the Bote community sustains their livelihood through fishing, they welcome guests by offering fish chokha (pickle) and chhyang (local alcoholic beverage). The cost for a one-night stay at a homestay is Rs 600, with an additional Rs 300 for food, which includes meat dishes. This is worth it as guests are treated to an array of culinary delights, including various duck items and local ethnic dishes such as pickled fish, ghongi (snail), and bamboo shoot chokha.
Following the delightful culinary experience, the guests are treated to captivating cultural programs that showcase the rich traditions of the Bote community. These programs at Bote Community Homestay feature enchanting local dances and melodious songs, providing a glimpse into their vibrant and traditional culture.
A specialised team of around 20 individuals has been assembled to entertain the guests with captivating cultural performances. To witness these cultural programs, a group is required to pay a fee of Rs 3,000. Jag Narayan Bote, the treasurer of Bote Community Homestay, highlights the significance of these activities in safeguarding the endangered Bote culture in the area.
The homestays provide an opportunity for guests to embark on tours to nearby attractions. These include visits to the Gorakhnath Temple, which is just 500 meters away from the homestay, the Panch Pandav Temple located 1 kilometer away, the Ashta Shiva Linga at a distance of 1.5 kilometers and the Parashuram Kund, which is 4 kilometers away.
The operation of the homestays has sparked a commercialisation trend among the locals, who have ventured into chicken, duck, goat, and fish farming, in addition to vegetable cultivation.
To facilitate financial support for these ventures, village groups have been formed to collect funds, and loans are provided at a six per cent interest rate to aspiring entrepreneurs.
“This initiative has proven beneficial in avoiding the pitfalls of microfinance”, says Prem Paudel programme coordinator of Bote Community Homestay.
According to Narayan Sapkota, the president of the Panch Pandav User Group, while the Bote caste has previously been involved in running homestays alongside other castes, this particular homestay is the first one exclusively operated by the Bote community.
Sapkota, serving as both the president of the Panch Pandav Buffer Zone Users Group and the president of the group itself, highlights that the homestay has received support from the group in the form of furniture, home decor items and water tank stands.
Paudel mentioned that the Terai Arc Landscape Project (TAL) has extended financial support to each homestay, providing assistance of Rs 25,000 to facilitate their operational activities.
“TAL has played a crucial role in forming groups, organizing homestay training programs, and supporting income generation initiatives for the local community. Their assistance has been instrumental in empowering the locals to establish and operate successful homestays, contributing to sustainable economic growth in the region,” says Paudel.
Over that last two year, Bote Community Homestay has successfully hosted more than 5,000 tourists, comprising both local and foreigners. These individuals have chosen the homestay as their preferred destination to partake in the genuine warmth of the community’s hospitality and engage in an immersive experience of the local culture. With its rising popularity, the homestay has emerged as a sought-after choice for travelers seeking an authentic and enriching sojourn in the region.
“Each homestay made over Rs 500,000 in the past two years,” says Jag Narayan, the homestay’s treasurer.
The Bote community, residing in close proximity to Chitwan National Park, has been facing issues with wildlife. The settlement frequently experiences crop damage and destruction caused by wild animals.
Tragically, incidents have occurred where these animals have harmed individuals and even claimed lives, leading to a surge in conflicts between humans and wildlife. The escalating encounters underscore the challenges faced by the community in coexisting with the natural habitat of the park.
According to Sapkota, the introduction of the homestay concept was aimed at mitigating the growing human-wildlife conflict. By providing alternative economic opportunities and promoting tourism, the homestay initiative seeks to reduce the pressure on the surrounding natural habitat and minimize the frequency of conflicts between the local community and wildlife as people do not enter the forest as much.
“We have been successful to an extent. The homestay has also helped in the preservation and revival of the lost culture of the Bote community,” says Sapkota.
The operation of the homestay has not only brought economic benefits but has also contributed to the development of leadership skills and capacities among local women.
Sapkota highlights the transformative impact, noting that previously, the women would shy away and hide when encountering new individuals in the village. However, with their involvement in the homestay activities, they have gained confidence and now actively engage in conversations and extend warm welcomes to guests, showcasing their enhanced communication and hospitality skills.
The women here are now involved in forest and wildlife conservation campaigns too. A few years ago, Rita’s father-in-law Shukra Bahadur Bote was attacked by a rhinoceros and got seriously injured. A large amount of money was also spent on his treatment.
But Rita has no grudge towards wild animals including rhinoceros. She has started the rhino conservation campaign herself.
“There is hardly a house in this area that has not been victimised by wild animals, but they have helped in conservation,” says Prakash Dhungana, chairperson of the Buffer Zone Management Committee, “After reducing the dependence on the forest, conflicts have also decreased.”

Experiencing Everest one activity at a time: Here are 3 options you have,"Friday, June 2, 2023","Nepalis are proud of Mount Everest. Why would not they be? It is the highest mountain in the world and it is in Nepal. That said, how many of you have experienced Everest and its grandeur? How many of you have been close to the mountain or even seen it? The answer is not many.
The sheer size of Everest makes it a natural wonder, and conquering Everest is regarded as the pinnacle of human achievement. Reaching the summit of Everest symbolises the indomitable human spirit but getting to its base camp is also a great achievement.
The mountain is a marvel of nature, and Nepal’s tourism industry believes everyone should experience Everest at least once in their lifetime.
There are different ways of doing so as the experience can depend based on a tourist’s preference, determination, age, fitness, health, and budget.
Here, we bring you a few ways how you can experience the highest mountain in the world:
If you want to see Everest from afar and do not want to trek up to the base of the mountain, here are your options:
The best and easiest way to get close to Everest is to take a mountain flight from Kathmandu. Several airlines carry out these flights daily that will take you close to the mountains of Nepal, especially Everest.
These flights start as early as 6 am to ensure there are no turbulences and clouds. These flights do not come cheap and can cost up to USD 200. But that said, if you want to avoid exhaustion and only see a bird’s eye view of Everest and the region, this option is for you.
If you want a more personal experience, tour companies in Nepal offer helicopter tours to the region. These tours are flexible as you can stop anywhere you please like at Everest base camp, Kala Pathar or even the Gokyo Lakes.
These tours last from one day to 10 days and are quite expensive. But for the price you pay, you do get an intimate experience with Nepal and its mountains.
If you do not want to fly and want to trek in high altitude, this is for you. This trek will take you lower points from where you can experience Everest.
You can do so by going to Pikey Peak or you can to the Khumbu region and experience Sherpa villages like Tengboche, Namche Bazar or Khumjung and witness Everest in its glory.
If you have an average physique and are active, you can choose to trek to the Everest base camp. However, it is advised to prepare by participating in stamina-building exercises such as cycling and swimming a few weeks before your trek departure date.
The trek starts from Lukla and goes past Sherpa villages like Phakding, Monjo, Namche Bazar, and Khumjung before leading towards the highest mountain in the world. You also get to witness centuries-old monasteries in Tengboche and Pangboche.
The trail to the Everest base camp is impressive and well managed with good lodges along the way. The views are magnificent as you are surrounded by mountains on all sides.
But there are different ways to experience trekking in the Everest reason. Here are some options:
This is the most common and well-established route to the base camp. The journey begins with a short flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, followed by a trek through Namche Bazar, Tengboche, Dingboche, and Lobuche.
The trail passes through picturesque landscapes, rhododendron forests, and suspension bridges while offering stunning views of the highest mountain in the world and its neighbouring peaks.
Those seeking to trek to the base camp without flying to Lukla can take the traditional route via Jiri used by tourists and mountaineers before Lukla Airport was built. The journey starts from Jiri, a small town west of the Everest region, and continues up to the traditional route as it connects to Lukla. Even though it is a bit longer, the trek gives tourists a better experience and takes them back in time.
This trek takes you to both the EBC and the beauty of the Gokyo lake region. From Lukla, the trail diverges from the main route at Namche Bazar and leads to the stunning Gokyo valley.
Trekking through this area offers breathtaking views of pristine lakes, glaciers, and towering peaks, including Cho Oyu. After visiting Gokyo, trekkers cross the Cho La Pass and rejoin the classic trail to the EBC. Make sure to look for danphes and ghorals.
The three-pass trek is the most challenging trek around the Khumbu region and is only for those looking for a challenge. This trail traverses through three high mountain passes: Kongma La, Cho La, and Renjo La. Along the way, you will pass through the popular Sherpa villages of Dingboche, Lobuche, Gokyo, and Namche Bazaar, offering breathtaking views and an opportunity to explore remote valleys and glacial lakes.
All of these treks come with unique experiences. To choose a perfect trek, you should consider your trek experience, time available, fitness level, and personal preferences.
Only a few and those in their finest mental and physical shape can undertake this daunting task, and even those need months of training to prepare for the climb.
Climbing Everest is the ultimate mountaineering challenge. It demands human strength, determination, and endurance. Reaching the summit requires meticulous planning, extensive training, unwavering commitment, and enough funds.
As a climber, you must face extreme weather conditions, treacherous icefalls, dangerous crevasses, and altitude-related illnesses.
The ascent to Everest tests your physical and mental fortitude. Yet, the reward you experience at the summit is beyond words—the breathtaking panoramic view, the sense of achievement, and the overwhelming realization of standing atop the world.
These are the ways you can experience Mount Everest. We believe all Nepalis should see Mount Everest at least once in their lifetimes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/experiencing-everest-nepal.html,travel
Everest 2023: Death toll reaching highest ever as 13 dead and four missing,"Wednesday, May 31, 2023","Kathmandu, May 31

What are the most iconic Everest climbs in 70 years of history,"Monday, May 29, 2023","Seventy years ago today, Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary stood on top of the summit of Everest. This became major news across the world as human beings finally stood on top of the world. As humans had yet to go to the moon in 1953, this achievement was something close to it and was celebrated everywhere in the world.
Since then, a thousand others have reached the summit of the mountain, and many of them are iconic Everest climbs.
Until the 90s, climbing Everest was seen as a matter of national pride, but over the course of the past two decades, things have changed as commercial climbing has changed mountaineering as you know it.
People now use helicopters to skip climbing through the Khumbu Icefall while Sherpa support and oxygen use has been rampant. Many say the true essence of mountaineering, especially on Everest, is lost but over the course of history, you have seen some great and iconic Everest climbs that have defined mountaineering not just in Nepal but the world.
Today, on the occasion of Everest Day, we look back at some of the best and most iconic Everest climbs that have inspired a generation of climbers to go out and do the impossible.
Climbing Everest without using supplementary oxygen is seen as a big deal even today. So when Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler first put this idea of such an iconic Everest climb out there in 1978, they were told they were mad. Scientists had told them they would not survive so high in the mountain where the air was thin. But the two defied all odds as they reached the summit without the use of oxygen becoming the first to do so. It was not easy as they talk about being hallucinated and not being able to speak or think straight. It was an amazing feat, one that not only shocked the mountaineering world but also medical science as doctors were in awe of what the human body was capable of and how little they knew about it.
Messner is not only one of the best mountaineers of his time but many people argue he is the best ever. A reason many say that is due to what he did in 1980 on Everest. After the iconic Everest climb without supplementary oxygen in 1978, he was back with an even more ambitious plan. He wanted to climb Everest alone without supplementary oxygen in alpine style with zero help. On May 8, 1980, he did it to become the first to climb Everest alone. That climb changed him and it changed how people saw mountaineering, inspiring a generation of climbers.
Japan’s Junko Tabei became the first woman to stand atop Everest in 1975. This was considered an iconic Everest climb back then given how women were treated in society. Despite coming from a progressive nation like Japan, Tabei still had to face social stigma and taboos to get to the top of Everest. She was only 4’9’’, but she was considered a giant and paved the way for women in the sport of mountaineering not only in Japan but the world. That paved the way for women like Wanda Rutkiewicz among others. Another notable woman to have climbed Everest is Lydia Bradey who did so without the use of supplementary oxygen. This showed many in the world that women also belonged in a sport that was dominated by men.
Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld’s ascent of Everest in 1963 is regarded as one of the toughest yet iconic Everest climbs. Representing a United States team, the two did the unthinkable and climbed the mountain via the challenging West Ridge. The route is rarely repeated as it is narrow steep and extremely difficult. The testament to that is that the last summit on this route came in 1991 as only nine people have reached the summit since 1963.
The southwest face is one of the toughest routes on Everest. After five previous attempts at the route, a British team in the autumn of 1975 achieved an iconic Everest climb via this tough route. At the time, this ascent was groundbreaking in many ways as it needed great individual contribution along with an overall team effort. The large team was led by Chris Bonington, and Dougal Haston and Doug Scott reached the summit via the route first. The key to this expedition was learnings from past attempts on the mountain and the use of rock climbing techniques to put fixed ropes up the face from the Western Cwm to just below the South Summit. Many people say this, at the time, was one of the hardest extreme altitude technical climbing ever undertaken, hence one of the historically iconic Everest climbs.
Winter ascents of mountains are rare. Due to unpredictable weather conditions and freezing temperatures, people refrain from climbing it. What makes climbing even more difficult during the winter is there is hardly anyone there leaving mavericks like Jost Kobuch trying to climb the mountain alone.
But in 1980, the Polish duo of  Krzystof Wielicki and Leszek Cichy, with their iconic Everest climb, defied the weather and critics to stand on the summit of Everest in the winter. Many people felt they would fail, but thanks to a strong team and sheer will, they reached the summit of Everest and returned to tell the tale. This first winter ascent of an 8000m mountain gave people the belief that these high mountain peaks could be climbed in winter too as attempts started to be made regularly on other peaks.
The Kangshung Face (East Face) is considered one of the toughest and most technically challenging routes on Everest due to a number of factors. Located in Tibet, this route is steep and requires advanced technical skills, which is why the first ascent of the mountain in 1983 by an American expedition is considered an iconic Everest climb.
Led by James D Morrissey, Kim Momb, Carlos Buhler, Louis Reichardt, George Lowe, Dan Reid and Jay Cassell reached the summit of the mountain via the Kangshung Face. These climbers navigated complex terrain and avalanche-prone areas in a part of the mountain that is exposed to high winds and frequent storms. Rarely do people attempt this route which shows how tough it is to climb Everest via this route and how important and iconic Everest climb this ascent was.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/most-iconic-everest-climbs-1953-2023.html,travel

Whether you seek tranquillity, spiritual solace, or simply wish to immerse yourself in the captivating surroundings, ponds in Lalitpur are sure to leave an indelible impression.
Here are a few ponds to visit next time you are in the city.
Nagdaha, also known as Nagpokhari, is a famous religious pilgrimage site located in Subba village, Dhapakhel, in Lalitpur. Situated about five kilometres away from Lagankhel, this sacred site is considered the abode of Nagraj Vasuki, the serpent king. This is also one of the ponds in Lalitpur that is believed to have formed during the formation of the Kathmandu valley.
Nhupukhu or Naupokhari is one of the historic ponds in Lalitpur located in Lagankhel, southeast of Patan Hospital. This pond was recently revived with local efforts, bringing new life into this ancient pond, which dates back to the Malla era. The pond holds cultural and environmental importance. It is a popular destination for birdwatching enthusiasts who visit to observe the diverse avian population.
Bojepokhari, located in Imadol, Lalitpur, is a pond believed to predate the civilisation in the Kathmandu valley. The locals believe that Bojepokhari or Ibidaha is one of the earliest natural ponds in Lalitpur formed with the creation of the valley. Originally known as Ibidaha, the pond played a significant role in giving Imadol its name. Despite its historical significance, Bojepokhari has only recently started to gain attention from people who visit the area to appreciate its natural heritage. However, there is still much to be uncovered and appreciated about this pond.
Nagbahal Pokhari is among those ponds in Lalitpur that are located in a more residential neighbourhood in Lalitpur. It is a rather smaller pond in comparison but is a peaceful retreat within the bustling city, offering residents and visitors a place to unwind and enjoy nature. The area is also popular for other social and religious events like Samyak Mahadaan.
Situated inside the premises of the Patan Durbar Square, Bhandarkhal Pokhari is among the significant ponds in Lalitpur. It is a pond with historical importance surrounded by ancient architecture, which adds to the beauty of the landmark. It even serves as a charming backdrop for the famous Durbar Square area. The pond’s presence adds to the cultural and architectural heritage of Patan, attracting both tourists and locals alike.
Deypukhu is among the notable ponds in Lalitpur located in the Bungamati area. The pond reflects the local lifestyle and culture and also holds a close relationship with the culture and traditions of the Rato Machhindranath temple. It serves as a focal point for community gatherings and cultural events, adding vibrancy and charm to the village atmosphere. The pond is decorated with images of different deities to add to the ambience.
Pimbahal Pokhari is a small yet picturesque pond nestled in the neighbourhood of Pimbahal, Lalitpur.

Nepal Airlines preparing for Kathmandu-Sydney flights via Singapore,"Thursday, May 25, 2023","Kathmandu, May 25
Nepal’s national flag carrier Nepal Airlines Corporation is preparing to start Kathmandu-Sydney flights via Singapore soon.
The corporation’s assistant spokesperson Ganesh Kumar Ghimire says the corporation recently received slots for taking off and landing at Sydney Airport from Australian authorities. But a few other procedures have yet to be completed for starting the flights, according to him.
The corporation has proposed June 21 as the date to begin Kathmandu-Sydney flights, but Australia has not approved that yet.
The flights will stop in Singapore briefly, only for refilling fuel.
Nepal and Australia signed an aviation agreement four years ago, but no efforts have been made for commercial flights. During the Covid pandemic, a few chartered flights connected Nepal with Australia, one of the biggest hosts for Nepali students abroad.

"Ponds in Bhaktapur: Your next rest stop, a breath of fresh air","Thursday, May 25, 2023","Bhaktapur boasts numerous ancient and traditional ponds, each with its unique history and significance. Some of these most well-known ponds in Bhaktapur were established centuries ago and were once central to the environmental and social life of the people.
With time, many of these ponds were encroached upon or dried up. But in recent years, the city has revived many of these ponds, attracting many local and international tourists alike. Some of these have become important cultural and social landmarks.
Here are a few ponds in Bhaktapur that are worth a visit next time you are in the city.
Among all the ponds in Bhaktapur, Siddhapokhari is a historic pond with rich cultural significance. Arguably one of the largest human-made ponds and most famous landmarks in the city, it was constructed during the reign of King Yaksha Malla in the 15th century. It is believed to have been used for various religious and ceremonial purposes. Siddhapokhari is known for its intricate stone carvings and traditional architecture surrounding the pond. Among all the landmarks and ponds in Bhaktapur, It attracts tourists and locals alike who visit to appreciate its beauty and historical importance.
Kamalpokhari, meaning the lotus pond, is a well-known artificial pond situated in the heart of Bhaktapur, near the Kamal Binayak temple. It is one among the many ponds in Bhaktapur with a long history dating back to the 16th century when it was built during the reign of King Kamal Narsingh Malla and has cultural importance. It is popular for its serene atmosphere and the beautiful lotus flowers that bloom in abundance during the summer months. It has become a popular spot for locals and tourists alike to relax and unwind amidst the bustling city.
Siddhapokhari is famous in the area, but, an alley away, opposite this very pond is another pond, Bhajya or Bhajupokhari. This is a historic pond that holds cultural and religious significance built by Jitamitra Malla in the 12th century, 500 years before Ranipokhari of Kathmandu was built. There is a temple in the middle of Bhajyapokhari built in the Shikhara style. Though the pond is under construction as of now, it is still a landmark famous among the locals and known for its beauty and rich cultural heritage of Bhaktapur.
Nagpokhari, also known as the snake pond, is a fascinating water body located near Dattatreya Square in Bhaktapur. As its name suggests, Nagpokhari is associated with local legends and folklore about snakes–including a mythical serpent–that were once said to have resided in the pond. The natural spring was built in the 17th century by Jitamitra Malla as a royal bath for the then-royal family. Among the many ponds in Bhaktapur, this pond also has a serene and picturesque spot, surrounded by old temples and traditional Newa architecture. Nagpokhari is not only a place of natural beauty but also a cultural landmark that offers visitors a glimpse into the spiritual beliefs and traditions of the local community.
Just some steps away from Siddhapokhari is another pond, Napukhu or Guhyepokhari. It is considered one of the important ponds in Bhaktapur with stories of its origin in the epic Mahabharat. Napukhu is said to be dug by the Pandava brothers overnight and they ate their meals nearby the pond. This pond is surrounded by ancient temples made of ancient Newa architecture, creating a serene and sacred ambience that draws both locals and tourists seeking solace and spiritual reflection. The pond was also reconstructed a few years ago to get the outlook that it has today.
This pond is situated near Bhaktapur’s famous Kwathandau Tole. It is small yet among the many water bodies that contribute to the city’s charm. The pond is surrounded by ancient brick structures providing a glimpse into Bhaktapur’s architectural heritage. Kwathandau Pond is a place where locals often gather to relax, chat and enjoy the peaceful ambience. Like other ponds in Bhaktapur, visitors can also sit on the premises and soak in the tranquillity or explore the nearby streets to experience the vibrant culture and heritage of Bhaktapur.
Ranipokhari or the queen’s pond is one of the most prominent ponds in Bhaktapur. This pond is said to have been built some 40 years ago than the Ranipokhari in Kathmandu. This water body was built by King Jagat Jyoti Malla of Bhaktapur for his Queen Rajlaxmi. Ranipokhari is surrounded by intricately carved stone sculptures, creating a visual spectacle that reflects the city’s rich artistic heritage. It was recently reconstructed and made open to the public. Almost next to Siddhapokhari, this pond is getting popular as a new favourite destination for locals and tourists to relax, enjoy the scenic beauty, and appreciate the rich history of the area.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ponds-in-bhaktapur-landmarks-of-nepal.html,travel

"Kami Rita Sherpa climbs Everest 28th time, leaving Pasang Dawa Sherpa behind the record","Tuesday, May 23, 2023","Kathmandu, May 23
Kami Rita Sherpa has once again created history and made it 28 ascents of Everest, the highest number of summits of the highest peak.
This is his second mountain ascent this season after leading clients to the top on May 17. This is his 40th ascent of an 8000-metre mountain which is also a record.
Kami Rita, from Thame in Khumbu, first summited the mountain in 1994.

What are major mountaineering records held by Nepalis?,"Monday, May 22, 2023","Even though Nepal is home to several 8000-metre mountains, most of the mountaineering records are owned by foreigners. But in recent times, Nepalis are creating records that will not be easily broken.
The recent record created by Nepali-British Hari Budha Magar, in fact, follows a long list of mountaineering records held by Nepalis.
Nirmal Purja Magar (Nimsdai) in 2019 took on a monumental challenge and climbed all 14 8000-metre peaks in six months and six days. A team of mountaineers even climbed K2 in the winter and sang the Nepali national anthem on the top. Similarly, Kami Rita Sherpa continues to climb Everest making it 27 ascents of the mountain.
Nepalis, slowly and steadily, are reclaiming and making mountaineering records on 8000-metre mountains. Here are a few biggest and most interesting of them.
Kami Rita Sherpa is a legend in the field of mountaineering. He currently holds two mountaineering records as he climbed Everest for a record 28 times, the most ever by any. Likewise, he has also made 40 ascents of an 8000-metre mountain, again the most by any. There are a few Nepalis behind him, but it is safe to say, this record will stay for a long time.
In a sport dominated by Nepali, Lhakpa Sherpa has done something quite remarkable as she has broken social taboos to climb Everest a record 10 times, the most by any woman. Lhakpa, a single mother, lives in the US and often flies halfway across the world to climb the highest mountain in the world. This year, however, she did not climb Everest and is preparing to climb K2.
Mingma David Sherpa holds different mountaineering records, but one that he is really proud of is being the man with the most number of ascents of the savage mountain K2. As of May 2023, Mingma David Sherpa has five ascents of the mountain including a winter ascent of the mountain.
Mingma David Sherpa is back on the list as he currently holds the record for being the youngest to climb all 14 eight thousand-metre peaks in the world. Amid several young climbers chasing several mountaineering records, the record might not hold up for long, but at 30 years and 166 days, Mingma David in October 2019 created history. It took him nine years and 159 days to achieve this feat.
In 2019, Nirmal Purja Magar (Nimsdai) did something unthinkable. With the help of some of the strongest climbers in Nepal, Magar climbed all 14 eight thousand-metre peaks in six months. He not only broke the previous record but obliterated it. Currently, Norwegian climber Kristin Harila is trying to break this record held by Nimsdai.
Out of all the 8000-metre mountains in the world, K2 was the only one that had not been climbed in winter and hence with fewer mountaineering records. In 2021, that changed after a team of 10 Nepali climbers led by Mingma G and Nimsdai reached the summit. The team was hungry to do it as this was the last prize remaining in mountaineering and said they did it not for themselves, but for all of Nepal.
Sanu Sherpa in July 2022 did something no one had as he climbed all 14 eight thousand metre mountains twice. He achieved this feat in a little over 15 years.
Ang Rita Sherpa was one of the best climbers out there. At a time when no-O2 summits were rare, Ang Rita made 10 ascents of Everest without supplementary oxygen which is still one of the most unthinkable mountaineering records. His ability to perform in the death zone without oxygen gave him the title of the snow leopard. His climbing career also includes nine successful ascents of three other 8,000-ers which were achieved without the use of supplementary oxygen.
Hari Budha Magar had done the unthinkable as what the government of Nepal had thought it would never see as he reached the top of Everest with the help of his prosthetic legs. With the summit, he became the first above-the-knee double amputee to reach the summit of the mountain.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/major-mountaineering-records-nepalis.html,travel
Hari Budha Magar becomes the first above-the-knee double amputee to climb Everest,"Saturday, May 20, 2023","Kathmandu, May 20
Hari Budha Magar has created history as he becomes the first above-the-knee double amputee to climb Everest.
He reached the summit of the mountain on Friday afternoon with high-altitude mountain guide Krishna Thapa, said sources from the base camp. He is descending from the mountain, they said.
Hari Budha climbed Everest to inspire differently-abled people from all across the globe and prove a point that if given the right opportunity, even they could break the stigma and do wonders.
“That was tough. Harder than I could have ever imagined. We just had to carry on and push for the top, no matter how much it hurt or how long it took. If I can climb to the top of the world then anyone, regardless of their disability, can achieve their dream,” said Hari Budha in a statement issued by his team.
The journey to the summit has not been an easy one for Hari Budha as he had to fight a long legal battle after Nepal’s government, in 2017, banned amputees from climbing Everest. The Supreme Court, however, reversed the government’s decision to the delight of many amputee adventurers.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-budha-magar-everest-history.html,travel
Everest 2023: 8 deaths reported so far,"Friday, May 19, 2023","Kathmandu, May 19
The death toll in Everest in 2023 has reached eight.
According to sources at the base camp, two climbers died on Thursday. China’s Xuebin Chen died high up on the mountain while India’s Suzanne Leopoldina Jesus died in Lukla during treatment.
Reports coming out of the mountain are of Chen falling to his death near the South Summit. Jesus, on the other hand, was suffering from illness and had refused to leave base camp before she was taken to Lukla for treatment.
On May 1, American doctor Jonathon Sugarman died at camp 2 on Everest while Phurba Sherpa, a member of Nepal Army’s clean-up campaign died near camp 4 on May 16. Moldovan climber Victor Brinza died at the South Col on May 17. All these deaths were due to high altitude sickness, said sources from base camp.

9 hidden gems in Nepal for off-the-beaten-path travellers,"Monday, May 8, 2023","Nepal being a trekkers’ paradise is an open secret. The country sees nearly 100,000 trekkers walking on trains like Everest base camp, Annapurna base camp, Langtang and Annapurna circuit every year. But apart from these commercial routes, the are many hidden gems in Nepal that will leave you wanting more.
These hidden gems stretch out from Kanchenjunga base camp in the east to Limi valley in the far west. These trails are untouched and are rarely trekked by many foreigners. It is remote and untouched by modern amenities as you go back in time living with basics.
In most of these hidden gems in Nepal, you will have to take maps, tents and cooking utensils and preferably a guide (or a porter) too as these off-beaten paths might be tricky and chances of getting lost are quite high.
Nepal has multiple Panch Pokharis, which translates to five ponds. But Panch Pokhari in the Sindhupalchok district, east of Kathmandu, may be the prettiest one and one of the least explored hidden gems in Nepal. The trek is short and sweet, yet it takes you above the hills you see east of Kathmandu. The trek is quite raw and does not have many tea houses along the way and even the ones you find do not have single rooms as you will have to sleep in a dorm that usually caters to pilgrims that go there during Janaipurnima, a famous Hindu festival.
The view from Panch Pokahri is quite majestic. The Jugal Himal is right in your face, but what stands out the most is the sunrise seen from the top of the Panch Pokhari along with the evening sunset. The best time to get there is November.
The guerrilla trek trail is one of the newly-discovered hidden gems in Nepal. This trekking route follows the path used by Maoist rebels during the armed conflict. The trail starts from Beni near Pokhara and ends in Jelbang in Rolpa.
The trek is not difficult but given its remoteness, it is tricky as you walk through places that you might get lost in. But that said, the trek takes you through remote villages, beautiful forests and stunning landscapes and you get to see sights the Maoist guerillas saw including their training camps.
As the trail is also relatively new, facilities like accommodation and food are not well developed in some places but if you like walking through the hidden gems in Nepal such as the trails not many have walked, this should be on your bucket list.
One of the hidden gems in Nepal, the Tamang heritage trail in Nepal is a popular beginner’s trek, yet not many people venture out into these villages in northern Rasuwa. The trek, as the name suggests, takes you to remote Tamang villages and offers a unique opportunity to experience the local culture and lifestyle of the Tamang people, who are known for their hospitality, rich cultural heritage, and traditional practices.
Along the way, you will visit several traditional Tamang villages, including Gatlang, Tatopani, Thuman, and Briddim, where you can experience their unique culture and lifestyle.
The Tamang heritage trail is best suited for those who want to see more than just mountains. This trek gives people a chance to experience people and their behaviour in the remote part of Nepal.
This is one the most remote and challenging treks in Nepal, hence of the greatest hidden gems in Nepal, that takes you to the remotest parts of western Nepal. Apart from the glorious views of mountains, hills and lakes, the trek also gives people a great opportunity to experience the local culture and lifestyle of people living there. The area is untouched but modern amenities make the experience of trekking there even more special as it takes you to traditional Dolpo villages, including Shey Gompa, which is home to a famous Tibetan monastery and a sacred crystal mountain.
That said, it takes nearly a month to trek this trail requires crossing high mountain passes, including Kang La Pass (5,360m) and Saldang La Pass (5,200m). Only opt for this if you are fit and have experience trekking in the wilderness before.
This trek is probably the most remote and off-the-beaten-path trek on this list of hidden gems in Nepal. Not many people trek to the Limi valley, which is in the northwestern part of Nepal. The place is so remote many people fly there to catch glimpses of Mount Kailash where Hindus believe Lord Shiva lives.
The trek to Limi valley begins from Simikot and takes you through beautiful landscapes, including high mountain passes and deep valleys. You also walk past several ancient monasteries, including the Halji and Jhang monasteries, which are some of the oldest and most important monasteries in the region.
It takes around 20 days to complete this trek and you will have to camp almost the entire trek as there are no tea houses along the trail. The trek is challenging, but the rewards are well worth the effort of exploring hidden gems in Nepal.
The Saipal base camp trek in Nepal is another remote and off-the-beaten-path trek that takes you through various hidden gems in Nepal around the beautiful Saipal Himal range in the far-western region.
Like the treks above, this too offers trekkers a chance to experience the natural beauty of the region while exploring traditional villages and enjoying stunning views of the snow-capped peaks along the way.
The trek begins at Chainpur and takes you through beautiful landscapes, including high mountain passes and stunning lakes. The trek takes you through places like Bajhang, Dandakot, and Saipal, which are known for their unique culture and lifestyle.
The trek takes nearly three weeks and makes you walk past Saipal La at 4,200 metres. This trek also requires people to camp most of the way as there are no tea houses.
Close to Saipal is Api Himal, which is again one of the remotest hidden gems in Nepal. The trek takes you to the base of Api Himal, the highest mountain in far-western Nepal.
The trek begins from the town of Gokuleshwor and takes you through beautiful landscapes and past high mountain passes. The trek takes you through several traditional villages, including Choyo, Dharapani, and Ghusa, which are known for their unique culture and lifestyle.
With no tea houses, you have to camp along the trail and maybe that is what makes the trek stand out among other hidden gems in Nepal.
This off-the-beaten-path trek takes you to the beautiful Badimalika region in far-western Nepal. The natural beauty of the place is unique as is its unique culture and lifestyle. The region is named after the Badimalika temple, which is a sacred Hindu pilgrimage site at an altitude of 4,400 metres.
The Badimalika region, as one of the hidden gems in Nepal, is also untouched by modernisation and offers a unique opportunity for trekkers to experience the remote and unspoiled beauty of the Himalayas.
The region is also known for its wildlife, including snow leopards, Himalayan black bears, and musk deer, and is home to several rare and endangered plant species. Lush green post-monsoon, the colour of the region changes significantly during autumn and winter. The place is magical and is worth a visit.
Located in the Manaslu region, the Tsum valley trek takes you to an unspoiled and untouched region of Nepal. There is a certain mysticism to this trek as the culture and traditions found here are truly unique.
The people living there are of Tibetan origin and are primarily Buddhists. That is why the region has several ancient monasteries and gompas, including the Rachen Gompa and Mu Gompa, which are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists.
The trek takes you through beautiful landscapes, including lush forests, alpine meadows, and high mountain passes, offering stunning views of the surrounding snow-capped peaks. The trek also takes you through several traditional villages, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.
Trekking to the Tsum valley takes you close to the Ganesh Himal too and if you climb high, you can also see the Tibetan plateaus to the north. The trek also takes you through traditional villages like Chumling, Chhokangparo, and Nile, where you can experience the traditional culture of people living around hidden gems in Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hidden-gems-in-nepal-for-trekkers.html,travel
The fierce Pasang Lhamu Sherpa relives in a documentary 30 years after her brave death,"Sunday, May 7, 2023","Pasang Lhamu Sherpa was a fierce woman. At a time when women had to live up to certain standards of society, she just did not care what others thought of her.
She hated it when someone told her she could not do something. Her mother told her she could not attend school like her brothers did. Her father told her she could not come on expeditions with him. This infuriated Pasang Lhamu, and rightly so.
She wanted to break the shackles and ensure women from the Sherpa community and the country could dream big and by standing on the summit of Everest on April 22, 1993, she did exactly that.
At a time when women were asked to stay home and look after their families, Pasang Lhamu Sherpa chose the extreme and decided to follow her dream. This came at a cost as she died during her descent, but her journey did not go in vain as she was able to inspire thousands of Nepali women.
A recently screened documentary on her titled Pasang: In the Shadow of Everest tells exactly that. It tells the story of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa and her sheer will, courage, obsession, and why she wanted to climb Everest.
The documentary takes us into the life of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa and shows us how hard it was for her, a woman, to go out and do something in a sport dominated by men.
She felt that first-hand as the documentary shows how French alpinist Marc Batard in 1990 told her to head back down from the mountain as the expedition leader did not think she could reach the summit.
It tells us how she was told by everyone that she should stay home and look after her children and not venture out into the mountains where she could lose her life.
But Pasang Lhamu Sherpa did not listen to anyone as she persevered towards her goal – to become the first Nepali woman to climb Everest. Her bivouacking in the south summit in 1991 is proof of that as she proved how mentally strong she was.
“Women from across the world have done wonders because they got the opportunities that we living in Nepal haven’t. I want to prove that we too can do the unthinkable,” she is heard saying in the film.
And she is right. Before her, 16 women from all over the world had climbed Everest. While they climbed, no one from Nepal even dreamt of climbing it.
The documentary on Pasang Lhamu Sherpa took nearly a decade to be made and relied on archived footage shot by news agencies in Nepal and foreigners. But the story it has told is simple yet powerful.
The director, Nancy Svendsen, even tracked down Pemba Norbu who is the last person to see Pasang Lhamu alive.
The film also shows how hard it was for her to fund the expedition on her own as Pasang Lhamu and her husband Sonam sold 60 per cent of their company to fund it.
She tried to seek help from the government and even spoke to the prime minister, but even that was in vain as she had to pay permit fees to climb the mountain.
The film shows how her eldest daughter, Dawa Futi Sherpa, is going back to find her mother and is trying to tell Pasang Lhamu Sherpa’s story to the world.
It also shows how much her husband Sonam Sherpa, who she eloped with, supported her on her quest. In all four of her attempts, Soman was on Everest rallying her and ensuring things were in place for his wife to create history.
On her trips to Europe with Sonam, Pasang Lhamu Sherpa saw how women ventured out into adventure activities, after which she climbed Mont Blanc. A wife of a Nepali climber accompanying him on his adventures in Europe is quite rare even today so Pasang Lhamu doing this in the 80s when the society was as conservative as ever, is something quite rare.
Yet, there she was at Chamonix dreaming of climbing Mount Everest and becoming the first woman to do so.
Svendsen travelled to Nepal and France to make this film and worked on it extensively with Pasang Lhamu Sherpa’s daughter Dawa Futi. She has done a tremendous job to show Pasang Lhamu’s courage and tenacity and how she dealt with problems at every turn in her life including from the society that questioned why a mother of three was risking her life to climb Everest.
“Dawa learned so much about her mother and saw so many pictures and movies that she had never seen before because the family didn’t have them. This has been a process of healing for them,” Svendsen told the Golden Globe Awards in March 2022.
Since it was released in 2022, the film has been officially selected for 20 film festivals and has won awards in 11 of them including Telluride in Colorado, Kendall Mountain in the UK and the BANFF in Canada.
The accolades might keep on coming for this film that tells the story of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa and her heroism that in a country like Nepal is rarely recognised. She inspired a generation of Nepali women who went out and did what they wanted to do in life. Nepali women like Lhakpa Sherpa, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, Pasang Lhamu Akita and 62 others have climbed Everest following Pasang Lhamu Sherpa.

Nepal issues highest number of Everest climbing permits in history this spring season,"Tuesday, May 2, 2023","Kathmandu, May 2
A record number of climbers are attempting to scale the highest mountain in the world this spring as Nepal issues the highest number of Everest climbing permits in history for the season.
According to the Department of Tourism, 466 climbers from 43 groups have obtained permit. Among them 98 are female and the remaining 368 are male, says the department.
Climbers eyeing to scale Everest (Sagarmatha) this season are from 65 countries including Nepal, as per the statistics of the department. From Nepal, 15 climbers have received the permit.
Similarly, 96 climbers from China have got the permit followed by 89 from the USA and 40 from India. Likewise, 33 from Hungary have acquired the permit, 21 from Canada, 18 from Russia and 15 from the UK among others.
Former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, Ang Tshering Sherpa, opines that the number of climbers obtaining Everest climbing permits from Nepal might have increased considerably as climbing from the Tibet side (northeast ridge route) is not permitted since the Covid pandemic.
It has been 70 years since humans first set their feet at the top of Mt Everest. Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary successfully reached Everest’s top on May 29, 1953. Since then, around 7,000 national and international climbers have successfully climbed the 8,848.86-metre mountain while over 300 have lost their lives attempting it to date, according to the department.
In 2022, 323 climbers from 44 groups had obtained Everest climbing permits, informs Bigyan Koirala at the Mountaineering Section of the department.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/record-everest-climbing-permits-2023.html,travel
Ama Yangri trek: It’s as much about the journey as the destination,"Tuesday, May 2, 2023","I had been planning to go on a trek for a long, long time. But for one reason or another, I had never been able to do so. Every time when I planned one, someone from my friends’ circle would cancel it. There were times when I had to cancel it myself too. But on Nepali New Year’s Day last month, it was as if the whole universe conspired to make our plan a success.
On that auspicious day, I and a few of my dear friends stood atop Ama Yangri, a hilltop in Sindhupalchok, and we witnessed the breathtaking views of sparkling mountains—Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse and Makalu— which were all there right in front of our eyes, standing tall in their snow-capped glory.
What was supposed to be just a short escape from the humdrum of city life turned out to be a lesson in the power of nature and even an opportunity to reflect on my privilege as a city dweller.
Though it was mid-April, mornings in Kathmandu were still chilly. I woke up at 4 am and got ready quickly. Then, I met Bharat, a friend who lives nearby, at around 5 am. We took a taxi from Thimi Chok to Narayantar, Kathmandu and picked up Jesson, Abhishek kaka and Smarika on our way. We then met Binita and Anjali who got out of another cab.
The taxi ride was quite fun. We played some bhajans in the cab; we wanted nothing but good vibes on this trip.
We reached Narayantar Buspark at 5:45 am. We had booked six seats, but there were seven of us. The bus driver told us there was no extra seat and that left us in a real pickle. There was still a vacant seat on the bus though as the person who had booked it had yet to arrive. Bharat took it.
Our bus left at exactly 6 am. Only one bus leaves every day for Tarke Ghyang in Sindhupalchok from Kathmandu. One has to make sure to purchase the ticket a day or two before; not everyone can be lucky as we were that day. (The bus ticket from Kathmandu to Tarke Ghyang costs Rs 600.)
The road up to Sankhu is more or less smooth. Beyond that, it is rough, dusty and bumpy; travelling through it can be an adventure in itself. As you get to Melamchi, you can see a number of empty houses that collapsed in the floods of June 2021. Our bus had to cross a couple of risky bridges that did not have any railings.
By 10 am, we had reached Timbu, where we had our lunch—a plate of dal-bhat-tarkari that cost Rs 170.
By 12:15 pm, we had reached Tarke Ghyang, the bus’s last stop. As soon as we got off, we got confused about how to move forward. We did not know if it was a good idea to stay at Tarke Ghyang or to walk towards Ama Yangri base camp.
It was only mid-day and staying at Tarke Gyang seemed a lazy thing to do. So we headed off towards the base camp for what turned out to be a four-hour hike.

On the trail, we met some locals. They were very cheerful and wished us Tashi Delek, a Tibetan expression used to greet people. They even posed for our cameras and wished us a good journey ahead.
The trail also has a lot of flat areas where you can rest. We sat down on one of those spots and played the ukulele and harmonica that we had taken with us and started singing classics like Aankha Ko Need, Maya Maryou Timile, Timro Aankha Herdai and In Dino.
We reached Ama Yangri base camp at 5 pm. The place was chilly as a cool wind was blowing. We realised we had climbed up a bit.
The base camp is accessible through off-road tracks, so if you have bikes, you can easily get here. But, as the track is quite poor, I would personally not prefer to get there on a bike.
By the time we got there, we were hungry and as it was cold, we ordered a noodle soup. I do not know if it was hunger or the person’s cooking prowess, but the noodle soup was the best I had ever had in my life.
We had our dinner after a while. The dinner itself was quite average, but the highlight was the pickle we made ourselves in the kitchen at Ama Yangri base camp.
Ama Yangri does not have great accommodations. We were told that we had to sleep in a tent. All seven of us fitted in the tent quite easily and our tired bodies slept well. The place was reasonable as they charged us Rs 1,000 per person. This also includes our meals.
We were all set to reach the top of Ama Yangri. As I was having morning tea, coincidentally I saw Pooja, a friend of mine. She was with her two friends: Dridhata and Aayush. Three of them joined us and now our team of seven became 10.
As we were planning our journey, we saw the sun rise over the mountains at 6 am. We wanted to watch it from the top of Ama Yangri at an altitude of 3,770m. But we were too lazy to get up and by the time we did, we were too late. But that said, the view from the base camp was still quite majestic.
After watching the sunrise, we set off towards Ama Yangri. The trail from base camp to Ama Yangri was very tough as it was entirely uphill.
Tired of constantly walking uphill, some of us wanted to quit. But all of us persevered and after taking frequent breaks, ingesting energy drinks and chocolates, all of us pulled through and made it to the top. Motivating each other is key to overcoming negativity while walking uphill.
The top of Ama Yangri was amazing as it welcomed us with a beautiful mountain view. Once we were at the top, we forgot how tired we were.
A puja ceremony was taking place there, so we got the chance to have free food. We stayed there for around four hours and got down to the base camp.
Since we had enough time, we decided to leave the base camp and head towards Tarke Ghyang, from where the bus would leave for Kathmandu.
Getting back to Tarke Ghyang was easy. We just had to walk flat and downhill trails, which was such a respite after the uphill climb to Ama Yangri. None of us got tired. We even danced and played music along the way and at around 6 pm, we reached Hotel Tarke Ghyang. The hotel was very reasonable as it cost Rs 200 for a vegetarian meal and Rs 1,000 for a room that had a capacity of seven people.
It is tricky to get a bus to return to Kathmandu from Tarke Ghyang as you have to get a ticket on a first come first basis, there is not any system for booking. The only way you get a seat is to wake up early, go right away and claim a seat on the bus. If you do not do this, you will have to stand on the bus for the entire journey to Kathmandu. Fearing that situation, all of us got up early and managed to get seats.
Ama Yangri makes for a memorable trek. This experience made me realise the power of nature. How even a brief engagement with nature and its beauty would help you sideline your problems and live freely. Another lesson was anthropological, how, despite many hardships brought on by inadequate transportation infrastructure, a lack of healthcare and educational opportunities, and other factors, people there still managed to live happily and successfully.
This made me reflect on my privilege as a city dweller. But somehow, I was also envious, wondering what it would be like to live a seemingly happy, smooth life as those villagers did.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ama-yangri-treksindhupalchok-nepal.html,travel
"2 Nepali climbers barred from the 14-peak record, point the finger at white competitor and agent","Monday, May 1, 2023","Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa are upset. The two mountaineers had planned everything to go to China to climb Cho Oyu and Shishapangma to finish climbing all the 14 8,000-metre mountains. They were so close to their dream.
On April 4, the two received their visas to go to China and were ecstatic as they were finally going to complete their long-awaited dream. But their joy was short-lived as on April 6 as their agent told them their visas were cancelled by the embassy.
“They told us we could not go to China as we had recently been to Pakistan. During the interview, we clearly told the embassy we had been to Pakistan and they had no problem, but two days after getting our visas, our agent told us we could not go. It makes no sense,” says Dawa Ongju Sherpa.
Their agent, Climbalaya Treks & Expeditions, recently ran an expedition in Shishapangma during which a host of climbers reached the summit. Everyone that applied for visas through Climbalaya got their applications approved apart from two – Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa. Record-chasing Norwegian climber Kristin Harila also received her visa as she reached the summit of Shishapangma and is now one mountain away from climbing all 14 8000-ers.
But why? An investigation reveals Harila and Climbalaya might have played a role to make sure the two did not get visas to go to China.
Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa claim this was a ploy not to let them climb as they too were going for the same record Harila was.
“This is what money can do. People are bringing politics into mountaineering and it is disgusting,” says Dawa Ongju, suspecting Climbalaya was bribed to bar them from getting their visa.
The Chinese Embassy in Nepal says their visas were cancelled as the two had withdrawn their applications before a decision. But Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa say they have not done so and say everything was dealt with by Climbalaya.
“China and Nepal are friendly neighbouring countries, we welcome all Nepali friends to visit China,” said an official from the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu.
“This is a disgusting act by the agent. We do not know if they took the money but this is politics of the highest level as they have stopped two of their own from getting this record,” Dawa Ongju says.
Harila denies playing a role in anything of this on a social media post while Climbalaya says the visa was cancelled by the embassy and not them.
“We don’t know why the embassy is saying that, but the embassy cancelled their (Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa) visa we did not withdraw it,” says Dawa Sherpa from Climbalaya.
8K Expeditions, the company the two work with, says they were sending the two of their best guides to China despite needing them to guide people on Everest.
“I understood why they wanted to go and I was looking forward to them climbing the two remaining mountains there. But, now, with details coming out, it is clear they were robbed of this opportunity,” says Lhakpa Sherpa, the founder of 8K Expeditions.
Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa’s passports were held by the agent until the day everyone left for China. The two had even asked for their passports but were told the papers were held by the embassy.
“When I told them I would go to the embassy, they asked me to come to their office and collect it. That is when I found out that they were trying to con us,” says Dawa Ongju who argues why would the two who were chasing 8,000-metre summits withdraw their applications.
Over the past year, Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa have been through a lot. The two guided Harila to the summit of 12 of the 14 8,000-metre mountains. They did so in record time too as they only took 148 days and were only two mountains away from breaking the speed record held by Nirmal Purja Magar (Nimsdai).
But with China closing its mountains, they were left disappointed as the two, along with Harila, had to give up on their mission.
Following that, Harila jumped ships. While she said she was climbing to prove to the world how capable women were on the mountain, she also stated how she wanted to share the record with her two guides. However, after climbing Manaslu on September 23, 2022, things changed as she started to distance herself from Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa.
“I do not know what changed, but she suddenly cut contact. We had a verbal agreement to do it together but it seems words don’t mean anything anymore,” says Dawa Ongju.
Harila joined another company and tried to climb Cho Oyu from Nepal. But due to poor weather, she was not able to reach the summit both in autumn and winter.
That is why Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa say they feel betrayed as they say she did not communicate with them before going to Cho Oyu.
But Harila says she asked them to come, but the two say that is a lie.
“We treated her like a sister, then she betrayed us,” says Pasdawa.
They say they helped a novice climber become known throughout the world. They agree Harila is a strong woman and say that they believed in her and her mission and worked day and night to achieve it.
“We did not care about us. We did not care about the dangers because we were chasing something historic together. But where did that get us? Nowhere,” says Pasdawa, who first climbed with Harila in 2021 when he guided her to the summit of Everest and Lhotse in 12 hours.
Both Dawa Ongju and Pasdawa Sherpa say their toughest test was K2 in 2022. There were many Nepali teams on the mountain, but with no one able to fix ropes to the summit, the two volunteered as they worked from 6 am to 11 pm to ensure they were able to summit the killer mountain.
“Both of us worked day and night to open routes on most of the mountains. We did it without thinking about our family back home and the dangers of life as we carried on the unthinkable task of carrying 35-40 kg of weight through ravines, crevasses, rock faces and death zones. It sucks that our dreams were left unfulfilled,” says Pasdawa Sherpa.
Dawa Ongju is just heartbroken. As a climber, he too wanted to climb all 14 8,000-ers. But now with politics being played on the highest level, he feels he will never trust anyone involved again.
“Everyone lied to us. Everyone cheated us. This is very unfair,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dawa-ongju-and-pasdawa-sherpa-14-peak.html,travel
Siddhababa tunnel work: Butwal-Palpa road to be shut during nighttime only,"Sunday, April 30, 2023","Butwal, April 30
Officials in the Lumbini province say they are shutting the Butwal-Palpa road section of the Siddhartha Highway for tunnel construction work at the landslide-troubled Siddhababa area during nighttime only.
Whereas the road was being blocked from 11 am to 2 pm and from 10 pm to 4 am every day until now, the road will be closed from 10 pm to 4 am only from now, according to Palpa Chief District Officer Bandhu Prasad Bastola.
Bastola says the decision was made owing to the common people’s request amid the contractors carrying out the work slowly.
China State Construction Engineering Corporation has been assigned to construct the 1,100-metre tunnel at the cost of Rs 7.34 billion.

Jhandidanda: An unexplored yet exquisite escape in Ilam of eastern Nepal,"Thursday, April 27, 2023","Jhandidanda, located in Rong rural municipality-6 of Ilam, is not as famous as other touristy places of Ilam–such as Ilam Bazaar and Kanyam. However, it has the potential to be one of the most attractive tourist destinations.
After the construction of a trail from Hanspokhari to the Karson station of the Mechi Highway, the popularity of Jhandidanda, also known as Ganjleythumka, increased. Now, it is likely to be more popular in the upcoming months.
Jhandidanda is 17 km north of Kakarbhitta in Jhapa and 10 km south of Harkate Bazar on the Mechi Highway. This place has great potential for tourism as it is accessible from both terai and hilly regions.
One can reach here from India too, taking the route of the Mechi river. There is a facility to reach here from both points of Hanspokhari and Beauty Border by vehicle or foot. The cycling track here is attracting young cyclists.
Hills of such height are a rarity in the Chure region. This fact has also increased the importance of the place, where tourists have begun doing campfires and night stay camps of late.
The place is also important, religiously and culturally. The place is believed to be the spot where an ancestor of Kirat Rai, Rinahang worshipped the goddess. Consequently, the Jhandi playground has recently been named the Rinahang Playground.
For the people of Siliguri and Kolkata of India, Jhandidanda, around 600 km away from Kolkata, can be a nearby place for retreat during the hot weather.
From Kolkata, Kakadbhitta can be reached via Berhampur-Malda and Kishanganj. Likewise, one can get here from Bagdogra Airport via Kakadbhitta. It is 43 km far away from Bagdogra.
Alongside sightseeing, the place is also good for picnics. Locals used to visit this place earlier as well for picnics, especially during the spring and autumn seasons. At picnics, they used to perform traditional dance and music.
Visitors in Jhandidanda can be acclimatised with a beautiful view of the sunrise and sunset during the month of September to May.
To reach Jhandidanda, one can walk all day through Google Point, Dewangadhi, Giddebhir, Daile, and Hallane from the Karsong trail of Hanspokhri and stay around Dhaje Bhanjyang. There are homestays around Dhaje Bhanjyang.
On the northern side of Jhandidanda, we can see dozens of mountain ranges including Kanchanjunga and Kumbakarna.
Similarly, many other hills and places of Terai can be clearly observed from here. It is also a potential place for adventure sports. A Dharahara-like structure has attracted more tourists currently in Jhandidanda. The railings on the ladder to reach the tower have made it look additionally beautiful.
The next day in the morning sunrise can be viewed from Jhandidanda. Places like Kanyam, Antu Danda, Sandakpur, Meghma, Thumke, and many others can be seen in this place. These days, the number of both domestic and international tourists has increased in the place.
Paragliding has been successfully tested around the hills of Jhandidanda in 2022. Tourism entrepreneurs aim to attract tourists from Kolkata through paragliding. If their plan is anything to go by, the paragliding will take off in Ilam and land in Jhapa. Therefore, it will connect tourists from both districts.
Likewise, if you want to experience the local culture, staying in homestays opened at Rambhang is the best experience. The locals perform traditional dance and music for the visitors. These homestays have been opened targeting the visitors of Jhandidanda. A vegetarian plate there costs Rs 150. The room charge is Rs 500.
Due to the homestay, the income of locals has increased. The visitors also buy local vegetables in Jhandidanda, which is also benefiting locals. The locals perform traditional dance and music for the visitors as well.

Anurag Maloo rescue from Annapurna crevasse: Here’s how the impossible was made possible,"Monday, April 24, 2023","When Indian mountaineer Anurag Maloo fell into a crevasse during his descent of Annapurna I on April 17, many feared the worse. No one knew how deep the crevasse was or where he was in it. The crevasse was in one of the most dangerous parts of the mountain, prone to avalanches, which is why no one wanted to go in fearing they would be buried in snow.
“We did not know what to do. We could not force people to go in. We felt helpless,” says Cheepal Sherpa, a member of the rescue team, adding they did not have the proper equipment to rescue him on the first day.
But on the fourth day of the accident, Anurag Maloo was found alive, to surprise the family and the press alike. So how was it possible?
When this news was shared with his family, they were in shock. Emotions were running high but they ensured that they gave everything to bring Anurag Maloo back.
“We didn’t know what to do. We used whatever influence we had and sought help from the Indian government and the Nepal government. We wanted everyone to focus on bringing Anurag back. That was our mission,” says Ashish Maloo, Anurag’s brother.
Soon, everyone started to come on board. People in both India and Nepal started to help the family with whatever they could including equipment like thermal scanners, drones and CO2 scanners. The family were adamant that Anurag Maloo was alive and kept putting pressure to bring him back.
Owing to the pressure, a rescue team was formed under the stewardship of Chhang Dawa Sherpa, an experienced climber and a board member of Seven Summit Treks. But the weather did not help the team. Nepali guides were also reluctant to go in. That is when Polish climber Adam Bielecki, who was attempting a new route on the mountain, volunteered. As he went into the crevasse, he was joined by a member of Seven Summit Treks, Tashi Sherpa.
Bielecki did not know if Anurag Maloo was alive. He thought he was going in to retrieve a body, but when he found him, Anurag was alive. Bielecki and Tashi then carefully got him out using a pulley system that Mariusz Hatala had prepared.
It was not easy as they understood an avalanche could come and bury them at any moment. But the two persevered along with Cheepal Sherpa, Lakpa Sherpa, Dawa Nurbu Sherpa and Lakpa Nuru Sherpa who pulled Anurag out along with Bielecki and Tashi, making it one of the best rescues ever done in Nepal.
“This was one in a million rescue,” says Mingma Sherpa, the chairman of Seven Summit Treks. “We have never seen anything like this.”
It was nothing short of a miracle. But Anurag Maloo, who had spent nearly four days in the crevasse, needed immediate medical care. He was alive, but barely. As soon as he was taken out, he was airlifted to Pokhara’s Manipal Teaching Hospital.
“Doctors there were so helpful. Dr Ashim Subedi gave him CPR for three hours, which made a lot of difference,” says Ashish Maloo.
The Nepali climbers who were part of the rescue are amazed at the way the Indian climber survived.
“He had frostbites everywhere. It is amazing to see him fight for his life and his willpower. I don’t have words to describe it,” says Dawa Nurbu Sherpa.
A post shared by Adam Bielecki (@adamtheclimber)
Anurag Maloo was climbing Annapurna, the 10th-highest mountain in the world, without supplementary oxygen. He tried to push as hard as he could but had to return without summiting the mountain. On his descent to camp 2 on the mountain, he used a short rope resulting in him hitting hard ice and falling into the crevasse.
“I yelled at him to stop, but he could not hear me. It was a shocking moment watching him fall into the crevasse,” says Moeses Fiamoncini, who saw it happen.
Fiamoncini and his guide tried to look for him but with a lack of equipment and no signs of where he fell, they had to return.
Everyone concerned was certain that he was dead. No one had survived such a fall and spent over three days in a crevasse and come out alive. Irish adventurer Noel Hanna dying on Annapurna made things even worse along with Indian climber Baljeet Kaur disappearing.
“Everything was grim. But the family kept pushing us to carry on with our efforts and keep the faith. Looking back, this rescue has given all a belief that miracles do happen,” says Prateek Gupta of  ASC360 Insurance company.
It took Bielecki and Tashi four hours to find Anurag Maloo and get him out. Initially, they had thought he was not that deep in the crevasse, but soon they realised it was going to take some time to get him out.
“It was not easy to do what we did. This was my first time in the crevasse and there were moments that I felt like I would be stuck there,” says Tashi.
There was a moment when he felt it was going to be all over for him. As Anurag Maloo was helped out of the crevasse by Tashi and Bielecki, a small avalanche struck the crevasse while Tashi was still in it pushing him down.
“I was like this is it. But thankfully the rope did not break and I was able to get out. This rescue was scary, but we all are glad we played our part,” says Tashi.
But Anurag Maloo is still critical. Currently at Medicity Hospital in Lalitpur, his brother Ashish says the doctors are saying he is showing signs of improvement but adds he is still critical.
“We need people’s prayers. He is recovering but not out of danger,” says Ashish.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/anurag-maloo-rescue-annapurna-nepal.html,travel
Langtang valley trek: Once is not enough in the majestic land of the mountains,"Monday, April 24, 2023","After reaching the top of Kyanjin Ri 1 in Langtang, I was staring at another hill just as tall as the one I had taken 90 minutes to climb.
“That’s Kyanjin Ri 2 and above that is the summit of this hill,” said Sonam, our guide. “Do you want to go?”
Walking on the narrow ridgeline of Kyanjin Ri had been on my bucket list since 2017. Fast forward six years, and I was staring right at it. Did I want to go? Yes, I did. But as I walked along the trails of the Langtang valley trek and approached the narrow ridgeline on Kyanjin Ri, of which one side had been whipped out by a landslide, I froze.
Over the past three days prior to that moment, I was excited. People had been telling me and Swarup how dangerous the drop was from that particular part of the ridge.
“People look down and feel dizzy,” said one.
“I’ve seen grown men cry on that part,” said another.
Maybe it was a culmination of everything that was said to me because when I approached that climb, I started to second-guess myself. Over the years I have seen what happens to people who doubt themselves in the mountains and I turned back.
“Do you think we made the right call,” asked Swarup when we returned to the Langtang village.
Personally, I think we did. We had chosen the Langtang valley trek to be close to the mountains and at over 4,200 metres, we were more than close. Everywhere we looked, there were mountains. While Langtang Lirung stood out the most, our eyes were fixed on the peaks like Dorje Lakpa, Naya Kangri, Loenpo Gang, Changbu, Gangchenpo, Morimoto and Ganjala Peak.
It is safe to say that while the decision not to go to the top of Kyanjin Ri might haunt us in hindsight, I for one believe that climbing a few hundred metres more would not have changed the view significantly. It would sure have delayed the end-of-day drink in the Langtang village.
With a beer in hand, I had no regrets because all I was taking back from this trip was the view from Kyanjing Gumba and the memories I made during the Langtang valley trek.
The Langtang valley trek is one of the best commercial treks in Nepal. The trek begins at Syabru Besi in Rasuwa and takes you all the way to Kyanjin Gumba from where you can reach peaks like Kyangin Ri (4,700m) or the Tsergo Ri (5,100m). That is not all, you walk through different terrains to reach Kyangin which sits on one of the most beautiful valleys not just in Nepal but the world.
The Langtang trail starts off next to the Langtang river and takes you through the Langtang National Park walking through forests, crossing shady suspension bridges and multi-coloured rhododendron forests. The trail is probably the easiest in Nepal as there are only two major uphill climbs in the entire trek that takes you from the forests to above the treelines to the foothills of the mountain. It is truly an experience and one that I for one will experience once again.
The tea houses along the trekking trail are not very well equipped. They are basic, to say the least. After Syabru Besi, you do not get electricity until you get to Thangshep, so make sure you pack power banks or solar chargers. The tea houses are basic, so make sure that you prepare yourself mentally before heading to Langtang. You have to pay between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 for the rooms though. This goes both for domestic and foreign tourists.
Langtang National Park is the first Himalayan national park in the country. The flora and fauna in the national park are sure to leave you in awe during the Langtang valley trek. There are langurs flying from one tree to another and sightings of ghorals and danphes are also quite common. If lucky, you can also see the elusive snow leopards and the endangered red pandas.
Like most parts of the mountains, the people you meet during the Langtang valley trek are incredibly warm and hospitable. You do not see village life as there are only a few villages mostly at the end of the trek, but the people that you meet on the trail tell you all about the trek and how the place became so popular over the course of the past three decades. The people from the area are mostly Tamangs who migrated from Tibet centuries ago, but the region also has small Sherpa settlements with almost all of them Buddhists.
The food you get during the Langtang valley trek is quite delicious. You get a diverse range of dishes from dal bhat to tuna pizza. The best thing, however, is yak cheese, served with roasted potatoes, pasta or spaghetti. Seabuckthorn juice, made from a local berry that tastes like passion fruit, is another stellar treat.
As you climb high, the Langtang valley trek trail changes. The forests give way to something that not many people get to see. You have heard people say Nepal is like Switzerland, and when you start going above 3,000 metres, you realise that as the treeline ends and the mountains start to appear in your face. It is truly a trek that gives you memories (and pictures) for a lifetime. It is easy and in three days, you get a view of the mountains like no place else.
The highlight of the Langtang valley trek for me is Kyanjin Gumba. The place, set in a valley, will be with me for some time as will Kyanjin Ri. The climb to the hilltop is not an easy one. It is steep and offers some great views of the mountains.
The first peak, where I stood, offered breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan mountains, including Langtang Lirung, Dorje Lakpa, and Langshisha Ri. The panoramic views from the summit are truly spectacular.
Since you are climbing above 4,000 metres, the air does get thinner but once you reach the top, it is quite worth the push. Most people only go to the first peak at around 4,200 metres, but some venture out and head towards the second and final peak which offers a different perspective.
The trek for us ended at Langtang village. The village, before the 2015 earthquake, is believed to have been a lot different to the one I visited. As I walked towards the village, Sonam, our guide, pointed to the rubble we were walking on, stating many houses were buried there.
The village was known for its traditional houses, vibrant culture, and stunning natural beauty, but now things are very different. That said, the village still has its charm with old ladies basking in the sun, talking to each other and tourists passing by and yaks grazing on the green pasture.
The Langtang valley trek is easy. I had heard a lot about it for the past few years and when I actually trekked it, I realised how true every word was. Maybe it is a recency bias, but this is probably the best trek I have done. Some parts of the Annapurna Circuit were great, but Langtang is a trek that I will remember for years as I will probably go back again to climb the Tsergo Ri and maybe even to climb the top of Kyanjin Ri.

The Beni-Jomsom road, the only road to Muktinath, a famous pilgrimage site for Hindus and Buddhists in Mustang, is closed for five hours a day since Monday again. It will be in effect until May 3.
The transport service has been put on hold every day for the prevention of landslides at the Rupse fall area in Annapurna rural municipality-3 of Myagdi, the construction of a Bailey bridge and the expansion of the road network.
Myagdi Chief District Officer Tulsiram Poudel says the vehicular movement has been halted from 6:00 to 9:00 am and 1:00 to 3:00 pm. Earlier, transport service was brought to a halt in the Rupse section same time from March 17 to 28.
The road project says traffic operation has been disrupted along the road section as it was riskier to continue with the road, bridge construction and landslide prevention works in the narrowed space.
The vehicles en route to Mustang from Myagdi and vice versa should cross the Rupse road section before the closure of the traffic service.
However, the administration says it would arrange for the smooth movement of ambulances and vehicles for most-essential services and goods on the road to Muktinath.

Why Panchakoshi in Dailekh should be your next pilgrimage destination in Karnali,"Sunday, April 16, 2023","Located in the Karnali province, Dailekh is known for its scenic beauty. But the place is also rich in cultural heritage. Panchakoshi in Dailekh can be an example of this.
Dailekh is also famous for its Chaturmukhi Shiva temple, whose establishment dates back to the Lichhavi period. Many pilgrims also visit the Dullu Bajrayogini temple, which is dedicated to the Hindu goddess of power and is believed to be one of the oldest temples in Nepal.
That is not it. The place has many cultural and religious sites. It is safe to say that the place is ancient and the proof of that is the temples, shrines and stone inscriptions located in different places of the district, Panchakoshi in Dailekh being one of the most apparent examples.
According to religious accounts, Shirasthan, Nabhisthan, Dhuleshwar, Paduka and Tallo Dungeshwar, located in the Dailekh district, are famous as Panchakoshi pilgrimage sites.
Since there are constant burning flames in Panchakoshi in Dailekh, it is also known as Jwala Tirtha or Agni Tirtha. In Skanda Purana, an ancient Hindu epic, this area is described as Baishwanara Tirtha.
It is believed that the ancient Khas Malla kings named this shrine Panchakoshi and started their pilgrimage and since then the name has stuck. So far, this is the only place in Nepal where petroleum products can be extracted.
Although the origin of the Nepali language is considered to be Sinja in Jumla, the oldest record of the language can be found in the region of Panchakoshi in Dailekh.
Literally, Panchakoshi means five rivers. In Dailekh, the following five holy sites located near rivers are referred to as Panchakoshi collectively.
Located in Rawatkot of Dullu municipality, this temple is near the Shirasthan river. According to Swasthani, a Hindu epic, Shiva was carrying the remains of Sati Devi and travelling around, and Devi’s head (“shira” fell in this area.
In this area, there are other temples like Jwalaghar, Kalbhairav ​​Kalsaini, Batukbhairav, Shivling and Dharamshala.
The flame that burns continuously is being worshipped as a god for hundreds of years. If the fame runs out in the Chandannath temple in Jumla and Badimalika temple in Doti, the flame from Jwalaghar, Panchakoshi in Dailekh, is taken to light the flames.
Located in Gamaudi of Dullu municipality, this temple is near the Nabhisthan river. According to Swasthani, Sati Devi’s navel (“nabhi”) fell off in this area. Since then, the region has been called Nabhisthan.
Like Shirsasthan, Nabhisthan of Panchakoshi in Dailekh also has two places with flames coming out – Brahmajwala and Indrajwala. The area also has temples of Bhairav, Shiva and Mansaath as well as the famous shami tree (Prosopis cineraria). The tree said to be more than a hundred years old is one of the main attractions of Nabhisthan.
The 13th-century Dhuleshwar temple, located in Badlamji of Dullu municipality, is believed to be called Dhuleshwar because dust (“dhulo” in Nepali) flies on every full moon, no moon and the first day of the solar month.
Not only this, it is believed that this place was worshipped as Dhuleshwar of Panchakoshi in Dailekh because the ashes of Sati Devi’s body fell in the area.
In this area, there are idols of Umamaheswara, Shivaling, idols of Nandi the bull, Agni Kunda, the temple of Bhairava and a dharamshala. There is a tradition of performing pooja every day, but a special pooja is held during the Bada Dashain and Chaite Dashain festivals.
There are idols from the fourteenth century in Paduka of Dullu municipality. According to Swasthani, the legs (“pad”) of the Sati Devi fell here and due to that, the place is called Paduka.
Until a few decades ago, flames used to burn continuously in this area. But a flood in Panchakoshi in Dailekh has killed the flame.
There are no temples in the Paduka, but there are idols of Shiva, Bhairava, Gorakhnath, Buddha, Jain, Laxminaran, Ganesha, Machhindranath, Shivling etc. Because these idols are in the open, the sun and rain are damaging them day by day.
There is a tradition of offering khir to Shiva on the third Tuesday of May. Apart from that, locals conduct a special pooja on Bada Dashain as they offer the Bhairav a sacrifice.
There are old archives in the area dating back to Ashok Challa, an old Khas king.
Sidheshwar Mahadev is connected with Karnali Highway located in Katuwal in Dugeshwar rural municipality.
Apart from the Sidheshwar Mahadev temple at the confluence of the Kanarali and Loher rivers in Panchakoshi in Dailekh, there are temples of various deities including Kalika Bhagwati, Ganeshji, Bhairav ​​Kalashaini and Batuk Bhairav.
There is a tradition of lighting a lamp by bringing fire from Nabhisthan. There is a popular belief that if the lamp goes off, there will be unfortunate events such as drought, famine and starvation.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/panchakoshi-in-dailekh-pilgrimage.html,travel

Nepal opens Jugal mountain range for climbing,"Thursday, April 13, 2023","Kathmandu, April 13
The government of Nepal has opened the Jugal mountain range, so far known as the Virgin Mountain, for climbing.
A recent cabinet meeting decided to open the peaks of the range to domestic and foreign climbers. Reportedly, there are over 20 peaks at an altitude below 7,000 metres in the range located in the Jugal rural municipality in Sindhupalchok, which is just a few hours away from Kathmandu via road.
Local tourism entrepreneurs are hopeful that the government’s decision to open climbing on the peaks would give a new height to the district’s tourism industry.
As spring, the busiest mountaineering season in Nepal is here, the government is issuing dozens of climbing permits on a daily basis. Find the permit fee details here.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-opens-jugal-mountain-range.html,travel
From Kathmandu to Pokhara: Here’s the ultimate travel guide,"Thursday, April 13, 2023","Kathmandu and Pokhara are the two most visited cities in Nepal. While Kathmandu offers tourists a cultural experience in the midst of chaos, Pokhara, unofficially Nepal’s tourism capital, offers solitude and an atmosphere where you can loosen yourself.
The two cities are connected by multiple flights every day but there is a charm in travelling from Kathmandu to Pokhara by road as there are various activities you can indulge yourself in between.
Since the drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara is roughly seven to ten hours depending on road conditions and traffic, we have come up with a travel guide spanning a few days. So if you have the time to explore Nepal, this ultimate travel guide will take you to cable car rides, food hunts, temples and viewpoints that will make your journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara worth remembering for a lifetime.
Chandragiri is just an hour’s drive away from Kathmandu’s city centre. The hilltop offers a panoramic view of the Himalayas on the north and rolling hills to the south. It is an ideal place to stop for breakfast on your way from Kathmandu to Pokhara. The cable car up the hill starts at 8 am so get there early and grab your breakfast at the food stations up on the hill or at Chandragiri Hills Resort. If it is a clear day, you even get to see Everest from the hill.
After breakfast at Chandragiri, there are various options that you can choose from. But the best will be either stopping at Kurintar and its riverside hotels or taking another cable car up to Manakamana, a famous Hindu pilgrimage site. Both offer different experiences. At Kurintar, you can unwind in a pool and take a break from the windy highway. But Manakamana can give you a spiritual experience as you are close to an important deity that Hindus believe grants your wishes. The views from Manakamana are quite breathtaking too especially the sunrise.
If you decide not to stop at either Chandragiri or Kurintar during your journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara, you will have to stop and try the local fish items at Muglin or Malekhu. These fish items are so popular that almost everyone stops at either of the two places for lunch. While there was a time that the fish would be from Trishuli, the river that flows below the highway, the fish might not be local anymore but the taste certainly is.
A slight detour from Kathmandu to Pokhara can take you to Bandipur, an old Newa settlement on top of a hill. It is a hidden gem that not many people go to. The place has an essence not many cities in Kathmandu do. It gives you a blend of new and old and takes you down memory lane. It is a place that has retained its age-old cultural attributes – temples, shrines, sacred caves, innumerable festivals, and Newa architecture. The drive to Bandripur is quite scenic too and the views from the top will make you want to stay there for your entire Nepal stay.
Pokhara is a city that will make you wish you lived there. It has it all: mountains, lakes, temples and hills. There is so much you could do there. Given you have hired a car for your journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara, you can make use of it and drive around to see the lake cluster that surrounds the city. You can even go to the many landmarks in the area like Sarankot, Peace Pagoda and the Shiva statue at Pumdikot. You can also drive to Dhampus, a hill station north of Pokhara, from where you can get up close to the Annapurna range.
If you want to hire a car, you can do so at different shops around Thamel. The per day cost for a car depending on size is around Rs 5,000 to 10,000 a day.
If you do not wish to hire a car and spend a few days getting from Kathmandu to Pokhara, you can always take a bus. There are different options depending on what type of bus you want to take and what you want to pay. Normally, tourist buses leave from Sorakhutte, 10 minute walk from Thamel. These buses are clean, have air conditioning and charge anything between Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 depending on the size as you will find deluxe buses, VIP buses and sofa buses. Most of these buses leave by 8 am.
If you want a more local experience, cheaper buses from Kathmandu to Pokhara can be found at the New Bus Park in Balaju. You can ask people where you can find a bus to Pokhara and people will point you in the right direction. Mind you, these buses take a little longer to get to Pokhara and will cost nothing above Rs 1,000.
There is a third option – microbuses. These buses can be found from Kalanki and will zoom you through the highway in around 6 hours. These buses can be found in Kalanki throughout the day till the afternoon so if you miss the buses above, you always have a chance.
If you are a biker, you also have an option of renting a motorbike in Kathmandu and riding to Pokhara stopping wherever you please. This will give you a great idea of what Nepal’s roads are and how scenic they can get. The roads are not for the faint-hearted so only ride if you have prior experience riding in South Asia.
If you do not want to travel by road, you can always take the 30-min flight to Pokhara from Kathmandu. As mentioned above, over 20 flights fly to Pokhara from Kathmandu every day.
The bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara is going to be a long one and with no phone reception for some parts, it is better to be prepared on how you can pass your time. Sleeping is the best thing to do, but if you cannot sleep on the bus, it is better to download podcasts or Netflix shows on your phone to pass time.
It is also better to take snacks to munch off from Kathmandu as most buses stop in Nepali-friendly places to eat, which means oily and spicy food. Take chocolates and crisps for the journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara so you do not have to buy them for extortionate prices on the highway.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/from-kathmandu-to-pokhara-guide.html,travel

Kathmandu-Pokhara road upgradation would be over soon: Minister,"Sunday, April 9, 2023","Damauli, April 9
Physical Infrastructure and Transport Minister Prakash Jwala has pledged to accelerate the ongoing Muglin-Pokhara road widening project that has been affecting the journey along the Kathmandu-Pokhara road.
Talking to the media today in Damauli following the inspection of the project, the minister admitted the slow progress in the project implementation, underlining the need of speeding it up.
The part of Prithvi Highway is serving as the lifeline of the Gandaki province, he said, adding that the government was ready to lend all sorts of possible support to complete the project in time.
Following the inspection, it is found the progress of the West section (Pokhara-Jamune) is left behind.
The minister announced the ministry would do its best to accelerate the project.

"Meet 2 Nepali climbers for whom the Everest summit, your once-in-a-lifetime dream, is just a regular job","Friday, April 7, 2023","Pasang Dawa Sherpa and Ngima Nuru Sherpa are circumambulating the Bouddhanath Stupa. The two Nepali climbers stop at the Jamchen Lhakhang Monastery, light candles and burn incense. This has been their ritual every year before they climb Everest.
The two have climbed Everest 25 and 24 times respectively. During these accents, they have seen it all: deaths, accidents and triumphs. Their friends died in 2014 when an avalanche occurred at the Khumbu icefall and in 2015 when the earthquake triggered an avalanche at the base camp.
“A lot has changed, yet it’s constant that everything is so unpredictable in the mountains,” says Ngima Nuru.
For many, climbing Everest is a dream, an ultimate life goal. But for Pasang Dawa and Ngima Nuru, it is just a job. Over the past two decades, mountaineering in Nepal has evolved drastically and they two have seen it first-hand. They have seen how the gear has got better along with the technology. That is not all, they have also seen how Nepali climbers have evolved along with the impact global warming has had on the mountain and the challenges it has posed for them. But for the two, their role remains the same, take clients to the top of Everest and bring them back safely.
“Some things do not change,” Pasang Dawa.
These Nepali climbers started their careers in the late 90s in similar ways. Looking for jobs to make money, they two became trekking porters and then gradually made their way into the mountaineering scene initially by working in the base camp kitchen and then becoming climbing sherpas.
“Work was scarce back then. Unlike today, it was very hard to get into climbing, but we all knew the money was good,” says Ngima Nuru.
Like most people, money took them to the mountain, but that was not it, they two also wanted to climb because they wanted to follow in the footsteps of Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. They were also in awe of the gears that were used by their elders and always wondered if they would ever get a chance to climb like them.
Fast forward 20 years, and things have changed for these Nepali climbers. They feel things have changed for everyone not just them as the mountain has had a cultural change in the past two decades.
For starters, the base camp is a lot different to when they started, they say. The camp for a good part of their climbing careers was basic. The sleeping tents were normal, and the kitchen and dining tents were quite ordinary too.
But now, with service a key component of an expedition, things have changed. Ngima Nuru says there are now single rooms for clients who are willing to pay for them. These rooms have carpets and heaters and other amenities which in the 90s were unimaginable.
“The base camp is like a home and it has almost everything that a home does,” says Ngima Nuru.
That is not all, the kitchens and dining are well equipped too. Fresh meals fly in from Kathmandu every day on helicopters.
“There are ovens and coffee machines. Sometimes we are blown away by it too as it is really hard to take these items to base camp,” he says.
An upgrade in quality has meant the Nepali climbers now sleep in better tents too. While they do not get individual rooms like their foreign clients, they still get top-quality tents tested in the mountains.
Camp 2 on Everest is similar to the base camp and that has also changed over time with clients seeking luxuries there too.
“If they want it, we have to give it. If not, they will go elsewhere,” says Pasang Dawa.
But even though the clients look for more service, the mindset of the clients remains the same, feel these Nepali climbers.
“They wanted to reach the top in 1999 and they want to reach the top in 2023. Nothing has changed in that aspect. Better technology has only made things easier for us,” adds Pasang Dawa.
Both agree that the quality of ropes, rock pitons, ice crew, shoes and down suits are a lot better than two decades ago.
“The gear has come a long way,” he says.
Better equipment and access to technology have also made it easier for Nepali climbers. Ngima Nuru says while they struggled a lot to get jobs, things are different now with over 400 clients climbing Everest every year.
He says the new generation of climbers in Nepal have better communication skills thanks to education which means they can guide foreign clients better. He also believes mountaineering schools and YouTube has helped the new generation get better at climbing too.
But that said, both feel that the future of Nepali climbers from the Sherpa community, that have been the backbone of Himalayan mountaineering, is looking bleak.
“Climbers now are not as desperate as we were when we started climbing. They will climb for a few years and stop. I would have stopped too, but this is all I know,” says Pasang Dawa.
These Nepali climbers say the work is demanding mentally and physically. Ngima Nuru recalls how he cried because he was helpless when he was unable to carry a bag full of oxygen cylinders which he was supposed to drop off at camp 4.
“Those early years were so tough but I was something I had to do to make sure my family had a good life,” he says.
Now with the two going to Everest to climb one more time, the Nepali climbers do not know when they will stop. While there is a trend to climb for records, the two do not have that on their mind. They have reached the top not caring about it and even to this day, they climb to ensure they support their family.
“The number is what it is, just a number. We will do it till our body can then we relax in our villages in Khumbu,” says Pasanga Dawa.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepali-climbers-everest-regular-job.html,travel

Temples in Nepal: A guide to 14 most beautiful and historic religious sites,"Monday, April 3, 2023","Nepal is home to thousands of temples. These temples hold both cultural and historical significance in the country and are visited by pilgrims from both Nepal and India.
The temples in Nepal are energy centres that have a blend of art and culture that take back thousands of years. Apart from their unique designs, these temples are famous for their religious significance.
Many of the temples in Nepal are dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses, including Shiva, Vishnu, and Kali while others are dedicated to different forms of Buddha.
Most of the temples in Nepal are important centres of meditation and spiritual practice. Here are a few of them:
The Taleju temple stands out amongst all the temples in Kathmandu. Built in the 16th century by Mahendra Malla, the temple is home to Taleju Bhawani who was the royal goddess of the Malla kings back in the day. The temple is grand too as it stands on a 12-stage plinth and is also surrounded by 12 miniature versions of it. There was a time no building was bigger than this temple, which is still revered as one of the most powerful goddesses in the valley by locals. The temple is only open to the public once a year, during the ninth day of Dashain.
Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu is one of the most historic and popular temples in Nepal as millions of Hindu pilgrims come to visit the temple every year. The exact date the temple located on the banks of the Bagmati river was built is not clear, but many believe the current form was built in the late 17th century.
The temple alone is not the only attraction in the area as it is home to hundreds of shrines, inscriptions and ashrams set up some centuries ago, including the 11th-century Guhyeshwari temple. The evening arati on the banks of the river is something everyone can enjoy. People can also see the circle of life end at the eastern ghat where bodies are cremated. While the area is open to all, the temple is only open to Hindu pilgrims. This is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Built in the 6th century, the Bouddanath stupa is one of the most iconic monuments and temples in Nepal as it is a symbol of religious harmony and peace. The structure is a reminder for people about Buddha’s path towards enlightenment. Historians say the monument is three-dimensional as the plinth represents earth, the dome represents water and the tower represents fire. There is also a belief that the 13 levels of the spire represent the stages that a person needs to pass to achieve nirvana.
The UNESCO World Heritage site is always full of people circumambulating and chanting prayers. It is a place that will make you feel at peace and a place where you get to feel the presence of the Buddha. With cafes and restaurants all over the stupa, it also makes a great place for breakfasts and dinners.
Like the Bouddhanath stupa, the Swayambhunath stupa is another iconic Buddhist shrine in Kathmandu that shows the influence Buddhism had in the valley over 2000 years ago. One of the oldest temples in Nepal, Swayambhunath is set on top of a hill and is often called the Monkey Temple by tourists thanks to the population of rhesus monkeys on the hill. The place, like Bouddhanath, is full of people throughout the day as people often visit the temple to look over the city in the evening as you get a great panoramic view of Kathmandu.
If interested, you can hike up the hill by taking the 365 steps from the eastern side of the stupa and get to the top of the hill to the stupa and seek blessing from the five main shrines. Like Bouddhanath, Swyambhunath is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Changunarayan is one of the oldest temples in Nepal as it is one of the few Lichhavi-era temples still standing. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is one of four Vishnu temples that watch over the valley. Like Swayambhunath, the temple is perched up on a hill and overlooks the city of Bhaktapur. Changunarayan is surrounded by a champak tree forest and a small village known as Changu. There is a belief that a Kashmiri king married off his daughter, Champak, to the prince of Bhaktapur. The temple is considered to be named after her. This is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.
One of the most famous temples in Nepal, Dakshinkali is dedicated to the goddess Kali. It is believed Dakshinakali is the most popular form of Kali as she protects her devotees and children from mishaps and misfortunes. Many devotees visit Dakshinkali during Dashain, a festival that celebrates all nine forms of Durga and offers sacrifices like chickens and goats. People also visit the temple after they buy a new vehicle.
Up in the lap of the mountains lies Muktinath, one of the few temples in Nepal that both Hindus and Buddhists believe liberates a person from the cycle of birth and death. Located at an altitude of 3,710 metres in Mustang, the temple is dedicated to Vishnu. Apart from that, the temple is also home to 108 water sprouts that represent the 108 heads of lord Shiva. Near the temple is Jwalamai temple which has a perpetual flame burning from natural gas.
Manakama temple in Gorkha is another on the list of important temples in Nepal. Dedicated to Bhagawati, there is a belief among Hindus that she will fulfil the desire of devotees if they visit her with a pure heart and mind. The temple is located on a picturesque hill that can be reached both by hiking and on a cable car. The temple is roughly four hours from Kathmandu.
Halesi Mahadev is considered the Pashupatinath of eastern Nepal, and this title tells it is one of the most important temples in Nepal. The temple lies inside a beautiful and mysterious natural cave on the top of a small hill, through which two rivers–Dudhkoshi and Sunkoshi–flow. Apart from being an important temple in Nepal, it is also a touristic place as it has over 100 caves and caverns, some of which are interconnected. There is a belief these caves were used for meditations by sages centuries ago.
Pathibhara is another temple in Nepal that is both a pilgrimage and a touristic haven. The panoramic view of the Himalayas is quite amazing from the temple. But people do not go there for the view. There is a belief that like Manakamana, Pathibhara Devi also grants the wishes of people who come to her with a pure heart. The journey to Pathibhara is not easy so it is recommended people take a helicopter ride to the top.
Kalinchok temple is quite similar to Pathibhara and it holds the same importance but the place is quite different. Kalinchok is also perched on a hill and is home to a reincarnation of Kali. It offers pilgrims a mix of spirituality, natural beauty and adventure. While there is an option to hike up to the temple, a cable car service has made things easier for everyone. While going to Kalinchok, make sure you stay at Kuri which becomes a skier’s paradise when it snows.
Because it is quite close to Kathmandu despite being in the mountains, Kalinchok is one of the most visited temples in Nepal of late.
Janaki Mandir is one of the most important temples in Nepal’s southern plains. The temple is dedicated to King Janak’s daughter Sita, who was Ram’s wife. The temple has its own history in Hindu holy books, but the architecture of the temple is amazing as it has a blend of both Mughal and Rajput styles. The temple is worth a visit during special occasions like Ram Nawami and Vivah Panchami when the entire place is decorated with lights and flowers and special events are held every day.
Parashuram Dham is located on the bank of the Mahakali in the Dadeldhura district of far-west Nepal. It is one of the most important temples in Nepal’s western frontier. It is home to the sixth incarnation of Vishnu. Parashuram Dham is worth a visit during Maghe Sankranti (winter solstice) every year as a big fair is held with pilgrims from all over Nepal coming to the place. The place is also the place where the Rangun from the Mahabharat range, the Shyama from Manasarovar, the Sarayu and the Mahakali rivers meet.
Mayadevi Temple in Lumbini is a Buddhist temple which is built to commemorate the place Gautam Buddha was born two millennia ago. The temple is next to a sacred pool and garden which was visited by Mayadevi, Buddha’s mother, before giving birth. The place is a UNESCO World Heritage site and covers around 50 acres and has several monasteries and temples.

Guerrilla trek: Nepal’s unexplored trekking trail tests your navigation skills,"Friday, March 31, 2023","We got lost!
We could not find the trail ahead nor could we see anyone. All we could see were mountains and hills. We did not know where we were or where we were going. We were lost!
Our plan for the day was to get from Maikot in Rukum to Dule along the guerrilla trek trail. It was a steep uphill climb. Halfway up the climb, we missed the trail and did not know where to go. We soon realised going uphill does not necessarily mean you reach the destination.
The trails around Dola are not easy. We learnt that the hard way. It is not as popular as others and it does not have tea houses along the way.
Our plan was to get to Dule and stay there for the night before heading forward via the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. We thought the trip would get easier from then on.
But we got lost. We got lost in the wild forests between Dule and Maikot. Not only did we lose our way, we even lost our fellow trekkers who had made the journey together in the morning.
We did not have phone reception. All we could do was shout to communicate. But at one point, even that stopped as we got divided into two groups. Desperate to be found, we started climbing to the top where we found cell phone reception and made contact with the other group.
It was 7:30 pm. It was cold. It was very cold. We found a deep corner where there was no wind, collected dry leaves and dung and lit a fire to stay warm. We had contacted the other group but had no clue where they were.
We got a call from them. “We found a shed. We also found water. We should stay the night here,” said our friend.
I was relieved. I was tired. We all were. But the phone call gave us renewed energy and hope that we could complete the guerrilla trek and we headed up and started yelling. They heard us and responded by flashing lights at us.
But they were around two hours away from us. I thought maybe they were not our group. But they were and as they were around two hours downhill, I did not want to move.
I was angry. I then asked Krishna if he would go to Dule with him as I guessed Dule was only three hours away from where we were.
After our stubbornness, the group that was down started climbing up. Telling them to come slowly, we headed towards Dule.
But we got lost along the guerrilla trek. Again. In the wild in the dark.
After walking up for a while, we realised we took the wrong trail. I felt how anger was bad for my health. I realised had only two of us walked up, we would have been lost. Maybe for good.
As we found our way to the correct trail, we met the other group.
They took a shortcut and found the trail that headed to Dule.
As this was a new place for us, we had taken three porters with us from Maikot to help us with the trail and our bags. But they were with the latter group.
It was 11:30 at night. We were still in the jungle. We had not eaten anything. We had not even had a drop of water for hours.
Walking in the dark, we saw a few houses. Dule was in front of us. There was an eerie silence.
We were happy to see the houses but soon our happiness turned into sadness as we realised there was no one in the village. They left the village to escape the winter.
But we were hungry, thirsty and tired. We had to get in and finally found a way into one house. We were so desperate that we were willing to break in. Technically, we did break in.
We then split up. Some fetched firewood while others started to look for water. We ate noodles we had carried and some local liquor and slid into our sleeping bags and slept.
The night was really cold. I woke up at 2:30 am and could not sleep. I went out, started the fire and sat by it the entire night.
People started to wake up one after another. As everyone got up, we started our journey.
The uphill was misty. We were all tired. We had not had proper food, which made walking extremely difficult. But we had finally made our way to the Guerrilla trail.
The trail was better than what we had taken earlier. It was well-marked and had enough resting spots. I felt that the journey would be far better now.
When we told the locals we were taking the trail to reach Dunai, many discouraged us, but we were not backing down.
In our team, Raju is an experienced trekker. I had also done the Annapurna and Manaslu circuits and trekked high passes before. I was confident we could do the guerrilla trek too.
We started the trek uphill. The trail was easy. Stopping and resting gradually, we started walking up. The three porters were reluctant to carry on so we bid them farewell and took the trail to Dolpa via Yangkhar, hoping to reach by 11 pm.
Everyone had a spring in their step. Everyone was in the mood to have fun. Listening to music and singing along, we started our trek with renewed energy. I do not know how did we get the energy, but it was great to see everyone in a mood to walk.
Nisan and Saroj climbed up the hill briskly. When I caught up with them at the top, they were having a blast looking at the panoramic view of the mountains. We were surrounded by mountains.
But we soon realised we were lost again.
“The trail ends here,” said Nisan.
When Nisan said that, we were all shocked. When we looked down, we saw Dule, where we had spent the night.
We then started to get down again. We were extremely hungry. The water we carried finished. As a result, we put snow in our botters and used it to quench our thirst during the rest of our guerrilla trek.
It was 2 pm. We had walked for hours, but there were no homes or people in sight. We wanted to eat but we did not have an option. But we finally found water.
After eating some snacks, we started to take uphill towards Pupal.
We were climbing a hill where people climbed to collect yarsagumba. We had to cross the Sisne Pass and the Jang La Pass via Pupal Lake. All of these were over 4,500 metres high.
It was 6 pm. Saroj and I reached Pupal Lake. Others were behind us. Raju and others arrived after an hour.
“Nisan is having issues due to the altitude,” said Raju.
Saroj went down to get Nisan as we waited for them to come up.
An uneasy chill flowed through my body. If he was having a hard time, it was going to be difficult for us to continue. There was no way to call for help either as there was no cell reception.
Nisan and Saroj came up at around 6:45 pm. Nisan looked well. He was tired but he seemed okay. But the guerrilla trek ahead was going to be tough as we had to go through the Yamkhar ridge, which was one of the steepest hills we had come across in the trek.
The mountains were sparking in the moonlight. We were walking based on instinct as there was snow everywhere.
It was dark. Our lights had stopped working due to the cold. We were forced to use our phones to show us the way. As the battery started to drain, we were desperate to reach a place where we could rest.
With the battery dead, we could not even check the time. As per our estimation, it was around 10 pm. Like everyone else, I also fell. My bag went one way, the stick another and me another. I was falling down, my life flashed before my eye as I started remembering my family. I was hanging on and a part of me felt this was it. If I did not hold on, I would fall some 800 metres below.
My friends took a long time to pull me up. As I got back up, my body started to shiver. It was cold but it was also due to fear.
We did not know what to do with the rest of our Guerrilla trek plan. We could not stay as there was no place to sleep and we could not go on as the trail was not clear.
We came across a river. A part of me felt glad that I had not fallen off a cliff. But then walking on the iced river was equally daunting as I felt we could fall into it.
We started to head up again. As we started climbing the hill, we saw how that was the only hill around the area without snow.
We climbed the hill hoping to find a solution, but we were even more confused. On one side we saw landslides and on the other side, we saw a gorge.
It was cold. We were hungry and thirsty. We could barely move as we did not have the energy to do so. There was no place to sit down nor did we find water to drink. We were so cold we were soon on the verge of turning into snow ourselves.
We decided to stay on the hill. We did not know if we would see the morning, but we had no choice but to stay there.
The wind was constant. We were in the open at around 4,300 metres. Maybe it was fate, it did not snow that night. But it was cold and windy. We survived.
We started walking along the guerrilla trek trail again. We reached the base of Jang La and saw a stream where we drank water constantly.
All our snacks had finished. We had some leftover biscuits and chocolates and shared them among us. That was our breakfast and lunch.
Then started the uphill to Jang La. We were almost certain we would find a village after Jang La. We reached the top. We were sick of snow and mountains. We wanted to rest and eat but then we got lost. Again.
The other side of the pass does not see the sun as much. The snow there was thick. And it was hard to estimate where to go. We saw a green forest and that became our target.
We know that passes should be crossed before noon. But by the time we crossed it, it was already dark.
I was at the front. I was hoping to meet someone to get information. The guerrilla trek had been about hope after all.
We saw some prayer flags and thought we had reached a village. We were wrong.
It was 7 pm, another day we had been walking in the dark. We did not have lights nor did we have phones. We kept on walking and finally saw some light.
We saw a white horse gazing far away and started to walk towards it. But that horse, like us, was lost.
After hours of walking, we finally reached Tupisera village. We were looking for refuge, but many were reluctant. One guy finally agreed and we had a place to sleep. We even got to charge our phones as the place had electricity thanks to a micro hydro project.
Sandesh called. They were behind us and we asked a few locals to go help them. After two hours, they arrived.
After that, we did not get lost through the guerrilla trek. We reached Dunai and capped off what was a difficult but unforgettable trek.
This is a trek that will remain with me forever.

No international flights from/to Pokhara until October,"Thursday, March 30, 2023","Kathmandu, March 30
It is almost certain that Pokhara’s new international airport will not see any international flights at least until October 28, 2023.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has published a schedule of international flights approved for the summer (March 26-October 28), according to which no company has received approval for carrying out international flights at Pokhara airport.
Whereas the Kathmandu airport has been the most favoured destination for international carriers, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa will see regular flights from foreign countries.
Jazeera Airways will take three flights a week from Kuwait City to Bhairahawa. Similarly, Nepal Airlines will fly from Bhairahawa to Kuala Lumpur twice a week.

10 permit-free trekking destinations in Nepal for once-in-a-lifetime adventures,"Thursday, March 30, 2023","Trekking in Nepal might be your dream-come-true moment, but the red tape involved in obtaining a permit might frustrate you beforehand. Many of the popular trekking destinations are in protected and conservation areas, which require permits from different levels of regulators. Yet we are not discouraging you from your plan as there are many other permit-free trekking destinations in Nepal.
Most of these places are hidden gems that are full of domestic trekkers as only a few foreigners venture out to the unknown. Some of these places are not well marked and the chances of getting lost are quite high. These places also do not have the amenities available in places like Annapurna or Everest regions. But what they lack in basic amenities is made up for in magnificent views of mountains and valleys.
So if you are a trekker or a group of trekkers looking for an adventure without a guide in permit-free trekking destinations, these routes should definitely be on your list.
The Panch Pokhari trek is one of the most underrated treks in the country. The trek offers great views of the Jungal mountain range and is only around three days away from Kathmandu despite being 4,400 metres high. The place has five ponds located at 4,000 metres and above and offers jaw-dropping sunrise and sunsets.
As with most permit-free trekking destinations, one of the downsides here is lodges do not have individual rooms as you will have to sleep in communal halls but this trek. But it is a place that will leave you wanting more.
The trek is ideal for camping.
Difficulty: Moderate
Close to Panch Pokhari is Ama Yangri, an incredibly underrated and permit-free trekking destination in the country. So this is another trek very close to Kathmandu. The place is basically a hilltop at 3,771 metres from where you can see rangers like Langtang, Manaslu and Annapurna. Some even see Everest from here. This is also a three-day trek from Kathmandu and has very basic lodges.
Difficulty: Moderate
Talking Everest, Pikey Peak is one of the best places to see Everest apart from the Khumbu region. Located in lower Solukhumbu, the hill offers magnificent views of the surrounding hills and mountain ranges. People often rave about the sunrise seen from Pikey Peak. If done fast, the trip to this permit-free trekking destination can be finished in five days.
If you want to start and end your trek in Pokhara, the Panchase trek is ideal. It takes you to the outskirts of Pokhara as you walk through the hills surrounding Pokhara. The trek offers beautiful scenery and views of the Annapurna range. This trek will finish in three days so if you are short on time, this is ideal.
Difficulty: Moderate
This is probably the easiest permit-free trekking destination in Nepal. The trail is ideal for camping as the place does not have many tea houses. But what it offers is great views of Everest, Gauri Shankar, Dorje Lakpa, Langtang range, Ganesh Himal and Manaslu. There is also a 600-year-old monastery in the region as you make your way to Sailung Peak. This trek is best done in groups.
Difficulty: Easy
Khumai Dada is a recently developed trekking route around Pokhara. It is a trek just north of Pokhara from where you get to see an up-close view of Machhapuchhre. It is part of the Machhapuchhre Model Trek which will need a permit, Khumai Danda alone is still a permit-free trekking destination. It is an underrated route and probably of the prettiest around Pokhara from where you see other mountains like Annapurna, Lamjung and Korchan.
Difficulty: Easy
Mundhum Trail is not for the faint-hearted. Located in eastern Nepal, this trail passes through remote Nepal and will give you a sense of adventure as you will really have to concentrate to ensure you are on the trail. The trail has been used by locals for years but has only opened up to trekkers since 2018. It is a trail that even Nepalis rarely trek on as it is both difficult and confusing. The views, however, the views of low mountain ranges and the southern plains make up for a joyous trek.
Difficulty: Hard
This is another tough route. Located in the remote parts of western Nepal, Guerrilla Trek is the route used by the Maoist rebels when Nepal was going through the civil war. Trekking this route will give you a feeling of how the rebels commuted as the terrains are rugged and harsh. This permit-free trekking destination, however, does offer some panoramic views of mountains and hills and is untouched by modernisation.
Difficulty: Very hard
Both Kapuche Lake and Kori Danda are located in the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, but there are no offices to check for TIMS permits. Both these areas are unique from each other. Kapuche is the lowest glacial lake in Nepal and is a day’s walk from Sikles. Kori, at an altitude of 3,800 metres gets you up close with Lamjung Himal and Annapurna II (7937m).
Difficulty: Kapuche – Easy / Kori Danda – Hard
Another area that is located in the ACAP region but still a permit-free trekking destination as mentioned above is Khopra. If you can get to Ghorepani, you can get to Khopra Danda easily. The place offers great views of Dhaulagiri and is within touching distance of Annapurna South. There is a lake at a day’s walking distance from Khopra Danda that will give you views that you will remember for a lifetime.
Difficulty: Moderate",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/permit-free-trekking-destinations.html,travel
"No guide, no trek: Will the new decision save or spoil the Nepal tourism industry?","Wednesday, March 29, 2023","Starting April 1, foreigners will no longer be allowed to trek without a guide. The decision by Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) has received the ire of many solo travellers and jubilation from trek guides.
Like with several other decisions taken by the NTB over the years, the intention remains at best misplaced. This is not to say that the ‘no guide, no trek’ policy is bad for the Nepal tourism industry per se. If Nepal wants to adopt a more philanthropic mode of tourism that caters to domestic employment, that is a separate topic.
However, to resort to the safety and employment arguments and make a hasty decision without consulting tourists, the very people the NTB wants to dearly protect, and other important stakeholders of the tourism industry reeks of a lobbied intervention with short-sighted opportunism and greed. In the name of protecting the tourists, NTB is on the verge of hurting the entire Nepal tourism industry.
When a country cannot boast about what it creates, it has to resort to what it is endowed with. Even amidst the corruption and chaos that surrounds and stymies Nepali society, there is little doubt that the country reveals some of the most breathtaking faces of nature. It is therefore perfectly understandable for Nepal to try and use that endowment with the expectation of economic benefit.
But there is a thin line between utilising and exploiting a benefit from the Nepal tourism industry and the new rule leans towards the latter. And maybe what makes it more of an exploitation rather than utilisation seems to stem from a few misconceptions.
One of them has to do with the portrayal of a classic ‘tourist’, prevalently referred to as ‘khaires’. To most, the word ‘tourist’ implies someone who is white and rich and it is generally a causal link that is presumed; they are rich because they are white. Leaving aside the subtle racism inherent in the way tourists are addressed based on the colour of their skin, treating them as a homogenous group with the same level of affluence is ignorant of the reality of life abroad.
Every society is stratified and those who are universally referred to as tourists in the Nepal tourism industry are from different economic spectrums in their countries of origin, not all of whom enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Like in every country, including the rich, there are people who have to work hard to make ends meet.
Granted that being from a more economically affluent country gives them some advantage, primarily through the means of favourable exchange rates, but the cost of travel, when including airfares, can still add up to a significant amount.
As such, a great many solo travellers adopt a lifestyle that requires them to be meticulous in terms of the money they spend so as to sustain their travel which is not just a one-off experience but a recurring lifestyle pattern.
This especially holds true for young travellers under the age of 35. There are those who think that Nepal is better off catering to only high-end tourists, but they fail to see that it will be small enterprises in our country that will also suffer the consequences.
Surely, Nepal Tourism Board must also be a little worried about the small tea houses and shops during the off-season when the ‘high-quality’ tourists go absent and solo travellers tend to step in. Because the debate has become so centred on trek guides and tourists, the rest of the stakeholders from the Nepal tourism industry have not had the chance to be addressed.
Some travellers might not mind taking a guide if it helps create employment, but people travel with a variety of different motivating factors, not all of which includes philanthropy. Some just want to break from their own stress, not accumulate more along the way.
This is especially true for those who go into nature-seeking moments for themselves where they can disconnect from everything else. Tourists do not work for our government and they should not be guilt-tripped into solving our employment problem. And the thing is, the new rule is not really going to solve the employment problem. This brings us to another misconception about the Nepal tourism industry which has to do with calculations.
The head of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal, Nilhari Bastola claimed more than 50,000 jobs would be added because of the new rule. There is no need to ask for the source of that estimate because there is not any. What he probably used was the number of FIT (free individual trekker) permits granted in 2019, which was about 46,000.
To assume that 50,000 jobs will be created from that number following the new rule requires an imaginative use of implausible hypothetical scenarios. To be fair, the head of the TAAN did not mention a time period so it might as well be an accurate prediction within ten years.
What Nepal Tourism Board needs to look at is the FITs issued in 2022, which was about 19,000, and estimate how much of that will be transferred or lost. And will the benefit trickle down to the guides or will the agencies gobble up the profit like they tend to? Also, what about the nature of employment? Because among the biggest issues facing trek guides is with regard to seasonal employment and this rule will be of little help in that matter.
The thing is, no proper research that addresses every stakeholder in the Nepal tourism industry has been carried out and as such both sides can use whatever secondary data is available and make inferences from them.
The industry is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. The tourism revival plan envisions the period of 2023-2032 as the tourism decade but this rule, instead of facilitating, serves as an impediment to the plan.
Nepal Tourism Board should focus on what it is supposed to focus on, which is, as quite rightly mentioned on its website, to make Nepal an attractive tourist destination and let the security forces worry about security issues. Perhaps this is the point where the advocates of the new rule would use the safety argument.
In a free country, how much risk to take in life is up to the individual’s discretion. A single waiver that acknowledges potential risks is more than enough. This is not a war zone where the threat is human-made. And besides, limiting a person’s freedom is not the only way of ensuring safety.
Also, if the rule is to go through the Nepal tourism industry and is implemented, more clarity is needed. The blanket ban implies that all trekking regions require the same level of caution, which is not remotely true. Will a bus ride and an hour’s hike to Ghandruk also require a guide? What about a ride to Manang and a day hike? Or a hike up to Shivapuri or a destination as straightforward and popular as Ghorepani?
And what about repeat travellers who have done the same trek numerous times? What about going to a hilly village situated within a national park? Or outside it? Or being accompanied by a Nepali national who is not a certified guide?
April 1 is already on the horizon and there is still a lot of confusion. The ministry needs to step up, clarify and take control because at this rate the board will sabotage the Nepal tourism decade plan before it even takes off.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/guide-must-nepal-tourism-industry.html,travel
Fixing problems with old fixed ropes on Everest: A vow to take them down to set a precedent,"Tuesday, March 28, 2023","“Everest is full of waste. It is the world’s highest garbage dump.”
As hundreds of climbers reach the base of the highest mountain on earth every spring, this statement is repeated in both national and international media outlets. The statement holds true too as waste like human faeces, kitchen waste, shoes, socks, wrappers, tents and old fixed ropes have piled up in the mountain over the past 70 years.
Ever since Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary reached the top of Everest, over a thousand people have followed in their footsteps. While a few have climbed the mountain differently, around 80 per cent or more have used fixed ropes on Everest.
These ropes have been a boon to Himalayan climbing. But it has a downside. Since they are fixed, these ropes stay on the mountain forever and no one brings them down as tons of old fixed ropes have been on the mountain for decades.
“The companies pay us to fix them to the top. We have never been asked to bring them down,” says a Nepali climber who has led the rope-fixing team in the past.
This year, however, things are looking different. Imagine Nepal and its team of climbers led by IFMGA guide Dawa Gyalje Sherpa are planning to bring down old fixed ropes on Everest. The team has won the bid to fix ropes to the summit of Everest and wants to bring back old ropes to set a precedent for the future and play their part in cleaning the mountain.
“This should have been done a long time back but no one has done it. It’s difficult, yes. But it’s not impossible,” says Dawa Gyalje.
Fixed ropes are an important part of Everest. These ropes have helped thousands fulfil their dream and reach the summit of Everest. These ropes are essential not only for foreigners but also for Nepali porters who carry around 40 kilograms of weight up the mountain.
But now with old ropes on Everest piling up, things are becoming risky. Dawa Gyalje says he has seen many people’s crampons being entangled in old ropes and falling down. He has also seen people having minor accidents by holding onto an old rope instead of the new one.
“When you’re climbing in altitude, you get tired quite easily. This is when people grab hold of old ropes which causes risk of accidents in the mountain,” he says.
Incidents like these have been seen on K2, the second-highest mountain in the world, where people have fallen to their death.
“The situation on K2 is so dire and we want to make sure that it is not the case with old ropes on Everest,” says Dawa Gyalje.
He says the team is planning to bring down around 4,000-metre ropes from the mountain mostly from its rocky areas.
“We will bring down old ropes that we can and are visible.”
But he understands it is not going to be as easy and has prepared his team accordingly. Dawa Gyalje is preparing a team of 10 people for the task at hand this season.
Their main challenge will be the weather. They understand some ropes on Everest will be stuck under snow which will be hard to remove along with those that have been frozen.
“There are ropes that have been there for years and its knots are so tight it will be hard for us to cut through. But we will go there prepared,” he says.
Dawa Gyalje says his team did this on Ama Dablam in 2021 when they removed around 500 metres of rope from the rocky section of the mountain.
“The mountain looked so clean,” he says.
Now with their plan to remove old ropes, he feels other expedition agencies that fix ropes on Everest or any other mountains follow their suit.
“We need to respect our mountains and work together to clean them. We need rules like those in South America where mountains are a lot cleaner compared to Nepal.”
Ropes on Everest are fixed by two different parties. Ropes from the Khumbu Icefall to Camp II are fixed by icefall doctors hired by the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC). The rest of the mountain is then fixed by one member of the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal, usually selected through an open bidding process
For many years, the company submitting the lowest bid got the contract but this year, things have been done differently as the company submitting the third lowest bid got the contract.
“This was to ensure quality was not compromised when fixing the ropes,” says Mingma G Sherpa, whose company Imagine Nepal will be fixing the ropes this year.
The total cost of ropes on Everest and other equipment ranges anything between 5 to 6 million rupees (USD 50,000) as eight to ten people are needed to do it.
Dawa Gyalje says he is excited to be fixing the ropes and wants to do it fast but knows things are not in their hands.
“The weather is very unpredictable, but we want to do it as fast as we can so that people can climb the mountain in small groups like they did last year,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/removing-fixed-ropes-on-everest.html,travel

With its stunning natural beauty, spiritual connections, and opportunities to learn new skills, it is easy to see why trekking in Nepal is a unique experience for female travellers.
To make your trekking journey in Nepal a success, here are some tips to keep in mind:
A trekker admiring the stunning views in the Mustang region.
The first step in preparing for a trekking journey for female trekkers in Nepal is to choose the right trekking route. From the moderate and accessible Annapurna circuit to the more challenging Everest base camp trek, there are various trekking options to suit different levels of experience and physical fitness. It is important to choose a route that is within your ability level, and that is well-suited to the time frame you have available.
Once you have chosen the best trekking route for you, it is important to ensure that you have the appropriate gear and safety equipment. The right clothing and equipment will ensure the comfort and safety of female trekkers in Nepal. Make sure to bring quality hiking boots, sturdy trekking poles, warm layers, and a waterproof jacket. It is also important to bring a first-aid kit and a communication device.
Hiring a guide is a great way to make the experience of female trekkers in Nepal more enjoyable and safe. A local guide will have an in-depth knowledge of the terrain and the local culture, and they can provide invaluable insight and advice. Having a guide also makes it easier to navigate the routes and stay on track.
When trekking in Nepal, it is important to be mindful of the local culture and customs. Respect the local people and their land, and be aware of any local etiquette. Be sure to follow any rules and regulations in place to protect the environment, and always be respectful of the local wildlife.
Acclimatisation is an important factor for female trekkers in Nepal. The high altitudes and extreme weather can make it difficult for some people to adjust. It is important to take your time and be aware of the signs and symptoms of altitude sickness. Stay hydrated, eat nutritious meals, and rest whenever possible. If you experience any difficulty breathing or other symptoms of altitude sickness, seek medical help immediately.
Health and hygiene are also important considerations for female trekkers in Nepal. It is important to bring a first-aid kit and to take the necessary precautions to avoid getting sick. Be sure to wash your hands regularly, drink only purified water, and avoid eating uncooked or undercooked food. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the risk of dehydration and to stay hydrated throughout your journey.
When trekking in Nepal, it is important to plan for your budget and accommodation. Trekking can be expensive, so it is important to research the cost of food, accommodation, and other necessities before you start your journey. It is also important to book your accommodation in advance, as finding accommodation during peak seasons can be difficult.
For female trekkers in Nepal, it is important to stay connected during trekking. Make sure to bring a cell phone or satellite phone and check in periodically with family and friends. Additionally, bring a power bank or solar charger to keep your electronic devices charged.
Travel insurance is an essential part of any trekking journey in Nepal. Make sure to purchase a travel insurance policy that covers medical expenses, emergency evacuation, and lost or stolen items.
From the stunning mountain views to the vibrant culture, there is no better way to explore all that this amazing country has to offer. Just make sure you come prepared – after all, it is not just about the right clothing and essential items, there are a few special considerations for female trekkers in Nepal.
First and foremost, make sure you know the local dress code. While you might be used to wearing the latest fashion trends back home, the traditional Nepali style might look a little different. Don’t worry – with a little research, you will be able to find the perfect outfit! Of course, safety should always be your top priority.
Important: Nepal Tourism Board has stepped in to make sure that trekkers do not have to worry about going it alone – solo trekking is banned from April 1, so you have to hire a local guide. But that is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with having a knowledgeable companion.
Finally, make sure you are aware of the risks that can come with trekking at high altitudes. Altitude sickness and dehydration are two of the most common health issues that can arise, so make sure you stock up on the necessary supplies and take the necessary precautions to stay safe.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/female-trekkers-in-nepal-checklist.html,travel
Chitwan aspires to replace Pokhara as Nepal’s most favoured paragliding destination,"Sunday, March 19, 2023","Chitwan, March 19
Chitwan, already a popular destination among tourists visiting Nepal, will boast the adventurous sport of paragliding, from April 14, 2023.
Nepal’s tourism capital Pokhara has long been considered the most attractive paragliding destination in Nepal, but a new international airport built there has virtually closed the activity there.
In this context, Chitwan can be the next most favoured destination for paragliding, hence the district will start it on the occasion of Nepali New Year, informs Bijaya Ghale, the chairperson of Himalayan Frontiers Paragliding Company Pvt Ltd.
“If you fly here at a height, you can see mountains as you can from Pokhara. The Trishuli river can remind you of the Phewa lake. There are green forests around,” he says, “I think this project will add an attractive tourism package to Chitwan.”
The company says the paragliders will take off from Chaukidanda and Kabilas of Bharatpur metropolitan city-29 of Chitwan and land on the bank of the Trishuli river in Devghat of the neighbouring Tanahun district.
Test flights have already been successful.
The company says it is investing Rs 700 million in developing Chitwan as a paragliding destination. Ghale says his company is recruiting 10 paragliding pilots in the first phase.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/chitwan-nepal-paragliding-destination.html,travel
"Solo trekking ban may ensure safety and produce jobs tomorrow, but it’s chasing trekkers away now","Friday, March 17, 2023","Tom Roberts was excited to trek the Annapurna circuit in Nepal this spring. Planning his second trip to the mountainous country, Robert planned to spend over a month exploring many hidden valleys and lakes in the region.
“I first saw photographs of the trek during my first time in Nepal when I went to the Annapurna base camp. I did not have time to go back then so I had planned a long trip to explore the region this time,” says Roberts from his home in France.
But on March 3, he was left disappointed after reading that Nepal Tourism Board decided to make guides mandatory on all treks in national parks and conservation areas, thereby banning solo trekking, in Nepal from April 1.
This meant Roberts had to hire a guide to trek the Annapurna circuit as the government would not issue a TIMS permit, which is mandatory on the trek, without a guide.
“This was a shock. How can they take such a decision on the eve of the trekking season? It’s such unwelcoming news for a solo trekker like me.”
Roberts treks alone not because he does not have money; he loves the feeling of doing solo trekking. He loves the freedom of being able to do as he pleases and stop where he pleases. But now with the new rule of mandatory guides, he has decided to not come to Nepal immediately but instead to travel elsewhere.
“I’ll go trek in India as it has been on my bucket list for some time. Why come to a country that does not want solo travellers anyway,” says Roberts.
The decision to ban solo trekking in the country has drawn flack from travellers across the world. There are many independent tourists like Roberts who have decided to cancel their trekking plans in Nepal due to the rule. Many cancelled as the rule affected the freedom of movement while some cancelled due to additional costs for the guides. Now, it will be interesting to see how it affects the rural parts of the country that are heavily dependent on tourists for their income.
The tourism board says the solo trekking ban decision was taken after years of discussion and was being implemented for the benefit of tourists.
“Many solo trekkers go missing every year. This rule will help us stop that. It is for the benefit of the tourists and the country’s economy,” says NTB director Maniraj Lamichhane.
Nepal sees a large number of solo trekkers as it saw around 50,000 in 2019 and nearly 20,000 in 2022. The board says around 10-15 of these trekkers go missing every year.
Tourism entrepreneurs argue that many go missing as they miss trails while some even die due to lack of immediate care.
“A guide can save lives,” Nilhari Baskota, the president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN), an umbrella organisation of trekking agents in the country, told Onlinekhabar a month back. “This will also generate a lot of employment in Nepal.”
When asked if the decision to ban solo trekking will drive away tourists as the cost will rise, Baskota said it was time the country moved up from being treated as a cheap destination.
“People pay so much to go to Bhutan. But we have Everest, the highest mountain in the world. People will pay anything to come see that,” he said.
Many agencies, who will benefit from this new rule, say the rule makes sense in more than one way. Raju Gurung, who owns a trekking agency says the rule is not there to help them earn more but as mentioned above by the NTB, to save lives.
“The trekkers aren’t the same as before. A lot of them are inexperienced and don’t know how to tend to themselves if a crisis arises,” says Gurung. “The blanket ban was necessary.”
But for people like Tim McDaniels who has been solo trekking all his life, this ban does not make sense.
“I’m a wilderness teacher. I have been to the most remote parts of the world and now I can’t trek solo to Everest base camp, which is the most maintained and marked trek in Nepal. It just doesn’t make sense to me why they would do that,” says McDaniels.
But the Everest region might be an exception. The area has not been checking the TIMS permit and has been issuing its own permit. This means solo trekking in the region is still possible, for now.
Mingma Chhiri Sherpa, the chair of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, says solo trekkers are welcome to the region as this decision was not made by the government but by the NTB and TAAN.
“Banning solo tourists will give a negative image of Khumbu and the Everest region. We have been home to such trekkers for a long time and solo trekkers are welcome here anytime,” says Sherpa.
Sherpa feels the decision was made in haste without holding discussions with the stakeholders and questions if there are enough guides to cater to the number of trekkers that come to Nepal each year.
“We still don’t know what the Tourism Ministry has to say about the decision to ban solo trekking,” says Sherpa.
While the majority of trekking guides are happy about the new rule that bans solo trekking, there are a few who feel the rule has been brought in an ad-hoc manner. Independent trekking guides are the most hit by this as they are not allowed to take clients trekking as the new rule states the TIMS permit will be issued only via an authorised trekking agency.
“It’s like the trekking companies want to control everything. This would mean independent guides like me will have to work with a trekking company and give them a cut. This is so unfair,” says Mohan, an independent trekking guide.
Mohan feels this solo trekking ban will saturate the market too as the cost of a trekking guide will surely go down if it becomes mandatory for everyone to have one.
“Will we be able to cater to over 300,000 trekkers? I don’t think so. What is their plan or do they take decisions just for the sake of trekking companies,” he questions.
He feels the number will not go down this season and those hiring guides will go up as many have already booked trips.
“But it will be interesting to see the number of tourists in 2024 and 2025 if this rule is still in place,” says Mohan.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/solo-trekking-ban-future-nepal.html,travel

The board director Maniraj Lamichhane informs this decision will be implemented from April 1.

The ABCs of trekking in Nepal: Here’s a guide for beginners,"Saturday, February 18, 2023","The majestic Himalayas are a dream destination for adventurers and trekkers alike. From the bustling trails of the Annapurna circuit to the snow-capped peaks of the Everest base camp, this guide will help you map out trekking in Nepal, which could be the journey of your dreams.
For centuries, Nepal has been a popular destination for trekkers, who come to hike and explore its vast array of peaks and valleys.
Nepal provides an abundance of trekking options, making it an ideal spot for those seeking thrilling journeys in the realm of adventure tourism.
Before I give you a long list of destinations for trekking in Nepal, it should be noted that the Himalayas are the highest mountain range on earth. Meaning, you will be up for high-altitude trekking no matter where you choose to go trekking in Nepal.
My obvious recommendation would be to do the Everest base camp trek!
It is one of the most sought-after treks in Nepal, offering spectacular mountain views, an experience of the vibrant culture of the Sherpa people who inhabit the region, and the chance to stand at the foot of the world’s highest mountain.
This trek is equally amazing for Nepali and foreigners alike as it provides a sense of accomplishment and a unique sense of achievement for those who take up the challenge. Moreover, the scenic flight to Lukla is a thrilling experience in itself.
Second, on my list of destinations for trekking in Nepal would be the infamous Annapurna region. The region is home to a variety of treks, ranging from easy village treks to more challenging high-altitude passes. You can explore a range of environments, including alpine meadows, dense forests, and icy valleys while on treks such as the traditional Annapurna base camp, the Annapurna circuit, or shorter treks like the Mardi Himal trek or Ghorepani-Poonhill.
Besides these two popular destinations, the Langtang valley trek, Manaslu circuit trek, Upper Mustang and Upper Dolpo trekking are great choices to explore off the beaten routes in the Himalayas.
Whether you love travelling solo, with your partner, friends, family or with a group of strangers, the trails in Nepal are always welcome for you.
What I do suggest is you trek with a trusted travel company or a registered guide as trekking in Nepal’s high altitudes is not something you should take lightly. This will not only put you in safe hands, but you will have an insider into the local culture, bridge language gaps and know more about the people and the place in depth.
While choosing a trek operator, look for the company’s core values in providing quality services to its clients. Check for its travel policies and make a decision only after reviewing genuine client feedback from travellers who have trekked with the company before.
A moderately fit body with strong willpower can easily trek through any destination within the country. As long as you do not have any serious medical conditions that restrict you from physical training, or outdoor activities, you will be able to trek in Nepal.
Nepal is one of the most affordable countries you can visit. You can probably trade one of your luxury beach vacations for trekking in Nepal. For around $1,500, you can book yourself an adventure to the top of the world. That is certainly an amazing bargain. Exploring other parts of Nepal can be even more economical.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/a-guide-to-trekking-in-nepal.html,travel

Is trekking to Everest base camp alone–without a guide or porter–possible?,"Tuesday, February 7, 2023","The Everest base camp trek is no doubt one of the best trekking destinations in the world. It has everything, an adventurous flight to the gateway to Everest, a nice and easy trail and great views of the mountains.
But, do you really need a guide or a porter to do the Everest base camp trek?
The answer lies in what type of experience you want to have. If you have done trekking in Nepal without a guide or a porter, you can do this easily. The trails are well marked and chances of getting lost are almost none. There are a lot of trekkers around the area during peak seasons, so even if you feel like you are lost, you could just ask anyone for directions.
But, this is okay only if you are confident and know you could trek alone in Nepal.
If a more holistic experience is what you are looking for, a trek to the Everest base camp is always better with both a guide and a porter. A guide and a porter do not just make your trek easier, they also offer you what you are never able to experience trekking alone.
They give you short stories about the places you are staying and the many myths around the Everest region. Did you know there is a Yeti skull at a monastery in Khumjung, a short hike from Namche Bazar? These are the types of information that you get if you take a guide along with you.
The Everest base camp trek also has a few hidden gems. Sure, you can go there alone, but unearthing these hidden gems with someone who knows about it will definitely give you a better experience. Apart from that, if you take a guide on your trek to the Everest region, you will also be suggested some really nice lodges to stay at.
Taking a guide and a porter on your trek to the Everest base camp will also help you understand things you want to do from a personal standpoint. You might come across a person who interests you and during that, your guide can act as a translator. Apart from that, the guide can also help you in the lodge you stay at.
A guide also helps you gain a cultural experience apart from everything else. When trekking from one village to another, they show you a glimpse of daily life and explain what exactly the locals are doing and how they sustain themselves.
Sometimes hiking can be quite tedious and boring, so having a chat with the guide during the trek is a nice way to learn more about the region and the country in general.
Hiring a guide and a porter also helps the local economy. These people have decided to stay in Nepal and do something in the country rather than leave for the Gulf or Southeast Asia as migrant workers. If you hire them, you not only get a great experience yourself, but you also help Nepal’s economy.
Trekking with a guide and porter also helps boost one’s morale. Trekking to the Everest base camp is not that easy. There will be times when you lose all hope seeing one uphill after another. But in these times, the smiling faces of Nepali guides and porters can be pretty uplifting. A good guide always keeps your spirits up and distracts you with cultural facts when you are low on morale. They tell jokes and ask you to rest when they feel you need to sit out and point out places, which will amuse you.
Hiring a trekking guide for the Everest base camp costs anywhere between USD 20-30 per day. The rate depends on how experienced the guide is. The cost for a porter is around USD 15-20 per day. There are also options to take a porter guide (one person for two jobs), which costs you around USD 25-30 per day.
The gateway to the Everest base camp starts with a flight to Lukla, known as the world’s most dangerous airport. After that, you start hiking up the Khumbu valley through places like Phakding, Monjo, Namche Bazar, Syagboche, Khumjung, Tengboche, Pangboche, Dingboche, Lobuche and Gorak Shep. During this, you have to acclimate at Namche Bazar and Dingboche regardless of trekking alone or with a guide and a porter.
Yes, you do need a permit to get into the Everest base camp. The cost of a permit is Rs 2,000 per person. It can be bought at either Lukla or the Sagarmatha National Park entry point in Monjo, but not in Kathmandu.
The other permit you need to get is the Sagarmatha National Park permit. Everyone going on the Everest base camp trek needs to buy this permit. The cost of the permit is Rs 3,000 per person with an additional 13 per cent levied on it.
You can get the Sagarmatha National Park Entry permits at Monjo at the entry gate or at the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) counter at Bhrikutimandap in Kathmandu.
These permits can only be bought with Nepali currency only.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-base-camp-no-guide-porter.html,travel

Bhairahawa airport shut for over a month citing bad weather,"Tuesday, January 24, 2023","Butwal, January 24
Nepal’s second international airport, Gautam Buddha International Airport, popularly known as the Bhairahawa airport, has not operated any international flights since December 21, 2022.
The Bhairahawa airport began its operation in May 2022 whereas regular flights began in June only. With the airport halting its regular services after six months, stakeholders are worried that if the airport could be sustainable.
Citing low visibility caused by fog, no airline company has operated any flight from and to the airport in the past month.
Jazeera Airways, the first company to operate regular flights there, has stopped its operation since December 21. Likewise, Himalaya Airlines which began flights there just a few weeks ago is not flying since December 16.
The national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation, has not operated any international flight from the airport despite announcing a schedule for the current season.
The airport spokesperson Subhash Jha says Jazeera Airways has informed it will resume flights on February 2.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bhairahawa-airport-shut-bad-weather.html,travel
Domestic airports in Nepal prove white elephants as politicians disregard prudent planning,"Monday, January 23, 2023","On January 8, a Tara Air aircraft landed at Resunga Airport in Gulmi. The excitement in Resunga municipality was such that the city welcomed the flight halting all services. It was clear the residents of Gulmi were excited. But, fear also crept in as they were not sure if the airline would regularly fly to Resunga, one among the many domestic airports in Nepal that exist on the list but do not function actively.
One person who fears for the future of the airport is the CPN-Unified Socialist leader Ram Kumari Jhakri.
“To ensure the airport has regular flights, we need aircraft, but our country doesn’t have enough of them,” says Jhakri.
Her reservations are justified too as many domestic airports in Nepal have opened with the same vigour, but after a few years of operations, they have become a white elephant.
In February 2022, a test flight was conducted at Phalgunanda Airport in Ilam. There was excitement on the faces of the locals who felt they no longer needed to travel to Bhadrapur in Jhapa to fly away. But after a few months, the flights got halted citing a lack of adequate passengers, and it has recently restarted after the local government’s agreement to pay for vacant seats.
Ilam is also the home district of Ubaraj Adhikari, the current executive chairman of Nepal Airlines Corporation. Moreover, the airport project went ahead with the force of former prime minister Jhala Nath Khanal.
Adhikari has the responsibility and authority to provide regular services to domestic airports not only in Ilam but all over the country. But, many new airports in the country have not even had test flights let alone commercial flights.
Balewa Airport in Baglung was blacktopped in 2017 and saw a few flights. But, the airport has not seen a single flight for quite some time. Manang’s Humde Airport is also blacktopped, but the people of Manang rarely see flights.
The former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, says the operational status of any airport project should be looked at from a long-term perspective.
“The issue of whether or not the airport is sustainable is directly connected with whether there are passengers willing to fly there. We’ve failed to assess that and continued building domestic airports in Nepal without thinking about how to attract passengers,” says Suman.
According to him, unless passengers and airline companies are attracted to the airport, the project will fail and the airport will not be sustainable.
Suman says that the only way airports in remote areas will be sustainable is by enhancing the purchasing power of the people, which will lead to airline companies making a profit on flights to these areas, which is not happening right now.
“We’ve seen how other domestic airports in Nepal such as those in Bhadrapur, Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Simara and Bhatarpur shut down in the past. But, now, they are back in operation. Why? Because there was demand,” says Suman.
Currently, Nepal has 53 airports, but only 33 are in regular operation. Out of the 33, only 10 are sustainable.
“An environment that attracts passengers and airlines should be created. When we do that, the remaining airports will also come into operation and become sustainable,” says Suman.
One challenge domestic airports in Nepal face is road expansion. Some airports that were doing well are in a state of extinction as people prefer to travel to these destinations by road. Tikapur Airport, Jiri Airport and Humde Airport in Manang are such examples.
Meghauli Airport’s demise was due to Bharatpur Airport getting a facelift, after which larger aircraft started to fly there. Baglung’s Balewa Airport was affected by Pokhara Airport, which is only three hour’s drive away. Now with Pokhara getting an international airport and the highway from Pokhara to Baglung getting better, it is unlikely that the Balewa Airport will operate again. Jiri Aiport in Dailekh is also unlikely to operate due to the Lukla airport being a better option to go to Everest.
Manang’s Humde Airport is another example of the domestic airports in Nepal that have failed to attract flights. Due to the lack of hotel infrastructure, low population and lack of tourism promotion, the airport has not seen a flight in years despite it seeing thousands of trekkers every year.
When Pradeep Kumar Gyawali was the civil aviation minister in 2006, he laid the foundation stones for Gulmi Airport in his home district. Back then, no one cared about the commercial feasibility of the airport.
“The state should not always think about profit and loss,” Gyawali wrote on social media. “When it comes to building roads in remote areas, the government doesn’t think about profit and loss, do they?”
But when many domestic airports in Nepal are not making enough to manage their operating cost, how practical is it to build new ones knowing they will not be able to host flights in the long run?
Experts say these airports benefit no one but a few politicians who build them to fulfil promises made prior to elections.
A Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) official agrees as he says most projects in Nepal are built out of political pressure without thinking about their commercial success.
“If the project goes ahead under political pressure, they only see if the aircraft can take off and land. They don’t see if it is commercially viable or not,” says the official.
Former tourism minister Prem Ale laid the foundation stone of Majgaun Airport in Mahendranagar. But, this is quite impractical as Dhangadhi already has a functioning airport close to the proposed Majgaun Airport.
The previous government had allocated a budget to conduct a feasibility study for an airport in Dadeldhura, the home district of former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
An environmental impact assessment is also being done for an airport near former prime minister KP Sharma Oli’s ancestors’ home in Chuhandanda in Tehrathum.
The UML government made a huge effort to build a domestic airport in Kavre. UML leader Gokul Baskota was the one pushing for the airport there. However, there has not been a reliable study on whether or not there is a possibility of operating the airport commercially.
There are many reasons why domestic airports in Nepal have failed commercially. One is the lack of small aircraft that can fly to these airports that have small runways. Another is these small aircraft cannot carry enough passengers, which could make the airport sustainable.
Currently, Nepali airline companies are in a race to purchase as many big aircraft as possible as a larger aircraft means cheaper operating costs for the airline company. This means that even though there is a demand to fly to smaller airports, the lack of small aircraft means the companies have not been able to meet the demands.
The NAC, which flew to some domestic airports in Nepal’s rural area has cut down flights drastically as it only has two small aircraft, which fly to eastern and western Nepal airports once a week.
However, if there are any interruptions, the service will be interrupted for several days. When it comes to the private sector, only the aircraft of Tara, Summit and Sita Air fly to small domestic airports in Nepal’s remote areas.
These companies also do not have enough aircraft and they mostly push to fly to destinations like Lukla and Simikot where they can charge foreigners a lot of money.
A Twin Otter aircraft, currently owned by NAC, is over 40 years old. With the aim of displacing these planes and creating an impressive presence in Nepal’s domestic flights, the corporation advanced the process of purchasing small aircraft in 2011.
Accordingly, on April 27, 2014, the first MA 60 ship landed in Kathmandu. Out of the total of six aircraft, the last two Chinese aircraft landed in Kathmandu on February 13, 2018. However, these aircraft have not flown for over two years.
The corporation says that it could not fly these planes and asked the government to find an alternative. However, the government did not take ownership of it.
As a result, the two aircraft have become white elephants. On the other hand, the corporation’s flights to domestic airports in Nepal have become dependent on the 40-year-old aircraft.
On the other hand, private airlines are in profit and could fly to small domestic airports. But, the government of Nepal and CAAN do not offer these companies an attractive incentive package to attract them to these airports.
According to CAAN Director General Pradeep Adhikari, with the aim of providing financial relief to the companies flying to domestic airports in Nepal’s remote areas, the overtime operating fee charged at such airports has been abolished.
He also says a Remote Area Air Fund is being proposed to cover the operating losses incurred by airline companies.

Pokhara plane crash defers Nepal’s hope of getting off EU air safety blacklist,"Sunday, January 22, 2023","Kathmandu, January 22
The Pokhara plane crash killing almost all on board on January 15 has deferred Nepal’s hopes of getting out of the European Union air safety blacklist.
The accident took place while the European Commission was preparing to send a team for the on-site assessment of Nepal’s aviation situation, which ultimately forced the commission to withdraw from the plan now.
In a joint statement on Friday, EU Ambassador to Nepal Nona Deprez and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) Director General Pradeep Adhikari said, “In mutual agreement, the EU and CAAN have reached a conclusion that it would be in our best mutual interest to postpone a planned on-site assessment visit mandated by the EU Air Safety Committee, for the time being. The primary focus for CAAN, at this time, is on dealing with the aftermath of the accident.”
The statement does not specify when the next round of assessment will take place.
The European Commission’s decision to blacklist the country on its air safety list has barred aircraft belonging to Nepali airline companies from European skies since 2013.

Pokhara plane crash could hit Nepal’s tourism industry hard,"Monday, January 16, 2023","After the inauguration of Pokhara Regional International Airport, locals stopped seeing aircraft flying above Prithvi Chok in the country’s tourism capital. But on Sunday, the scenes were different as a Yeti Airlines aircraft not only flew above the area but crashed in a gorge near a densely populated area of the city.
Babar Jung Gurung was on his terrace when he saw an uncontrolled aircraft turn to one side. By the time he could think what was going wrong, he heard an explosion.
“I rushed to the site and there was fire and smoke everywhere,” he said. “The aircraft had broken in half. It was chaotic. I had never seen anything like it.”
According to another local Bikas Basyal, the aircraft crashed into the top of the gorge, after which the loud noise came.
“Bodies were flying everywhere along with the parts of the aircraft. It was like a scene from a movie,” says Basyal.
As soon as that happened, there was smoke everywhere. The aircraft was burning in such a manner that the sky was full of smoke and news of the crash spread like wildfire.
Following that, the incident site was chaotic. People from all over Pokhara were there to see what had happened. Some helped the local security forces in the rescue process, but many were there just to see what was going on as they stood there taking videos obstructing the rescue.
So far, only 68 out of the 72 bodies have been found. Out of those only 26 have been identified.
While people outside the city will gradually forget the Pokhara plane crash, stakeholders here are concerned about the impact the incident could have on the city’s, as well as the country’s, prosperous tourism industry. Many fear that these crashes will be detrimental to the industry, which is gradually getting back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic.
When the airport was inaugurated on January 1, many had seen it positively and had hoped it would be the stepping stone to the country being economically stable. The people of Pokhara were even more ecstatic as their decades-old dream of having an international airport had finally come true.
Even Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was hopeful as the had mentioned during the inauguration ceremony how Pokhara Regional International Airport would contribute greatly to the country’s economy.
All that excitement turned into despair in little over two weeks as the city that was celebrating the airport went into mourning.
“The whole country is in mourning. This is a dark day for Nepal’s aviation and tourism industries,” says Sanjay Adhikari, a Pokhara local.
Oddly, the aircraft that crashed on Sunday was the same one that flew the first commercial flight to the new airport. Even the pilot was the same. On day 1, he stated how the new airport was safe and how he was excited to fly there. Sadly, his excitement was shortlived as the crash is the worst domestic air disaster the country has ever seen.
This crash, the second in less than a year involving a Yeti Group aircraft, highlights the country’s poor air safety record. On May 29, 2022, a Tara Air aircraft crashed en route to Jomson killing all 22 on board.
Nepal’s air safety record is already infamous. The EU has put a ban on Nepali airline companies to fly to Europe citing safety concerns. The world knows this and if crashes like these continue, no foreigner or even a Nepali would like to fly a domestic aircraft.
“This accident is very sad for us when there is a challenge to operate regular air services at the new international airport here,” said industrialist Ananda Ram Mulmi. “Is it human error or are our aircraft too old? We need to conduct proper research.”
Basu Tripathi, a tourism entrepreneur, says that the accident raises questions about the future of Pokhara Regional International Airport.
“How did the crash happen? The weather was clear. The aircraft was connected with the ATC too. Do we assume something was wrong with the aircraft then?” he questions.
Tripathi says like all other crashes, the government and authorised bodies will forget about the crash in a few days. He feels that the people just do not learn and as result, the country has seen crashes like this regularly now. According to data, Nepal has seen 104 crashes since 1955, in which over 800 people have died. If you look at the last 24 years, Yeti Airlines has been involved in 13 crashes.
In May 2012, 19 people died when an Agni Air aircraft crashed near the Jomsom airport. In August 2002, 18 people lost their lives when a Twin-Otter plane of Shangrila Air crashed in Pokhara.

Ilam-Kathmandu direct flight resumes after 5 months,"Sunday, January 15, 2023","Ilam, January 15
The Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has resumed Ilam-Kathmandu direct flights.
Direct flights on this route began on February 20, 2022, with a Tara Air aircraft conducting a flight every week. However, it got halted in August 2022 after the local municipality withdrew from its contract to pay the company for the vacant seats when there are not sufficient passengers.
Airline companies say the tickets that they sell for the route do not cover the operation of the aircraft, hence the government should compensate.
Accordingly, the NAC and the municipality agreed to make a flight every week. Following the agreement, an NAC aircraft made a flight to Phalgunanda Sukilumba Airport from Kathmandu this morning.
“With the resumption of flights, we hope for better touristic activities here,” Mayor Kedar Thapa says.
The NAC will run a 19-seater Twin Otter and the one-way plane airfare from Ilam to Kathmandu is fixed at Rs 6,300 while the fare is 6,500 for the reverse route.

Ghumante: Who is behind Nepal’s popular travel vlogs?,"Thursday, January 12, 2023","“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”
Shakespeare’s superfamous line from his masterpiece, Romeo and Juliet, undermines the importance of a name given to anyone, but for Ghumante, the name is everything.
The word means a traveller in Nepal, and this very definition has been an identity for Kanchan Rai and some of his friends. They have a loose network of travellers who create travel vlogs and post on YouTube and social media under the name of Ghumante. For the viewers, Ghumante is a person more than a group.
Sometimes Ghumante climbs the snow-covered peaks; other times, it wanders wildly on the plains of the Terai. Sometimes it relaxes on the bases and other times travels through the hills. A busy traveller, through and through…
Where is Ghumante? From Churiyamai to Nar Phu Valley, from Darchula to Taplejung, Ghumante has been everywhere. And, it is pointless to ask “where have you reached so far” because the list of places Ghumante has not reached is shorter.
“I just arrived in Kathmandu from Kaski yesterday. It is my job to travel, so wherever I can go, I end up travelling,” says Rai, the founder of the Ghumante team.
Rai, a native of Khotang, says travelling is his life.
Rai was living abroad and working for an IT company, but his desire to explore Nepal made him the Ghumante. Thus, he along with his team created travel vlogs.
Whenever he sees photos of the glimmering snow-capped mountains or the calm water casting the shadows of clouds, be it the photos of colourful flowers blooming or the plains that stretched to infinity, he felt like he was missing a lot of things and the opportunity to travel.
“My sisters and friends used to come back from travelling, and I used to get restless seeing them; thinking how people are travelling and I am here in one place.”
But to travel, one needs money and equipment. “Who will give me the money just so that I want to travel?”
However, now, he realises money is not the first requirement, it is one’s willpower, determination, and confidence. And, these three qualities made Ghumante and took Rai to all the corners of the country familiarising him with the soil of his country and its vibrancy.
Travelling brought him–and other members of the Ghumante team–not only work and money but name and fame also. “When they see me, they ask for a photo, shake hands, and make acquaintances.”
But, how, when, and where did Ghumante start travelling?
“After I left my job in IT, I started working as a freelancer and had enough time and some money,” Rai says, “So I started exploring hills around Kathmandu with friends.”
Soon after, Rai reached Kalinchok in Dolakha, then Helambu and Mustang. He says travelling makes people addicted. Travelling was also an escape from the confinement of the house. So, he would gather friends and go on the trip.
“I don’t like to travel alone at all. I need a friend,” he says, “A team of four or five people with different tastes would wander having fun and making jokes along the journey.”
With time, he learned the art of travelling and his circle of friends also increased.
After they formed the travelling group, Ghumante, they decided to start their journey to the Everest base camp. Everything needed to reach there was prepared, but then, at the last moment, they wanted to change the destination to Panch Pokhari or Sabhapokhari because the EBC was crowded.
“I was in Bangkok at that time and we were talking about the trip online. They were all my online friends. Only after I came back to Nepal, I met them.”
Then, this group of travellers chose Sabhapokhari as their new destination.
However, it was not easy to travel to the destination and their preparation was not enough. So, the team went to Gupha Pokhari, a peaceful destination, full of solitude. From there, they wanted to take fascinating pictures and videos of the Milky Way band. “Our plan to take photos of the Milky Way did not pan out as we imagined, but we were able to experience the first trip of the Ghumante team.”
Their second destination was Dolpa, more precisely the Shey Phoksundo lake. This trip encouraged them to travel more, this time to the Api Himal base camp. “We chose the destination as it was not crowded and less explored. So, we started exploring such new places,” says Rai.
“Happiness is not in the destination but in the journey” has become an important lesson for the Ghumante team today. After embarking on a journey, every step is like a surprise. “You don’t know what you’ll see, what you’ll find or experience,” he says, “Such curiosity keeps the mind occupied. Seeing things you have never seen before and talking to people you have never talked to, your heart melts.”
Different people have different appearances and different ways of living. The joy of travelling on foot is that one can get to interact with others wondering about ‘what kind of people will be there?’, ‘how do they speak?’, ‘how do they make a living?’, and ‘how do they enjoy life?’.
But, travelling is not always fun; it can also be frustrating—not knowing what is ahead or where to live or what can you eat. “You have to take a lot of pain and risk. Sometimes you get to a terrible place. Sometimes it is uncertain whether you will live or die,” he says, “Other times, you will reach a charming place. And sometimes it will be like playing an adventure game.”
Kanchan Rai’s heart still beats fast when he remembers a trip to the far west. They had to walk a trail, which was so narrow that only one foot could be placed and they had to grab the grasses tightly for the movement. On such a trail, they walked for hours. If they got off balance even by little, they would fall before they reached their destination.
“I had walked many such ways before, but it would be for some 10 to 15 minutes at a time. But here, my muscle got a cramp, but I had to walk anyway, ” Rai says, “We completed the journey at the risk of our lives: from Kalikot to Badimalika. I thought that trip was the riskiest in my life.”
“But the recent trip to Bajhang surpassed even that. The trip was so scary that while editing the video, my heart kept pounding,” recalling the trip, he adds, “After staying there for one night, we returned.”
Floods and landslides devastated the area; even the walking path was washed away. So all that was left was a space to step one foot at a time until you reached a village. The village was on a slope. So, if it rained at night, it could wash away the house they were staying in.
Travelling across the country, Ghumante has gathered many such experiences that rarely happen in a person’s life. But, Rai says the most important thing is to be able to introduce the country to the world through their vlogs.

How Nepal’s new Pokhara airport might fall prey to India-China tussle,"Tuesday, January 10, 2023","Buddha Air wants to commence its Varanasi flights from the newly inaugurated Pokhara Regional International Airport. The airline company, on November 14, 2022, stated its intentions to start three flights a week from Pokhara to Varanasi and said it also wanted to start flights from Pokhara to Delhi and Dehradun in the future.
Their plan, however, took a massive hit when a Buddha Air plane to fly a chartered aircraft to Varanasi from the new Pokhara airport on January 1 did not receive permission to fly to India.
Was this an intentional ploy from India or just a technical issue? The answer is anyone’s guess.
Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal say they will get an answer if Budhha Air manages to get permission from India to fly regularly to Varanasi from Pokhara in the future.
“We can’t assume things just yet. We need to wait and see what happens because I don’t see any reason for India not to allow Buddha Air to fly to Varanasi from Pokhara as they have been doing so regularly from Kathmandu,” says a CAAN official.
But, no one knows if India looks at the Pokhara airport only from a technical point of view or from a strategic and tactical point of view. The answer will be given within some time. However, the officials of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation are doubtful if the issue of flying to Indian cities from the Pokhara airport will be resolved through a simple and regular process.
The ministry officials suspect India might purposely try to derail the project and prevent the Pokhara airport from becoming commercially successful.
Why? Because Pokhara Airport was built with the help of loans provided by China, which also claims it is a part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative. Everybody knows India’s relationship with China has not been the best recently.
For the Pokhara airport to be successful, Nepal has to target Indian and Chinese tourists and establish direct flights to major cities of the two countries. The airport has been built with an expensive loan from China, so it is imperative that Nepal target the two countries if it wants the airport to be a commercial success.
But, becoming a commercial success is a distant dream as the airport needs to make around Rs 2.5 billion just to pay the interest on the loans.
It is highly likely China will fly aircraft to Pokhara, but if India will is a greater question that needs to be answered.
People are sceptical because India has not allowed Himalaya Airlines, an airline company owned by the Yeti Group and Chinese investors, to fly to India.
Another reason why experts are unsure if India will fly its aircraft to the Pokhara airport is a lack of an easy, accessible and convenient route. Experts believe the Pokhara airport will suffer the same fate as Bhairahawa’s Gautam Buddha International Airport as foreign airline companies have been refusing to fly there mentioning the difficult air route.
The Government of India has not agreed to allow aircraft to enter Nepal through Bhairahwa, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar routes. This has caused a massive blow to both Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports. Many argue the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation and the government authorities have not put much effort into it.
Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, a joint secretary of the ministry, says talks are ongoing about necessary initiatives and coordination is being taken with the Indian government regarding new air routes and entry points.
“We’ve done what we needed to do. We are hopeful the Indian government will be open to allowing aircraft to enter Nepal from the west,” says Lamichhane.
Currently, India allows aircraft to exit Nepal through Mahendranagar, Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Janakpur. But, India only allows one air route to enter Nepal: Simara. Nepal is lobbying to ensure India allows both entry and exit through the cities mentioned above.
The talk has been going on for years, but India is yet to come to agree to the terms. This has caused major issues as no international airline is flying to Gautam Buddha International Airport resulting in a major loss for the government.
The head of Gautam Buddha International Airport, Govinda Dahal, says that routes with air entry points from western Nepal are necessary and added international airline companies would be attracted to fly to this airport if Nepal gets permission.
According to Lamichhane from the ministry, 60-70 per cent of the international flights in Nepal want to use the western route to enter Nepal. But, as India has not given permission, all of them enter Nepal via Simara in southern Nepal.
The planes coming from Bhutan enter Nepal via Jhapa in the east and the planes coming from Lhasa enter Nepal via the Nunim Point (Bravo 345).
According to CAAN, the western route (Gulf 589) is used by airlines coming from Gulf countries, Turkey and New Delhi in India. The east route (Romeo 581) is used for flights coming from Kolkata in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, etc.
But, since India has not given permission to fly into Nepal from either of the routes, aircraft coming to Nepal have to come via Simara, which is a hassle for many. If India gives permission to enter Nepal via the western route, nearly 70 per cent of flights will not have to enter Nepal via Simara.
India is reluctant to do this as it has been charging navigation fees from aircraft for using its air space for a longer duration.
If India does open the western and eastern air routes, Nepal would also be able to charge navigation fees and earn a good amount. This would also decrease the cost for international airlines, which would mean cheaper tickets.
According to experts, the longer the flight, the higher the air safety risk. India knows this, yet it is hesitating to give permission to open the two routes.
Despite being aware that the air route has disrupted the operation of the Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports, the government of Nepal has not taken a high-level diplomatic initiative. Since the idea of the two airports surfaced, it was clear India would not give Nepal the air routes it needed. But, Nepal has been arguing that it is the country’s right to get the air route.
A meeting was held in Kolkata to discuss this in 2016, but it bore no fruit. The officials from both sides were going to meet in October 2017, but the Nepali team could not go to India due to the risk of violating the election code of conduct. Then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, during his visit to India, met his counterpart Narendra Modi and spoke about this issue.
Soon after that, CAAN and the Airports Authority of India met and discussed that a detailed technical study could be carried out regarding making the Kathmandu-Biratnagar and Kathmandu-Janakpur routes two-way for international flights and giving an entry route from Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar in the west for international flights.
Accordingly, when the Nepali team reached Delhi to finalise the flight safety assessment, the Airport Authority of India suddenly withdrew from the agreement.
According to Nepali officials, Indian counterparts have been citing the army’s reluctance as it has an army base on the routes Nepal wants permission for. But, these answers are a reason Nepali officials are not positive about getting the air routes opened.
India has also blocked permission to use the ILS, a system that allows flights to land even in low visibility installed by Nepal at Bhairahawa airport. Former secretary and aviation official Yagya Prasad Gautam says that India should show goodwill and give an entry point from western Nepal.
“Nepal needs to come up with a plan to solve this issue,” says Gautam.
Many argue that India, which has not made things easy to operate the Bhairahawa airport, will definitely change its mind and smoothen things for the Pokhara airport as the latter has been stated as a BRI initiative.
It is clear that India has not treated China-related projects well in the past. Over the past few years, India has vocally stated it would not buy electricity generated from Chinese projects.
Meanwhile, China’s claim that the Pokhara airport is a BRI initiative is not entirely true.
The One Belt-One Road (OBOR) launched by China in 2013 was later called the BRI project. China has called BRI a project to help in the development and prosperity of neighbouring and friendly countries. However, due to cold relations with China, India has not joined the BRI project yet.
Nepal became a part of the BRI in 2017 with an agreement signed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. But, the foundation of the Pokhara airport was laid in 2016, a year before Nepal joined the BRI.
As of now, there has not been any project that has been constructed under the BRI initiative as Nepal has not officially signed any agreement that falls under it. To put it bluntly, Nepal is not aware of what projects are BRI and what are not.
However, the officials of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu have repeatedly described the Pokhara airport as a project within the BRI.
On the same day as the airport was inaugurated, the charge d’affaires at Kathmandu’s Chinese embassy, Wang Xin formally recalled the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Nepal and also recalled the announcement of the creation of an aerial network to connect the Himalayas to the world.
He said that a profitable project had been launched to turn the BRI’s vision into reality and tried to interpret the Pokhara airport as a link to it.
On April 21, 2022, then-Chinese Ambassador Hou Yanqi also explained in a press conference that the project advanced by the Chinese side in Nepal was under the BRI project.
However, experts in foreign affairs feel China is overstepping. Former Foreign Minister and UML leader Pradeep Gyawali says China is wrong to claim the Pokhara airport to be a BRI project.
“We signed the BRI in 2017. When President Bidya Devi Bhandari went to the BRI conference in 2019, we defined the BRI as a Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which includes railways, highways, optical fibre, and ports,” Gyawali says, adding he does not understand why the charge d’affaires could claim the Pokhara airport as a BRI project.
He says the airport was not on the list of nine projects selected by Nepal to fall under the BRI.
“Maybe it’s what power countries do. The US also wants to list all its projects in Nepal under the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS). I think the US has a major role in the MCC project being disputed in Nepal,” he says.
Experts in foreign affairs say that it is the government’s responsibility to clarify that such projects made with foreign aid based on the needs of Nepal do not jeopardise the interests of other countries.
Former Nepali ambassador to China, Tanka Karki, says that it is normal to request foreign countries to help fulfil national needs.
“But, the countries cannot interfere in the country’s national interest,” says Karki. “We should stop taking decisions thinking we’ll anger India or China when taking help either of them. That’s not how diplomacy works.”
Former ambassador Karki says the country should be able to reject assertions such as the Pokhara airport being a part of the BRI while remaining committed to its declared policy.
“We should take maximum benefits from our neighbours, and we should promise not to use the land to the detriment of each other,” he says. “We should also seek cooperation from other countries by maintaining friendly relations, believing that such cooperation won’t be used to the detriment of neighbouring countries.”

Alex Txikon and Nepali climbers make first winter ascent of Manalsu in 25 years,"Friday, January 6, 2023","Kathmandu, January 6
Spanish climber Alex Txikon along with six Nepali climbers summited Manaslu on Friday morning.
This is only the third successful winter ascent of the mountain.
Thaneshwar Guragai from Seven Summit Treks confirms the team led by Tixikon reached the true summit of the eighth-highest mountain in the world on Friday morning. With this, Txikon successfully climbed 11 out of 14 eight-thousander mountains.
Tixikon was accompanied by Tenjen Sherpa (Lama), Pasang Nurbu Sherpa,  Mingtemba Sherpa, Chhepal Sherpa, Pemba Tasi Sherpa and Gyalu Sherpa.
This was Tixikon’s third winter attempt on Manaslu. He was joined by Italian alpinist Simone Moro, who abandoned his climb due to an upset stomach.
With this, they become only the third team to reach the summit of Manalsu in winter. The Polish duo of Maciej Berbeka and Ryszard Gajewski first climbed the mountain on January 12, 1984. The last team to climb Manaslu in the winter was back in 1998 when Young-Seok Park along with Kami Dorchi Sherpa and Ang Dawa Tamang reached the summit.
Since then, there have been a few attempts, but due to high winds, bad weather and heavy snow, no one has been able to summit in the winter.
“The successful ascent of Mt Manaslu is a testament to the skill, determination, and strength of the Sherpas and climbers who were part of the team,” says Guragain.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/txikon-nepali-climber-winter-manalsu.html,travel
Mandredhunga is sole paragliding zone in Pokhara as new airport shuts 3 others,"Tuesday, January 3, 2023","Kathmandu, January 3
Madredhunga will be the sole paragliding zone in Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, from now onwards as authorities have shut down three other zones citing the operation of the newly inaugurated Pokhara Regional International Airport.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal says it decided to shut existing paragliding zones in Sarangkot, Torepani and Tamgi areas of the city.
It means the paragliding service will be halted in Pokhara for some time, informs Krishna Bhandari, the immediate past president of the Nepal Airsports Association (NAA), because the operators do not have sufficient preparations in Mandredhunga as they were more focused on Sarankot and Torepani until now.
Meanwhile, the authority says paragliding can be operated in the Mandredhunga area between 11 am and 3 pm only every day. The authority has told the association that it will review the decision and make necessary changes after a month.
Paragliding has become one of the most popular activities among domestic and foreign tourists visiting the country’s tourism capital. However, its safety has been questioned repeatedly as paraglider falls, and subsequent deaths, are reported almost every year.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mandredhunga-pokhara-paragliding-zone.html,travel

6 best birdwatching paradises in Nepal,"Friday, December 23, 2022","Winter is well and truly here, and along with it are the migratory birds that travel thousands of miles to get to Nepal. According to experts, over 100 species of birds come to Nepal every year from places like Russia and Siberia and spend a few months in mostly the Terai region of Nepal.
Birds like mallard, ruddy shelduck, gadwall, Eurasian teal, greenshank, thrush, flycatcher and booted eagle are among few that can be seen in forests around the country. Apart from that, there are plenty of local birds in Nepal that makes the country a treat to all birdwatchers with a lot of places ideal for birdwatching.
But, where exactly in Nepal does one go for birdwatching to get a glimpse of these creatures? Worry not; we bring a list of places you can visit to observe these birds from halfway across the world.
The capital city is home to around 500 species of birds that can be seen in areas like Shivapuri, Nargarjun, Pulchoki and Raniban. Areas around Chobhar, Taudaha, Nagdaha and Manohara are also the desired areas for birdwatching as there are birds like raptors, mallard, gadwall, northern shoveler, northern pintail, ferruginous pochard, common pochard, ruddy shell duck and great cormorant. It is not just in the winters that the valley sees foreign birds because the Eurasian cuckoo, Asian koel, white-breasted water hen, common moorhen and greater painted snipe can be seen in the summer as the valley’s weather and its water bodies give the perfect refuge.
Chitwan is probably the best area for birdwatching in the winter. The dense jungle of the Chitwan National Park is home to so many different birds. According to data, it is home to more than 543 species of birds, which is the largest number of birds compared to other national parks of Nepal. While many people come to Nepal for the mountains, there are few who come here for birds like black-chinned yuhina, Gould’s sunbird, blossom-headed parakeet, Bengal florican, lesser adjutant and grey-crowned prinia. The park is also home to the great oriental darter and the honey buzzard.
Apart from these, chirping birds like hornbills, babblers, bitterns and kingfishers add some charm to the national park.
Additionally, small chirping birds like slender-billed babblers, bitterns, kingfishers many other birds make it a perfect birdwatching destination.
This is another paradise for birdwatching where people can see a variety of both resident and migratory birds. As it has plenty of wetlands, this is a haven for both birds and birdwatchers. The wildlife reserve is home to watercock, Indian nightjar, dusky eagle owl, black-headed cuckoo shrike, white-tailed stonechat, striated grassbird, large adjutant stork, Pallas’s fish eagle, common golden-eye, gull-billed tern, swamp francolin, rufous-vented grass babbler, and Bengal floricans. As some of these birds are endangered, researchers and bird lovers often visit this part of Nepal.
Shuklaphanta National Park in far-west Nepal is also another area that should be on the birdwatching destination list of bird lovers. Home to over 400 species, people can expect to see birds like the swamp francolin, Jerdon’s bush chat, rufous-rumped grassbird, chestnut-capped babbler and Jerdon’s babbler. Dusky eagle owl, rufous-bellied eagle, and an oriental pied hornbill are also quite popular in the area.
It is another national park that is full of different bird species. Known mostly for tigers, Bardiya is also home to over 500 species of birds including endangered species like lesser florican, Bengal florican, silver eared mesia, sarus crane, white-rumped vulture, jungle prinia, golden-headed cisticola, and many more. These birds are mostly seen along the banks of the Karnali river, Babai river, Badhaiya lake and Satkhalauwa lake.
Apart from Nepal’s plains and hills, the mountains are also home to different bird species, hence ideal for birdwatching. Nepal’s national bird, the Lophophorus, is predominantly found there. Researchers also say that Jerdon’s baza, a bird that is extinct, is also found in the Himalayas. Apart from these, Himalayan raven, blood pheasant, koklass pheasant, Himalayan monal, kalij pheasant and the globally near-threatened satyr tragopan are also found in the mountainous areas like the Annapurnas. White-rumped vulture, the golden eagle, and the crested serpent eagle are also some notable birds one can see in these areas.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/birdwatching-nepal.html,travel

Jiri’s once glorious identity as gateway to Everest is now losing its grace,"Wednesday, December 21, 2022","The city of Jiri, which used to be known as the gateway to Everest, where its hotel rooms would be packed during the trekking season, is deserted these days. The city seems to have an identity crisis and is struggling to sustain itself.
The place, until a decade ago, would be full of foreigners. The streets of Jiri market would be buzzing. But now, everything is a distant memory.
“Sometimes we sit and talk about the old days. Things were so different to what it is now. This place has become sort of a ghost town now,” says Tanka Jirel, former mayor of Jiri municipality.
However, with the change in time and easy access from Kathmandu to Solukhumbu, foreigners who visit Nepal to climb or trek to Everest directly fly to Lukla airport. This means the city which once was the gateway to Everest is just another city in its shadow. In addition, the decline in foreign tourists in the city has also impacted its economic sustainability.
In Tony Hegan’s book, Nepal, he described Jiri as Nepal’s Switzerland. The city used to have Swiss-style chalets, most of which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. Lila Ram Khadka, a local working in the tourism sector, says, tourists are often disappointed to see what Jiri has become.
“They read about Jiri and come expecting something like Switzerland. But when they get here, they are disappointed as the city falls short of their expectations,” says Khadka.
Along with Jirel and Khadka, Jiri’s residents still have vibrant memories from the past about the lively city and can ponder about the past for hours. But, everyone knows that whatever they do, the glory days are not coming back.
Jiri has slowed down now. Keshav Jirel, a local hotel owner, says around nine packed busses full of tourists would arrive at Jiri every day during the trekking season.
“Now only two busses come here and most of the time it’s empty,” says Keshav.
Jiri has now become an example of how a city’s identity can get lost over time. The city is developed in terms of infrastructure. However, the central hilly city is still in crisis.
There is a hospital building with facilities but without any specialist doctors. Even the mayor finds it hard to find doctors who want to stay there. The city also has a library, but it does not have new books. There is also an airport, but no aircraft lands there.
“Different Swiss organisations built physical infrastructures and provided employment for some time,” says a former member of the parliament, Indra Bahadur Khadka, “But, they did not teach self-reliance, and as a result, Jiri could not sustain the project once it started.”
Now, the people here are facing issues such as unemployment, lack of environment for higher education and more. However, Jiri, burdened by its proud history, is now attempting to find its own path. Mitra Bahadur Jirel, the mayor of Jiri municipality, says, “We have put forward a plan to rebrand Jiri with a new identity.”
Jiri’s infrastructure development odyssey began in 1957 when the livestock development programme was launched with financial and technical assistance from the Swiss government during the Panchayat rule.
Former MP Khadka says, “Murrah buffaloes, Brown Swiss, and Holstein cows were introduced. Then, there was the remodelling of the government-built cowshed, meadows, and the breeding of advanced breeds of cows and buffaloes.”
After this event, the number of Swiss people in Jiri increased. The Swiss built a hospital in Jiri and ran a cheese industry. Jiri gradually turned into a technical school. All these projects that were started by the Swiss are still running.
“The only thing that the Swiss have started and we failed to run is the airport,” says Mitra Bahadur Jirel, the mayor of Jiri municipality.
With the Swiss project in Jiri, many locals got employment opportunities. Moreover, people from other districts too migrated to Jiri in search of jobs.
While various Swiss projects were in full swing, they also built small attractive houses designed in the Swiss style. Moreover, they built a cow farm and gradually started a hospital in a tent. Tek Bahadur Jirel, the former principal of Jiri Secondary School, says, “Doctors, nurses and staff in that hospital were all Swiss.”
As the number of foreigners increased in Jiri, the business of the city also increased. Former mayor Tanka Jirel says, “More businesspeople from Kathmandu, Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Solukhumbu came here and settled down.”
Talking about the influence of Swiss people in Jiri, former mayor Jirel explains that a person named Shiva Bahadur Karki suffering from tuberculosis came to Jiri’s hospital. After fully recovering, he settled in Jiri and opened a small eatery.
“Until then, Jiri Bazaar had not been established and there wasn’t any place to gather for the Swiss expatriates. Karki served tea and breakfast in his eatery. And, it also became a place to play cards and drink on Fridays and Saturdays.”
This shows that Swiss people heavily influenced Jiri Bazaar. Their influence is evident as the local Jiri Bazaar got the name Lincoln Bazaar and is still known as the same.

"As mountaineering has been a dream for scores, stakeholders are worried about irresponsible expeditions","Thursday, December 15, 2022","In the spring of 2016, Furdiki Sherpa, a widow, climbed Everest.
With the slogan Hami Pani Sakchhaun (we can also do it), Furdiki and Nima Doma Sherpa, also a widow, did the mountaineering expedition together. Both of them lost their husbands on Everest and the two, tired of crying, wanted to move on. The only way for that was to do something their husbands did for a living, mountaineering, they thought.
In 2016, Furdiki was obsessed with Everest. She wanted to see for herself what the fuss was all about and why people went to the mountain despite all the risks. Fast forward to 2022, Furdiki now has become more conscious about Everest and other mountains.
Speaking at the Seventh International Mountain Festival held in Pokhara on December 10, she said people do not respect the mountains anymore.
Other participants of the session including author Lukpa Futi Sherpa, trekker Funjo Lama and mountaineer and photojournalist Purnima Shrestha also discussed changes that are occurring recently in the mountains.
Although Furdiki climbed a mountain, representing widows, she is not happy. Why? Because everything in the mountains has changed, she says.
“It’s not just the snow that’s disappearing, culture and traditions are there too,” says Furdiki.
Furdiki says that the Everest she saw in her childhood when her father, an icefall doctor, took her to base camp, and the Everest of the current time has drastically changed.
“The mountain has changed. Even the base camp has changed. The effects of global warming on the icefall are clear, yet no one from the mountaineering world is doing anything,” says Furdiki.
Furdiki believes the mountaineers and mountaineering expedition companies are the major cause of declining snow in the Khumbu region. Due to their negligence, the snow and culture of the Khumbu region are at risk, she says.
“I believe, it’s the fault of big tour and expedition companies. They provide luxurious mountaineering expeditions to tourists, which are actually affecting the mountain environments. Their activities are doing a lot of harm to both the culture and environment,” says Furdiki.
For example, instead of setting up four to five tents, they fix one single big tent, occupying a large amount of area. To set up that big tent, the companies appoint the Sherpas to dig the glacier for a month to create space for them and their clients.
Furdiki says she has observed a lot of differences between going to Everest in 2019 and at the end of November 2022. Currently, it is hard to recognise Everest Base Camp.
“I wish the big companies would change their attitude on the mountain,” she says.
Many initiatives to clean the mountains have been initiated, but none have been successful on Everest. Mountaineering expeditions leave all their waste in the mountain and as a result, the mountain environment has remained excessively polluted.
“I think the mountains have never been cleaned,” says Furdiki. “Our cultures can only be preserved if the mountains are preserved.”
Furdiki also complains about the helicopters that travel around mountain regions. Helicopters have caused destruction rather than development, she says. According to her, the transportation of goods on helicopters has affected the life of the people in mountains.
To provide luxury for their clients on the Everest expedition, big mountaineering companies transport goods by helicopters. These goods include gas heaters and gas geysers and now they even transport coffee machines and ovens. Even the goods that humans can carry are transported by helicopters. Tents, plywood and steel everything is transported to base camp by helicopter, she says.
She also argues that helicopters have created noise pollution in the mountains. It has made life hard there. The helicopters fly more than birds there, laments Furdiki.
“Flying helicopters in the mountain region is not in the interest of foreigners but of Nepali tour and expedition companies. They earn a lot of money through it,” says Furdiki.
For commercial purposes under the pretext of emergency rescue, Nepali businesses are flying helicopters around mountains in big numbers.
Trekker Funjo Lama also agrees that the mountains are turning snowless. He also echoes Furdiki adding that luxurious expeditions are affecting mountain environments.
Like Furdiki, Lama, who is born and raised in mountains, has also observed many changes in the mountains along with the popularity of mountaineering. While growing up, he experienced heavy snowfall during December and January. But now, it rarely happens as it rains a lot in the mountains.
“In a bid to provide luxury, we have forgotten who we are and what our culture is,” he says.
Lama also narrates how the negligence in mountains has caused natural disasters and impacted the locals. Just a few months back, an avalanche hit Manaslu. This was caused due to recklessness in mountaineering expeditions. The mountaineers returned from helicopters but the locals are still suffering from the roadblocks caused by natural disasters.
Mountaineer Lakpa Futi Sherpa urges concerned bodies to make effective policies for conserving mountains.

Saarang: Young students’ initiative to tell the world stories about Nepal’s touristy sites,"Sunday, December 11, 2022","When Nepal was in between the Covid lockdowns, Sachin Dangi went out of Kathmandu with his friend and reached Chisapanigadhi in Makawanpur, some kilometres south of Kathmandu, taking their time to travel to different parts of the country in their free time. But, it was locked.
They almost returned thinking the opportunity to visit the historic site was lost, but they asked around and got the contact information of a priest there. “When he arrived, he took us on a tour of the gadhi (a kind of fort) and told some amazing stories of the Anglo-Nepal war, from where the enemy attacked and how gallantly the Nepali side fought,” shares Dangi.
“We then came back amazed and happy. Then, I started contemplating on how many stories could we unlock when we opened the gates of the gadhi.”
Dangi’s contemplation later became the motivation for him to start Saarang, a platform created by students to enhance and enrich the travel experiences of the [domestic and foreign] tourists with stories related to the landmarks including cultural, natural and historical heritage sites across Nepal.
In just 10 months of operation, Saarang has already put up 100 boards with their QR scans in various landmarks across Kathmandu valley. And soon they are making their mark outside the valley too.  According to the team, it aims to bridge the gap in the tourism sector of Nepal where tour guides or guided tours are not available.
Saarang is a web platform designed and conceptualised to aid tourists in their visits to important landmarks. It has integrated its QR code in majorly 10×12 inch boards on the sites for people to scan.
The platform includes stories in text or audio format that anyone can access through their mobile phones, and get to know the landmarks they visit more closely. This enables the Saarang team to tell the stories in real time.
To break the language barrier and add value, the team has also integrated a tool that translates the stories into major languages of the world. Saarang claims this sets it apart from other websites.
Saarang boards are currently present at Budhanilakantha, Palanchok, Thamel, Dakshinkali, Janakpur and Lumbini. Tourists visiting these sites can simply just scan the QR code the team has put up in the landmarks and enjoy the stories on their websites. At Thamel and Lumbini, it has also kept a separate QR code to take the tourists on a guided tour, based on their location.
Users do not have to log in or create an account; it is easily available for all.
Registered as a private research company in February 2021, Saarang has collected and archived more than 100 stories from the locals, the authorities and the local historians. It is managed and run by four undergraduate business and IT students at King’s College during their after-college hours.
The main person behind the idea is Sachin Dangi (23), the CEO of Saarang. His colleagues are Diwakar Rizal (23), Sushant Gaire (23) and Ashish Katuwal (22). Dangi looks at product development and user experiences and Rizal is in charge of research product design. He also writes or compiles the stories. Gaire looks after board placements, their instalments and technology while Katuwal creates social media content.
Dangi shares that his teachers have also helped a lot to set it up.
“After I emailed my idea to my teachers, one of them told me that it was an idea worth working on and making a viable product. So, with his confidence and mentorship, we applied for Otharo, a six-month incubation programme of our college, and formulated the idea into today’s web-based application.”
When they started research to prepare for the platform, they first went to talk to the tourists. They found that they were facing the same problem as their experience at Chisapani, even in Kathmandu. They also learned it would aid those who are inquisitive and eager to learn about the stories behind the places but have always hesitated to ask people.
Within three to four months into the operation, Saarang added a board in Budhanilakantha and to its surprise, it got enough hits within the first week. So far, Saarang has got some 8,000 hits from the single board. “The number is overwhelming.”
Dangi shares an anecdote. “There was a mother and a son who was staying in line to enter the temple. To the bored son, the mother asked him to go scan the QR code and listen to the stories while they waited. A friend of mine was just behind them and she called me up and shared the experience with me; it was heart-warming to know.”
So far, the team has collected stories majorly from the authorities. “Many authorities we collaborated with [for example, in Lumbini and Janakpur] already had enough stories in their collection. So with their permission, we integrated the stories into our platform.” But, it is not always the case.
As per Dangi, there are many stories that clash with each other and the communities express their disapproval of the stories shared by others. Fact-checking them or getting the communities to agree on one has posed some problems.
However, the innovators say, more than communities, the painful bureaucratic process in the public offices has been their headache. “We call up the reception of the offices to approach the officials. But it has been a waiting game. It is really a hassle when we have to go to the same office four or five times to meet anyone and pass the proposal. A few proposals have been collecting dust for months now.”
It is also hard to work without a connection and some officials question their work just because they are students, according to Dangi.
Rizal adds, “They have turned us back citing festivals, local elections, year-ends and parliamentary elections. It is demotivating at the least.”
But, Dangi finds it ironic, “They are the same people who complain that the youth of this country are going abroad and not working here. Yet when youth like us go knocking on their doors, they shut it in our face.”
But when they got through, he stresses, that platform has been useful. “We were previously worried that there would be a backlash from the tour guides in Lumbini. But, we found that the guides have been using the stories to their advantage.”
For Saarang, the next stop is Pokhara. With plans already in place, within the next month, the team plans to extend its presence in the country’s tourism capital.
Apart from that, the team also is gearing towards launching its app. “So far, we have had to rely on the free internet facilities available or the cellular data as it is a web-based app. But, soon, we are launching the mobile app, hopefully in January 2023, and overcoming the access gap too.”
He explains further, “With our mobile app, the tourists will be able to scan and enjoy the stories, guided tour and also get the top recommendation of the nearest eateries and recreations to explore and personalise their experience further.”
So far, the team’s revenue has been generated from the boards installed. But, with the integration, it hopes to generate more revenue from other platforms too.
The Saarang team is also looking into integrating podcasts and other videos into the platform.
If anyone wants to collaborate or wants to expand the platform in their area, the team says it is ready to collaborate.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/saarang-nepal-tourists-guided-tours.html,travel
Tourists’ inflow is on the rise in post-Covid Nepal. Stakeholders demand a sustainability plan,"Sunday, December 11, 2022","The past three months have seen a drastic rise in foreign tourists entering the country. On average, around 49,000 foreign tourists per month entered Nepal in the 11 months of 2022. This is good news for the tourism industry that suffered a major setback due to the Covid pandemic as monthly tourist arrivals in some months of 2020 and 2021 were zero.
Director of Nepal Tourism Board, Maniraj Lamichhane, says things look good for the tourism sector. According to Lamichhane, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimated that 2023 would see a revival in tourist arrivals somewhere between 60 to 63 per cent of the world compared to 2019.
“The increment is something similar compared to the end of 2019,” says Lamichhane.
According to the Nepal Tourism Board, a total of 546,216 tourists have come to Nepal as of November. According to this, an average of 49,656 tourists come to Nepal every month. In November alone, 72,653 tourists came to Nepal.
This was still less than the 2019 numbers when over 130,000 tourists came to Nepal in November alone and over a million in the year. As usual, most tourists still come to Nepal for adventure tourism as a majority of them come to trek in the high mountains and some climb them. The number has continued to rise despite issues like Covid and dengue.
But, tourism professionals say although the statistics show good signs, the old challenges still remain. Nilhari Bastola, the president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN), says that the arrival of non-resident Nepalis also played a role in the rapid increase in international tourist arrivals after the Covid pandemic.
“The arrival of many non-resident Nepalis, who have not been able to come to Nepal for a long time, has also increased the number,” he says, “The numbers look great, but its impact on the revival of tour companies and hotels is yet to be seen.”
During October and November, small and big hotels in Kathmandu, including those in Thamel, were full. Youb Raj Shrestha, a member of the working committee of the Hotel Association of Nepal (HAN), says that Indian tourists have a big role to play in this.
However, if you take the data into consideration, there is a big mismatch. As most Indian tourists come via land, their entry number is not included in the NTB’s list because it counts only tourists who come via aeroplanes.
Shrestha says many tourists come to Nepal via land as airfare between Kathmandu and Delhi exceeds Rs 45,000. As a result, many drive their own vehicles and come to Nepal and results were seen in Pokhara, Thamel and Sauraha as these areas were full of Indian tourists.
After the Covid pandemic, many international celebrities and well-known YouTubers visited Nepal. This resulted in the country getting free publicity, internationally.
As the world was fighting Covid, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the prince of Bahrain, came to climb Mount Everest in March 2021. At a time when tourist arrivals were at a standstill, his visit was discussed around the world.
After that, the shooting of the Bollywood movie Uunchai also helped as actors like Boman Irani, Pariniti Chopra and Anupam Kher promoted Nepal through their social media pages.
Finalists of BBC Master Chef also came to Nepal and promoted Nepali food. This year, Bear Grylls, known to the world from Man vs Wild, came to Nepal. His arrival also earned a good buzz in the international tourism market as he skydived in the Everest region.
Meanwhile, famous YouTubers and aviation vloggers also came to Nepal one after another. Because of their positive talks of Nepal, they have played a positive role in the post-Covid recovery, as per tourism experts.
Along with the rise in tourist arrivals, the country’s revenue generation from tourism is also improving. According to the figures of Nepal Rastra Bank, in the first three months of the current fiscal year 2022/23, the country has earned Rs 11.4 billion from tourism alone.
In the first three months of the previous fiscal year 2021/22, the income from tourism was Rs 5.42 billion while the year before that was only Rs 1.48 billion.
In order to revive tourism after the 2015 earthquake, the Nepal Tourism Board launched a campaign to convey the message that Nepal was a safe place to travel. Nepal Tourism Board also started a campaign to promote domestic tourism to help the tourism industry. A campaign was begun to replace all the old pictures on Google that showed Nepal monuments, which were reduced to rubble.
However, after Covid, the government and the NTB have no such plan as many complain these bodies have failed the tourism sector.
The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, which announced a plan to observe Visit Nepal Decade before the general elections, has since slowed down. The ministry does not have a proper plan for implementing this. Even though it set up stalls in different tourism fares, experts say this is not enough.

7 Nepali mountaineers who made Nepal famous,"Sunday, December 11, 2022","Nepali mountaineers have been the backbone of almost all the Himalayan expeditions starting from the early 1930s. Their support has been unparalleled as thousands of foreigners have reached the summit of high mountains thanks to their help.
Their hardiness, expertise and experience at high altitudes are renowned all over the world. Known to the outside world as Sherpas, these mountaineers and guides are more than just muscles as many claim them to be. Their ability to fix ropes tackling high winds and bitter temperatures even back in the day when mountaineering gears were non-existent is one of the reasons why they are respected and reputed all over the world. No wonder only a few were surprised as a team of 10 Nepali mountaineers summited K2 in harsh winter conditions creating history in the process.
Here, we bring you a list of a few mountaineers, some well-known and others not so much, but whose names have been forever etched in mountaineering’s hall of fame.
Tenzing Norgay is known all over the world. He is probably the first mountain guide from the Khumbu region to have etched his name in history books all around the world as he reached the top of the world with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953, the first-ever successful Everest summit. That was his seventh Everest expedition and probably his last, according to Jamling Norgay Sherpa’s book.
Giving it all he got, he climbed Everest having been involved in mountaineering for nearly two decades. Those who remember Tenzing Norgay call him a leader. No wonder foreigners kept picking him to join them on their expeditions. Before him, all Nepali mountaineers climbed for money. Tenzing Norgay did too. But, he also wanted to summit. His ambition to become the first is what stands him out on this list.
Many may not have heard about Ang Tharkay, but an argument can be made about him being even greater than everyone, even Tenzing Norgay himself. Born in Kunde, Ang Tharkay, like Tenzing Norgay, spent much of his time in Darjeeling where he looked for work as a porter. He started to catch foreign climbers’ eye quite quickly and was on his way to Everest in 1933 with Britishers. His leadership quality and performance in attitude started getting him both respect and job as he became Eric Shipton’s right-hand man.
Apart from various Everest expeditions he went on, it was his 1950 Annapurna expedition with a French team that made him famous. Having guided for many parts of the expedition, Ang Thakrey turned down the chance to be the first to summit Annapurna with the French team as he stayed a few 100 metres below to let the French bask in the glory. This, according to Maurice Herzog, is one of the most selfless acts anyone has done on the mountain.
Another climber who is not talked about much is Gaylay Sherpa. Like Ang Tharkey, Gaylay was also selfless. His sacrifices in the mountains is another reason why Nepali mountaineers are regarded so highly around the world. Why? Here is a story.
In 1934, Galay went to Nanga Parbat in Pakistan with a German team. The weather was bad, treacherous even. But, the climbers pushed on. With no chance of a summit, they decided to retreat, but the expedition leader Willi Merkl could not move. Most members of the expedition had died and only Gaylay, Merkl and one more climber were alive. As the other climber went to get help, Merkel had asked him to go with him, but Gaylay denied. He stayed with his employer, loyal to him till he froze to death with him.
One often looks for firsts when it comes to mountaineering. A first ascent is always regarded highly among the mountaineers especially if its an 8,000-metre peak. But, what about two? Galzen Norbu, another name missing out from Nepal’s history books is the first person to have made successful ascents of two 8,000 metre peaks.
His leadership in Makalu in 1955 with a French team gained him a lot of plaudits, which is why a Japanese team in 1956 hired him as the lead Sherpa to take them to the top of Manaslu. His photo atop the summit of Manalsu is what many call one of the most iconic pictures in the Himalayan mountaineering.
Babu Chiri was a NatGeo adventure/athlete even before anything like that was invented. First, in 1995, he climbed Everest twice in the same season. But, that was not enough for him. In 1999, he did something even more ridiculous. Carrying a tent to the top of the world, he pitched it and spent nearly 21 hours on the summit, without bottled oxygen and sang the national anthem. In 2000, he wanted to be more ambitious as he climbed Everest in under 17 hours where it takes people at least three days. It remains to be seen what might have become of him who died in 2001 as he fell into a crevasse while taking a photograph.
The Snow Leopard who passed away recently was a legend and an inspiration to many mountaineers of today. Ang Rita remains the only person to have climbed Everest 10 times without bottled oxygen, one of them in the harsh winters. He said he never needed oxygen even at the death zone and once spent the whole night doing aerobic exercises to stay warm around camp 4. He was so good at an altitude that he did not use bottled oxygen in any of the ascents of Dhaulagiri, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga. Ang Tsering of Asian Treks in an interview once called him the best climber he has ever climbed with. He was a legend, a master climber.
Pasang Lhamu’s inclusion on this list does not even need thinking. She inspired a generation of women in Nepal showing them that if you work hard enough, no dream is unachievable as she reached the summit of Everest in 1993, becoming the first Nepali woman to do so. Even though that joy was short-lived as she died during the descent, reaching the summit of Everest which not many women had done clearly shows how courageous and determined she was to prove people wrong.
For achieving what no other Nepali woman had achieved before her, Pasang Lhamu was honoured by mountaineers all around the world in various ways. She was the very first woman to be decorated with the “Nepal Tara (Star)” by King Birendra.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/famous-mountaineers-nepal.html,travel
2 Indians travel to Nepal to highlight electric vehicle possibilities in South Asia,"Saturday, December 10, 2022","Due to inadequate infrastructure for charging a battery, people tend to think that travelling long distances on an electric vehicle is challenging in Nepal. However, two persons from India—Ashish Arora and Praphulla Kolhe—are proving it wrong by travelling from India to Nepal on an electric vehicle.
They are aiming to travel 25 thousand kilometres, following the India-Nepal-Bhutan-India route. They began their journey on October 28. We want to spread the message that there is a higher possibility of electric vehicles in South Asia, we need to see our future on it, says Arora.
A few years back, Arora of Delhi went through a serious throat infection and he had surgery. Afterwards, the doctor advised him to stay in a healthy environment. He went to Canada for some time to overcome his health issues. And as he returned to India, his infection flared up again. Air pollution was its cause.
However, due to Covid 19 and the lockdown, the environment was somewhat pollution free. Nevertheless, after the lockdown, Arora decided to take initiative for creating a pollution-free environment. “We have big hospitals, innovations, doctors and scientists but don’t have a healthy environment.”
So he decided to take the initiative that he could for a healthy environment and he left his petroleum car and purchased an electric vehicle. Since then, Arora has been encouraging people to use EVs in India. He makes friends with people who use electric vehicles. He also shares and listens to the experience of others who are using EVs. “EV is easy to use in everyday life. Now it can be part of everyone’s life.” To spread this message, Arora is now in Nepal with his friend Kolhe.
Both of them shared their experience of travelling six thousand kilometres and eight states of India in Tata Nexon Max, an electric car, with Onlinekhabar.
Arora has created a What’s app group of people who use EVs. According to Arora, there are also some Nepali in the group. Arora from Delhi and Kolhe of Hyderabad met each other through the What’s app group. And having the same intention of spreading the message about pollution-free vehicles, they decided on the tour.
Many people are still doubtful about the EV, which has recently started earning popularity globally. But Arora and Kolhe have tried to break the scepticism about EV by travelling such a long way on it.
They reached Nepal after travelling to Telangana, Maharashtra, Madya Pradesh, Hariyani, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Srinagar and Ladakh. They entered Nepal from Bhairava and stayed in a hotel near Pashupati.
Many might think whether it is possible to travel in an EV for such long hours or not. But Arora and Kolhe have already completed one-third of their planned destination and have arrived in Kathmandu. According to Arora, neither the road nor the charging infrastructure disturbed their tour.
The environment is being created for electric vehicles in South Asia, says Kolhe. Road security, charging stations, technology, battery management and all others were in favour of EVs.
On this tour, they travelled to roads of different structures. Their EV crossed an express highway, semi-pitched and dirt road. But the car did not put them in trouble in any place.
The ground clearance of the car easily helped them to cross dirt roads.
This journey has increased my confidence towards electric vehicles, says Kolhe. The South Asian nation should rapidly start using EVs, the duo says. “Let’s increase the number of EVs and develop more charging stations.”

Why eastern Nepal needs to promote tea tourism,"Friday, December 9, 2022","Tourism is one of the mainstays of the Nepali economy and a major source of foreign revenues. Possessing eight of the ten highest mountains in the world, Nepal is an ideal destination for mountaineers, rock climbers, and people seeking adventures. But, now, it also needs to identify and promote other possibilities of tourism as economic challenges are ever-growing across the world. Tea tourism can be a good option for the country’s eastern part towards achieving economic independence and prosperity.
Tourism is a vital part of the 21st-century economic system, contributing to the modernisation and development of both the economy and society as a whole. In the past, besides having immense possibilities for tourism, Nepal’s tourism industry is oriented only towards a single dimension and focused more on mountaineering and adventure tourism. The other forms of tourism like wildlife tourism, ecotourism, tea tourism, and cultural tourism are not given much interest by the government sector while making tourism plans and policies.
In recent years, these branches of tourism have boomed into an eye-catching industry across the world because of the significant role they play in stimulating consumption, promoting trade, and experiences and enhancing international communication. Nepal has great potential and opportunity to progress as a tourism hub and take benefits by developing these forms of tourism.
Tea tourism is now considered a part of the global production, marketing, and consumption of tea. Many countries see it as a new way to diversify their tourism market and improve their economies.
Ilam is one of the main tea-growing districts of Nepal and a pioneer in tea cultivation. The tea cultivation that began in the country from Ilam in 1920 has spread to 44 districts of the country.
Situated in the green lap of Ilam surrounded by the greeneries and dressed with the beauties of nature, the Kanyam tea garden is one of the most visited tea hotspots of tourism in Nepal. Located in the eastern district of Ilam, Kanyam is the heart of Nepali orthodox tea production.
Due to its wonders such as cool temperate weather, abundant green hills and beautiful tea gardens surrounded by dense natural forests, it has become a choice for thousands of domestic and foreign visitors annually. The panoramic view of Mount Kanchanjunga and other breathtaking landscapes from Kanyam are unlike any view around the world. A person can take an excursion for a day from Phikkal Bazaar to Kanyam.
Several hotels and resorts can be found in the town as well as within a few walking distances of the tea gardens. Visitors can enjoy horse riding, hiking, photography and astounding scenarios across the whole area. Kanyam is ranked among the top popular picnic spots and tourist destinations in eastern Nepal.
The tea sector has great possibilities in terms of overall economic development. There are numerous opportunities for tourism, including ecotourism, teahouse trekking, and tea culture tourism.
The famous tea garden of Shree Antu is another source of attraction for visitors to observe the sunrise. Annually, thousands of Nepali and Indian tourists from Darjeeling, Sikkim, Siliguri, and Kolkata visit Shree Antu. It is a village that takes you to a paradise surrounded by pleasant tea gardens, pine forests, a view of the Terai plains and the settlements showing their unique culture and lifestyle. If you are excited about tea picking, the hosts will provide you with a basket made of bamboo fabric where you pluck the young tea leaves. You can further choose to be dressed like a local while picking up the tea leaves and look like the local.
Tea tourism offers part-time opportunities such as hosting guests or running homestays in their houses. Many locals have found work as tour guides or as owners of tea houses, souvenir stores, and other businesses in this sector. The tea-producing region has reached a new stage for host-guest interactions as tourism has grown, empowering people to make changes in society. Indeed, Ilam has lots of potential to prosper with the help of tea tourism.
Tea is not just a commodity for the people of Nepal, but also a way of our life. Tea is the first drink one has in the morning and is the most common drink offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Tea tourism is a kind of cultural tourism with learning tea-related knowledge, tea tasting, and sightseeing in tea gardens, integrated with leisure activities of sightseeing, business, learning, tea leaf handpicking, and tea shopping. It is an action for tourists to experience and enjoy the natural ecosystem and authentic folkway in tea-growing areas and to get educated.
Tea tourism can be linked to various arrays of tourism like ecotourism and community-based tourism. It is not only the reputation of the famous tea and the geographic characteristics of the natural environment that are key to developing tea tourism.
With the rise in tea tourism, travel agencies have introduced tea house treks to Nepal for visitors, and tea lovers from Germany, France, Canada, and the United States are showing interest in these packages. In addition, the government has been promoting tea-producing districts, particularly Ilam and Dhankuta, as ecotourism destinations.

Budhha Air to fly bigger aircraft to Surkhet,"Wednesday, December 7, 2022","Kathmandu, December 7
Owing to the rising demand, Budhha Air has decided to fly its ATR-72 aircraft to Surkhet from December 16.
Prior to this, Buddha Air only flew its smaller ATR-42 aircraft to Surkhet from Kathmandu.
As the smaller aircraft could not hold many passengers, the fare for Kathmandu-Surkhet route is quite high and many had complained to Buddha Air, demanding a bigger aircraft hoping that would decrease the air fare.
Accordingly, the airline company will now fly ATR 72 aircraft on this route. The company says that the operating expenses will be reduced which will result in cheaper fares for passengers.
The minimum fare set for the Kathmandu-Surkhet route is Rs 7,000.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/budhha-air-to-fly-bigger-aircraft-to-surkhet.html,travel
Sikles in the Annapurna region will soon boast a cable car. What will be its impacts?,"Wednesday, December 7, 2022","Kaski, where lies Nepal’s tourism capital Pokhara, is likely to have another cable car service. Sikles Annapurna Cable Car Pvt Ltd is going to build a cable car system in Sikles of Madi rural municipality.
The company has already submitted the environmental impact assessment report to the Ministry of Forests and Environment and has received permission for the project.
Whereas tourism entrepreneurs are hopeful of the impact the Sikles cable car project would make on their business, some concerns have also been raised about its possible negative effects on the natural environment there.
According to the plan, the project will be implemented in wards 1 and 2 of Madi rural municipality. The lower station of the cable car service will be in ward 2 and the upper station in ward 1. The lower station will be in Pwaryum of Sikles, and the upper station will be in Kori Danda. The Sikles cable car project will cover a distance of 6.5 kilometres.
The project’s total investment is estimated to be around Rs 6.9 billion. The project will cover a total of 27.99 hectares of land. The lower station will spread over 7.46 hectares, the mid-station will cover 2.04 hectares of area. Similarly, the top station will span 5.76 hectares of the area. The tower will be built on 12.76 hectares of land. This cable car will be in service for 30 years.
The project is 230 kilometres far from Kathmandu. Similarly, Pokhara International Airport is 30 kilometres away from the project.
According to the company, there will also be a walking trail from the lower station to the upper station.
This cable car will be different from other existing cable car systems in Nepal as it will include an additional station between the lower and upper stations. The passengers can be picked up and dropped off there. The middle station will be placed in ward 2 of Madi rural municipality, nearby Dharamshala.
According to the project design, the cable car will have 60 gondolas. In each gondola, eight people can travel at once. The cable car system has the capacity to hold 6,000 people per day. There will be 30 towers for the cable car system.
The company aims to complete the project within three and a half years. A year has been allocated for the pre-construction preparation phase.
Altogether 600 people will get employment during the construction phase and 50 people will be directly employed in its operational phase. It is mentioned that the cable car will consume 2,000 kilowatts of electricity per day.
The company claims that this project will greatly benefit Sikles in particular and the Gandaki province and the entire country in general.
It is mentioned in the report that a total of 3,801 trees and poles have to be cut down for the Sikles cable car project.
But, rhododendron trees and several other species of trees will be chopped to implement the Sikles cable car project. To compensate for the deforestation, the company needs to plant the number of trees mentioned by law.
Nonetheless, the company claims that this “environment-friendly” transportation will help in preserving the environment of the Annapurna area. The accomplishment of the project will help in the growth of the local hotels, tourism spots and businesses related to the tourism sector, states the report.

Red panda conservation in Nepal can be key to ecotourism in the high Himalayas. Here’s how,"Sunday, December 4, 2022","Communities are the heart of any biodiversity conservation activities and their role is crucial for the success of any programme. We realised it more while spending a week in Sandakpur of Ilam and watching red pandas, which made our trip a satisfying one.
Red pandas are endangered species legally protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar; that was not new information for us. But, we came to know about the community-based red panda conservation projects of the Red Panda Network in Nepal. In 2007, it initiated a project Punde Kundo, believed to be the world’s first community-based red panda conservation project in eastern Nepal.
Indeed, these kinds of projects have been a frontline for the livelihood improvement of locals by promoting ecotourism in the high Himalayas while significantly contributing to conservation efforts.
Red Panda Network began its journey with the hope to establish a suitable habitat for the animal in the nearby forests of Sandakpur, joining hands with the local community. Reaching the people who live among the red pandas and imparting knowledge about how a community could play a role in their conservation were the targeted objectives of the project.
Currently, there are 110 forest guardians in different project area districts of Nepal. To minimise illegal trade and hunting of these animals, anti-poaching programmes are being conducted. After the inception of these programmes, there have not been any reports of red panda snares and traps during habitat monitoring and patrolling, no confiscations of panda pelts by Nepal Police and Division Forest Offices and no arrests (in any part of Nepal) for smuggling the pelts.
The organisation is funding and appointing forest guardians in different districts of Nepal to ensure the protection of small animals and minimise illegal hunting and trade.
Moreover, only four cases were reported in eastern Nepal amongst 121 cases reported during the last 12 years. Then the PIT (Panchthar-Ilam-Taplejung) corridor in eastern Nepal successfully achieved zero poaching from the year 2019 to 2021 and these statistics indicate the effectiveness of ongoing conservation projects.
After the extension of red panda conservation projects in western Nepal, from 2017 onwards, the illegal trade has fallen as compared to the past. However, following the Covid pandemic and nationwide lockdown, the number of illegal trades increased in the country (37 pelts confiscated), which may be due to the economic enforcement limitations related to the pandemic and poverty.
Rural poverty continues to show a disturbing correlation with conservation even in the richest biodiversity hotspots. Local people are unable to make wildlife conservation a priority since they are struggling for food and shelter.
Realising this fact, a homestay programme was introduced in the Choyatar and Dobato villages of Sandakpur in 2010 to improve the living standard of the community and to boost conservation works together.
A lot of progressive changes have arisen from the homestay programme. Every homestay has allocated 15 per cent of its annual income for red panda conservation since the date of its commencement.
These home-based businesses have helped local families by generating income and providing visitors with a safe and affordable place to stay while learning more about local customs, food, and, of course, wildlife.
These initiatives have promoted the local culture and a rotational hosting system is used by the villagers to welcome guests, which ensures financial equality, and benefit-sharing, and enhances community cooperation.
It has awakened local people to realise the value of the conservation of such iconic species in our country. Homestay owners have understood that red pandas should be conserved not only for them but also for future generations.
Annually, a large number of global visitors come to watch these animals in the wild for a unique experience, research, and wildlife photography. The recent study findings have shown evidence of a growing red panda population in the country.
As many as 104 community forests of Nepal are engaged with community-based monitoring in collaboration with the organisation to protect red pandas in their range. Despite these efforts, harvesting of fuel wood, and timber, overgrazing and construction of rural roads and trekking routes have some impact on forest resources.
And, there still lingers the challenging issues for conservation due to the lack of information on a landscape level, bottlenecks, potential corridors, people’s perception and habitat degradation. Therefore, future conservation should be research-oriented and have a mechanism for problem-solving, which are the vital needs for sustainable red panda conservation in Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/red-panda-conservation-ecotourism.html,travel
"NAC to operate Doha, Kuala Lumpur flights from Bhairahawa airport from Dec 19 onwards","Thursday, December 1, 2022","Kathmandu, December 1
Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), Nepal’s national flag carrier, has decided to operate international flights from the Gautam Buddha International Airport, popularly known as Bhairahawa airport, from December 19.
In the first phase, it will hold direct flights to Doha in Qatar and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) approved the schedule proposed by the NAC for a duration from December 19, 2022, to March 25, 2023.
There will be two flights on the Bhairahawa-Doha route and one flight on the Bhairahawa-Kuala Lumpur route every week, as per the approved schedule.

Nepal trekkers seek a better system to replace ‘useless’ TIMS cards ahead of the Visit Nepal Decade,"Thursday, December 1, 2022","Jacob Pablo came to Nepal from Australia to do the famous three-pass trek in the Khumbu region in September. Before heading to Jiri, Pablo went to the Nepal Tourism Board to get the tourist permits required for the trek. There, he was told he needed the national park permit fee along with a “TIMS card“.
“I told them I had heard that the TIMS wasn’t necessary for the Everest region, but they told us we needed it so we bought it,” Pablo wrote on Facebook.
But, during his nearly 30-day trek around the region, he did not have to show the TIMS card even once. Neither did anyone he met have to show it. Pablo felt cheated that the government of Nepal had forced him to buy something that he did not need.
“It serves zero practical or legal purpose. I would tell people not to trust Nepal’s tourism office,” he wrote.
As trekking in the country has picked up in recent months, many foreign tourists have once again started to question the purpose of the TIMS card. Officials say the idea behind the TIMS (Trekking Information Management System) was to keep data of trekkers in a database which could then be accessed in case of accidents and/or natural calamities. But, in over a decade, it has not served its purpose.
Every year, Nepal records at least a few cases of trekkers missing in the high Himalayas. Even though these people get TIMS cards, they are seldom found. With the Visit Nepal Decade being announced, the number of trekkers will continue to rise. This once again has started a debate if Nepal needs a better trekker management system than the TIMS card to ensure the safety of trekkers in the country.
The idea of the Trekking Information Management System, or TIMS, was simple: to keep a record of people travelling to various areas in the country above a certain altitude. Started in 2008, guides and tourists say TIMS was practical during its early years as checkpoints were set up on all popular treks and trekkers would sign in as a way of showing they were safe.
But, a lack of communication between checkpoints and a lack of technology (no internet or electricity) caused massive issues to ensure that the trekkers reached the other checkpoint.
“The only way anyone found out if someone was actually missing was if they emailed or called the tourism office. This happens to date,” says David Ways, the founder of MissinigTrekkers.com, an informational website set up to help families, friends and others who are searching for missing trekkers in Nepal.
But despite questions raised about its need, people are still made to acquire TIMS cards, each of which costs Rs 300 to Rs 2,000 depending on their nationality, but no one knows where the money is going.
The Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, the local government overseeing major tourism attractions in the Everest region, irked by a lack of clarity on the issue, stopped checking trekkers for the TIMS cards and started to issue its own local permit in 2017.
“Nothing was being done for our region. They were making so much money issuing cards for people entering Khumbu and we weren’t getting any investment to make the region better,” says Mohan Prasad Chapagain, the local government’s chief administrative officer.
Nepal Tourism Board knows this, but with the support of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN), it continues issuing TIMS cards.
“What Khumbu has done is their right. The constitution gives them the right and we haven’t questioned it. But, I think it’s important to understand what TIMS is actually used for,” says TAAN president Nilhari Bastola.
According to him, revenues from TIMS cards go to the government coffers. Most of it is used for identifying new routes and marketing them. Apart from that, around 10 per cent of the funds are also used during emergencies when a guide or a porter falls ill during the trek.
“It’s for the safety of the people who make trekking easy for foreigners. People think this is a waste of money, but it’s not,” says Bastola.
But, TAAN knows that there is a risk of other rural municipalities following the same route as Khumbu and stopping checking TIMS cards, which will eventually end it.
Meanwhile, Nepal Tourism Board did not respond to Onlinekhabar’s queries regarding the practicality of TIMS cards.
Calls have already started along the Annapurna base camp route to follow Khumbu as they believe that the money is not being spent on the development of the tourism sector or the trails.
“We understand this might happen and are looking at how we can stop it from happening,” says Bastola. He says TAAN is mulling over introducing a chip system, through which they can keep track of trekkers in the Himalayas. TAAN believes this would be beneficial for different tourists and can also be used by the embassies of their countries.
The other way he thinks TIMS can be replaced is by making a guide/porter compulsory while trekking in Nepal. He believes doing so will generate employment, ensure safety and have information on tourists at all times.
“We believe that no tourist should be allowed to trek without a guide or a porter. This has to be implemented,” says Bastola.
While officials such as Baskota continue to make propositions, Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality has already implemented the system. This year, it issued a trekking card for foreigners trekking alone in the region. Adhikari says the idea behind it was to do what TIMS was meant to do, to know the whereabouts of the tourists.
“We have software in place, which has the data and photograph of the solo trekkers or those who come without a guide or a porter,” says Chapagain, adding the rural municipality wants to do its best to ensure that all tourists who come to trek in the area are safe.
But, tourist like James Choice, who was forced to buy both the TIMS card and trek card, is not pleased. Rather, he is irritated by the system of double authorisation. It was time Nepal’s tourism officials coordinated and consulted each other before coming up with plans like these, he advises.
“I can understand the requirement to have information for safety about trekkers. But, it feels like two levels of government doing their own thing and not consulting with each other. Or maybe this is just about raising more money from unaware tourists,” says Choice.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tims-card-nepal-trekkers-redundant.html,travel

"Sandro Gromen-Hayes, known for K2 summit photos, wants to do the same on the world’s top 14 peaks","Sunday, November 27, 2022","Most people who reach the summit of K2 barely comprehend what they have achieved. Overwhelmed with emotions, out of breath and tired, these mountaineers rarely see what is around them. They reach the summit, take a few pictures, and are usually on their way down, spending less than 10 minutes on the top. But, in the summer of 2022, Sandro Gromen-Hayes did something no one had ever done.
On one of the most perfect days to climb the savage mountain, he took out his drone and flew it from the summit. From there, he showed K2 and the Karakoram as the world had never seen before.
“I got a bit lucky with the weather, but the shots came out quite nice. It was also great to finally summit K2 after years of trying,” says Hayes at a rooftop restaurant in Kathmandu.
Since then, he has become a superstar in terms of high-altitude photography. People from all over the world want him to cover their climbs in the Himalayas. His ability to climb and take perfect shots has put him up there with the best videographers and photographers in the world, but for Sandro Gromen-Hayes, being the best does not matter as he just wants to have fun and maybe in doing so climb the rest of the 14 highest mountains in the world.
“This is a fun job I do. It’s dangerous, but it’s fun and I hope I can continue to do this,” he says.
Gromen-Hayes grew up in the plains of London, far away from the mountains. As a millennial, he grew up partying with friends and doing anything to pass time. He says his mother tells him how he loved the camera but he developed a love for clicking pictures when he used his brother’s camera during high school.
“He taught me a little bit. But, then, I went to university to study engineering, which I failed. Then I decided to try my hand at photography and see where I could go with it.”
By this time, he was in love with the outdoors and particularly skiing. So, in 2011, he decided to spend a few months in Chamonix in France. To fund the trip, he worked for a hotel. And, whenever he was free, he would get out and ski.
In Chamonix, Gromen-Hayes fell in love with the outdoors and the mountains. Along with that, he also fell in love with photographing the outdoors.
“I think I found a purpose. It gave my life meaning of sorts. I was there having fun and doing what I loved. I also got to shoot the X-Games, which was pretty awesome.”
But, the joy was short-lived. It was hard to sustain a life in France so Gromen-Hayes decided to get back to England in 2013 and train to get into the Royal Marines. But on the side, he also started to help his friend make music videos in Birmingham.
“The more I used the camera, the better I got and I decided to live in Birmingham and get better at it.”
He spent the next three years in Birmingham doing odd shoots for music videos while working at a club and also shooting weddings.
“It was basically do anything to make money.”
Soon, Gromen-Hayes got bored with that life and decided to get into the British Army Reserve. He was not sure as he heard how the army organisation was full of racists. But, gladly, he found some like-minded free-spirited people and trained with them.
“It was good cause for two weeks of training, I would be allowed to do one week of skiing. For me, that was a worthwhile exchange as I could back to the mountains.”
He also took part in different adventurous training every year. He did a mountaineering course and filmed it and the army liked it so much that they made him the resident videographer.
“I became their climbing cameraman for a year shooting all their courses.”
Through it, Sandro Gromen-Hayes did his climbing courses and also learned to film in the mountains.
Things then moved up quite quickly for him. In 2016, a British Army team was going to Dhaulagiri for an expedition without oxygen or Sherpa support. He did not have a clue what they were talking about, yet as soon as he heard climbing, he said yes.
“I’d done like two weeks of alpine climbing in Switzerland and I thought I was ready even though I hadn’t a clue about Himalayan climbing, but I said let’s go.”
Soon, he realised how hard Himalayan climbing was. The trek up to base camp was hard. He developed altitude sickness but was not fully aware he kept on climbing with his bag, which was nearly 30 kg.
“I reached Camp 2. But, I got crazy sick. I didn’t sleep well or eat well. I knew I couldn’t carry on and thought that was it for me when it came to the Himalayas.”
But, fate had something else planned for Gromen-Hayes. The army decided to come back to Nepal to climb another 8000-er, this time Everest.
“It was the Gurkha expedition and I was doubting myself because I didn’t really do well in altitude but I couldn’t say no and decided just to go to base camp and shoot.”
But, Hayes wanted to climb more. He climbed up to camp 3 and felt good. He got good shots and was having fun. But, sadly, he could not summit as after the first group summited, the weather window went bad and the Gurkhas decided to end the expedition.
“I enjoyed the journey but was a little gutted. But I knew my time would come.”
The next year, Sandro Gromen-Hayes went to Afghanistan to climb Noshaq, the highest mountain in Afghanistan, to climb with an Afghan woman who was aiming to be the first to climb the mountain.
“This was the highest summit I’d done and it was with only a few people and I had so much fun. Reaching the summit during sunset was one of the most magical moments of my life.”
After this, he was approached by Nirmal Purja (Nimsdai), who was looking for someone to shoot his attempt to climb the 14, 8000-ers in record time.
“I had met him during the Gurkha expedition in 2017, but as he told me he didn’t have enough money to pay me, I didn’t go with him during his first leg.”
But, once, Purja shocked the world by climbing six 8000-ers in a month and got the funding, he joined him in Pakistan and also climbed Manaslu.
Gromen-Hayes also climbed Ama Dablam, Aconcagua and finally Everest. He was also with Purja during the K2 winter and did a lot of shooting. He even evolved as a photographer and videographer.
But, being at a high altitude has its fair challenges too. There are times he has to deal with impatient clients.
“I have a hard time catching up with some people after taking a shot because they are so fast and due to that we miss some great shots.”
There are times that Gromen-Hayes also feels a bit tedious. Because he has been going to the same place, again and again, he finds it tough to sometimes motivate himself.
“There are times when you have to think hard on what new you want to do, but then on a place like Ama Dablam or Everest, you just can close your eyes and shoot because the place is just too beautiful.”
But, the main challenge for him is the cold. He says filmmaking in the mountains is difficult as soon as your fingers get cold you need to warm them up.
“I do what I love so I think I don’t find things challenging.”
Gromen-Hayes calls himself very lazy and wonders how he has got himself here. But, he loves the mountains and the people he meets there. He feels he can be open to the universe and just wants to be happy.
“I meet people like me in the mountains. The Sherpas and some carefree mountaineers keep me going. Life is simple there and so magical.”
He says he loves Alaska for this reason. The mountains are open to everyone and accessible. Sandro Gromen-Hayes feels that more mountains around the world should be like that.
“I feel Nepal could be similar. The place is so much fun and I get a sense of adventure… not just in the mountains but even here in Thamel.”
When he has it shooting the mountains, he shoots people he meets to tell their stories. He made a video about a girl who grew up in a family of Gurkhas and her life. He also did a video about an ex-convict in Alaska while the man was talking to his wife who was crying her eyes out.
“Work makes me meet some interesting people.”
After his video on K2, Gromen-Hayes feels he was done with the big mountains. But, he was asked to film Kristin Harilla who was on her quest to beat Purja’s 14 peaks record.
Now, he wants to continue climbing big mountains and says is looking for a filming project and climbing all 14 8000-ers. The dream he says is to just hang out in the mountains with friends, making videos and shooting photos.

Himalaya Airlines begins daily Kuala Lumpur flights from Bhairahawa,"Friday, November 4, 2022","Kathmandu, November 4
After being forced by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, Himalaya Airlines has begun daily Kuala Lumpur flights from the Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa.
Himalaya has become the second airline company to start regular commercial flights and the first Nepali company to do so from Nepal’s second international airport.
Jazeera Airways has already been doing regular flights there.
Himalaya Airlines’ Vice-President Bijay Shrestha says the company has started daily chartered flights now, and if this becomes successful, scheduled flights will begin soon.
He says the company is also studying the possibility of regular flights to Myanmar from Bhairahawa.
As the new airport did not attract many airline companies, Nepal’s aviation regulator has been putting pressure on the companies operating daily international flights from the Kathmandu airport to shift some flights to Bhairahawa also. As a punishment for not being able to do so, the authority has been cancelling regular flights at the 11th hour.

161 including 77 foreigners climb Mount Manaslu this autumn,"Tuesday, November 1, 2022","Kathmandu, November 1
A total of 161 people have so far been successful to climb Mount Manaslu this autumn season.
According to the Department of Tourism, 77 foreigners and 84 Nepalis reached the top of Manaslu, measuring 8,163 metres in height.
The department’s Mountaineering Section Officer Bigyan Koirala says 407 foreigners acquired permission to scale the mountain, but only 77 made it. They were accompanied by Nepali Sherpa guides to the peak.
Now, the expedition to Mount Manaslu has been completed for the season while they are underway on other peaks.
The number of Manaslu climbers this time is relatively less than that in previous years. The area above the Manaslu base camp witnessed an avalanche just prior to the commencement of the Manaslu expedition this season.

Jost Kobusch and his obsession with climbing Everest solo,"Monday, October 31, 2022","Sick and alone in his tent, Jost Kobusch was having a torrid time awaiting good weather to climb Chulu West in the Annapurna region of western Nepal. It was raining constantly in early October 2022 and he did not know what was wrong with him. He had a fever that was not getting better and it resulted in him feeling extremely weak and easily exhausted.
But, not wanting to give up, he pushed himself as he broke the snow trail and stood atop Chulu West becoming the first person to climb the mountain solo.
“I thought a lot more people would have climbed it, but when I checked the Himalayan Database, I was surprised to see not many and climbed it and none had done it solo,” says Jost Kobusch in his hotel in Kathmandu.
He was climbing Chulu West to acclimatise for another project, but the fever, which later he found was dengue, and the irrational weather during the autumn meant he had to cancel the project and head back home. But, the alpinist, who has been coming to Nepal since 2014 says he has not finished as he aims to get back to Nepal to once again attempt to climb Mount Everest in the winter on a new route, alone.
“I go again in 2023,” he says.
Born in Bielefeld in Germany, Jost Kobusch grew up far away from the mountains, but when he joined a climbing group in his early teens, everything changed for the 30-year-old alpinist. He started with walls, then moved on to rocks and by the time he was 19, he set off to Kenya to climb Mount Kenya, the second-highest mountain in Africa.
He asked people to come with him, but no one wanted to join him so he hired a porter and a cook and set off to climb one of the most technical peaks in Africa.
“I soon realised how hard it was. It felt like I wasn’t ready for it and I wasn’t. I didn’t summit, but I learnt a valuable experience there – I didn’t need the porter or the cook and I could climb all on my own,” says Kobusch.
Following that, Jost Kobusch read many books on mountaineering. He was hooked. He wanted to do a lot more and started going to the alps to climb and train. During that time, he tried many projects, most of which, he says, he was not ready for.
“I went to Mont Blanc in the off-season to climb it alone. I was young and felt I could have done it but looking back now, I was at my limit and that is risky,” he says.
In 2014, aged 21, he came to Nepal to climb Ama Dablam. It was early in the season in spring and there was no one in the mountain. Alone and using all the training and skills gathered over the years, he climbed the technical mountain all on his own without any support. He reached the summit but realised how he had pushed himself to the limit yet again.
“This project got me a lot of recognition, but I’ll say that I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t a good alpinist at the time, but it did give me a good ego boost,” he says.
That kickstarted his career and Nepal then became another home for him. After climbing one Himalayan peak, he was hungry for more and tried to climb an 8000-er, Lhotse. But, seeing the crowd on the mountain was a big turn-off for someone who climbed mountains to get a sense of wilderness.
In 2016, Jost Kobusch came back to Nepal; this time his plan was Annapurna I, one of the most dangerous mountains in the world. After acclimatising on Lobuche East, he set off to climb Annapurna I.
“That mountain intimidated me. I realised the learn-or-die approach will not work. That mountain also taught me that the summit wasn’t important; it was just a bonus.”
As a rookie, he climbed the mountain without the help of supplemental oxygen. But, as there were people in the mountain, he felt he needed something wilder.
That experience came in the form of Nangpai Gosum II, a 7,296-metre peak near the Nepal-China border. He set off to climb the mountain alone and record the first ascent of what was then the highest unclimbed peak in Nepal.
For Jost Kobusch, that was a big moment. All his alpinism training came down to this. After reaching the summit, he was ecstatic. He knew he could now opt for different projects and climb them alone.
“I found out why I climbed. I felt I could figure things out on my own. It was then that I started to dream about climbing Everest alone via the West Ridge and doing so in the dead of winter,” he says.
But, before Everest, he needed to train more. He knew climbing alone gave him freedom like no other. He could climb with poise and take quick decisions without having the responsibilities of others.
“I had to learn to know my limits and keep my ego in check because if it exceeds a zone, everything becomes riskier.”
And, Jost Kobusch was afraid too.
For him, fear is a good thing as he feels it keeps you focused on the mountain. He believes that fear can be a rescue instrument when on the mountain as it can help get people out of some tense situations.
“We should ensure that fear doesn’t become our master,” he says. “It should always remain our servant and when we do that, we’ll be okay.”
But, that said, he does have self-doubt too. Sometimes what he has thought off does not go as planned and that causes a lot of issues.
Take Everest for that matter. Jost Kobusch has been on the mountain two times, but he has not reached the top. But, that does not mean he is going to give up. He believes if a person does not have self-doubt, he/she is not pushing hard enough.
“For me, it’s important I have that feeling because I am curious and like to do projects that people say can’t be done. This feeling excites me.”
Before taking on Everest in 2019, he came to Nepal and did different peaks. He did the first ascent of Amotsang Himal and also climbed Island Peak, Chulu Far East and Pachermo Peak. Feeling great, he felt fitter than ever to tackle Everest in the winter.
But, things did not go as planned. The winter was harsh and Jost Kobusch could only get to 7,329 metres.
“It was not easy. I don’t expect it to be, but I am doing something no one has done: climb Everest in winter without oxygen. Many may see it as a failure that I haven’t reached the summit but I don’t,” he says.
For him, each expedition is a learning experience and a chance to become a better alpinist. And, he says the past two expeditions on Everest have made him a better climber.
“Reaching the summit is not important for me. After all, it’s just a top of a meaningless rock covered with ice. What matters is giving meaning to the meaningless because, in the end, people will forget I did this in a few decades,” he says. “I’ve stopped caring what people think because that doesn’t matter anymore.”
Now as Jost Kobusch heads back to his home in Chamonix in France, he is sure to come back to and try Everest in 2023. Curious and hungry, he knows how tough it is going to be, but, the 30-year-old alpinist knows that by staying true to his style, working hard and with a small amount of luck, he can fulfil his dream of climbing Everest in a manner no one ever has.

Dhorpatan: Know all about Nepal’s only hunting destination,"Monday, October 31, 2022","Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is Nepal’s only hunting reserve. One can hunt animals here with a permit, at a specified time, in a specified area. It is a popular destination for foreign tourists who are fond of hunting.
The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation determines the hunting limit every year by counting and monitoring the wild animals there.
The reserve has 32 mammal species. It is also the shelter for 164 species of birds, many of which are rare and protected. The reserve is one of the prime habitats for blue sheep, a highly coveted trophy.
Other animals found here are leopard, goral, serow, Himalayan tahr, Himalayan black bear, barking deer, wild boar, rhesus macazue, langur and mouse hare. Endangered animals in the reserve include musk deer, wolf, red panda, cheer pheasant and danphe.
The hunting reserve is spread over the areas of Rukum, Baglung and Myagdi districts. The reserve has been divided into seven blocks for hunting, namely— Sundah, Seng, Dogadi, Barse, Phagune, Surtibang, Ghustung, and hunting arrangements are made accordingly.
Dhorpatan is blessed by nature; anyone can get enchanted by its beauty. During the rainy season, the seemingly endless landscape is covered with wildflowers. Seeing the horses grazing in that field feels like a canvas skillfully drawn by a painter. The weather here is also very strange. In a moment the sky opens up, and in a moment the clouds cover the land.
Dhor Barah Temple in Uttarganga Dhorpatan is a religiously famous pilgrimage site. Pilgrims gather here on various festivals including Janai Purnima, and Shivaratri.
Another attraction of the region is the Chyantung Monastery and a Tibetan settlement, three km east of the hunting reserve headquarters. If you are interested in the culture and lifestyle of Tibetan refugees here, you must reach Chyantung to do so.
There is no point in visiting Dhorpatan without experiencing Buki. After the onset of the rainy season, there is not enough grazing area for cattle. That is why the herders there go up to the lake driving their cattle before the rainy season. This is called “Buki Uklanu” in the local language.
Shepherds who go up to the lake in April return only in October. This journey can be an exciting opportunity to closely observe the Buki tradition and shepherd life.
Before entering the hunting reserve, it is better to visit the information centre and museum in the main office there.
No matter which season you visit, you find different flavours of nature here. If it is monsoon, you can see the beautiful view of horses grazing in the colourful valley. If it is autumn, you can climb the hills and see the beautiful Dhaulagiri, Gurja and Churen mountains. In winter, the beautiful fields are covered with snow, which looks even more attractive.
Homestays and hotels are operating in various villages in the area. Blue Sheep Hotel, Syaubari Thakali Kitchen, Community Hotel, Pankhathar Homestay etc provide organic food, hospitality and comfortable rooms. It is much better to inform them in advance if it is the peak tourist season.
The area is easily accessible from the main cities of the country— Kathmandu and Pokhara. From Pokhara, follow the Mid-Hill Highway to reach Burtibang. It takes five hours on bus, car or bike. Dhorpatan is 30 km from Burtibang. The journey along the unpaved road takes around two hours on an SUV or bike.

"CAAN takes action against NAC, Himalaya Airlines for not boarding flights from Bhairahawa","Sunday, October 30, 2022","Kathmandu, October 30
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has taken action against Nepal’s two international flight operators–Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) and Himalaya Airlines–for not carrying flights from and to the country’s second international airport, Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa.
The regulatory body has been forcing the flight companies to conduct flights from and to Bhairahawa as the new airport there has not seen the promising potential. Recently, Jazeera Airways has reduced the number of flights there. There are also reports that the airport does not have sufficient infrastructure to carry out international flights in an ample number.
But, just to increase the revenues, the authority, which also manages all airports in Nepal besides its regulatory work, has directed Nepal’s only two international flight carriers to shift some flights from Kathmandu to Bhairahawa in their winter-season schedule. But, as the companies did not abide by that, the authority cut down their flights in Kathmandu also.
CAAN Information Officer Gyanendra Bhul says three other international flight operators that carry more than three flights from the Kathmandu airport every day–Air Arabia, Fly Dubai and Qatar Airways–have been given a deadline of December 15 to shift some of their flights to Bhairahawa. He says if they fail to abide by the deadline, action will be taken against them also.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/caan-forces-nac-himalaya-bhairahawa.html,travel
Makalu base camp trek: Here’s the 9-day itinerary that made us feel the bliss,"Saturday, October 29, 2022","I had been meaning to travel to eastern Nepal for quite some time. But, every time I had planned, things had not worked out the way they should have. Even this year, I wanted to go to Kanchenjunga base camp, but fate took to me the Barun valley and the grandeur that is Makalu base camp.
As soon as I was given a two-week long holiday from work, I talked to a few friends from the travel industry and planned the trek to Makalu base camp. After all the planning was done, we left Kathmandu on September 21 by taking a flight to Biratnagar.
The next day, we took an SUV from Itahari to Khandbari and another SUV from Khandbari to Num from where our trek began as we ended the day at a small lodge in Chamla Kharka.
Here is the detailed itinerary that might be helpful for you to pursue the trail.
Knowing the trail to the Makalu base camp was hard. We started at 6 am. Our first stop was going to be Seduwa. Crossing the Arun river, we reached Seduwa at 9:30 am. After a plate full of dal-bhat, we left Seduwa, a place full of different ethnicities. While Chamla Kharka was a place full of Tamangs, Seduwa had Sherpas, Rais, Gurungs and Chhetris.
Seduwa is also the gateway to Makalu Barun National Park. After buying tickets to enter the national park and resting our full tummy, we began our journey to Tashi Gaun which would be our overnight stop for the day.
En route to Tashi Gaun, we walked past Mane Gaun and Chakse Danda. The trail is remote; not many people walk it. The phone network is non-existent as we were told only CDMA works in the region. Just as we left Mane Gaun, it also started to rain. But, we did not stop and persevered through reaching Tashi Gaun at 4 pm.
Tashi Gaun is the last settlement on the trek. From here onwards, there are only rest points and tea houses. After a warm meal, we discussed our plans for the next day and called it an early night.
It was another early start for us. By 6:30 am, we had already had our breakfast and were on our way first to Danda Kharka; the plan was to get to Khungma by dusk. The rain was showing no signs of retreat. It kept pouring and that meant the entire trail had leeches who, like the rain, decided to accompany us throughout the day.
Even if the leeches and the rain were not a problem, we had to cross a swollen river. It was fierce and loud and any mistakes on our part would mean catastrophe. But, we carefully negated the river and reached Danda Kharka around 9:30 am.
It was cold and a smiling Kipa Sherpa welcomed us to her lodge where she had lit a fire and was cooking lunch for us. She ran the lodge all on her own as her husband was in the Khumbu region working on the Cho Oyu expedition. It was shocking to see how she was not fazed at running the lodge all on her own. She also had to look after their three children.
After eating and resting for a while, Kipa gave us a plastic rain cover and we left hoping the rain would be kind to us. But, it did not and we reached Khungma around 3 pm. Khungma is a meadow at around 3,600 metres where people take their yaks, naks (female yaks), sheep and goats to graze. The land is also famous for red panda sightings.
The place only has three tea houses for trekkers. We stayed at Shiva Guest House where we were welcomed by Pasang Doma who even managed a heater for us to dry ourselves and our damp clothes.
We stayed around the warm kitchen talking with Pasang and porters who had plucked some mushrooms from the jungle, which was going to be our dinner for the night. I don’t know if it was the hunger or the wild mushroom, but it was the best mushroom curry I have had in my life. After the warm meal and drying ourselves, we called it a night.
Our eyes opened to the sound of rain outside. This was going to be a long day and the rain made us very lazy, but we braved the rain and set off from Khungma at our usual starting time of 6:30 am. As we walked on, the rain stopped, but the weather was horrible. It was cloudy and when we got to the viewpoint, an hour’s walk from Khungma, we did not see much. But, despite the poor weather, we took pictures and videos of the foggy mountain and started off again.
We reached Sanopokhari, 90 minutes walk from the viewpoint. I looked back and did not see my friends. I was a bit scared as I also could not see Sanopokhari. But as the clouds cleared, there was a small black pond in front of me. It felt like a large hole. It took me some time to figure out that it was a pond and not a hole.
After the rest of the group arrived, we moved towards Thulo Danda (or Siptonla Pass) where we would be having lunch. Thulo Danda is at around  4,200 metres and has a small tea house for trekkers to stop for lunch.
There, we met Dawa Sherpa, a guide who takes people to Shivadhara, a pilgrim sight in the Makalu-Barun region. After lunch, we set off towards Yangle Kharka and walked past Thulopokhari, which is reportedly four times the size of Sanopokhari. Surrounding Thulopokhari are huge mountains where locals come to collect yarsaghuma.
From there, we crossed another pass and descended around 1,000 metres and reached Dobate at 2 pm. The place has only one tea house, but it was closed, so we moved on and reached Jatey Odaar crossing another swollen river. Crossing a risky landslide area along the banks of the Barun river, we crossed it near Phemthang and reached Yangle Kharka at 5 pm. Once again, our clothes were damp due to the rain and after drying them and eating our dinner, we went to bed around 7:30 pm.
Our initial plan was to reach the Makalu base camp first and then climb to Shivadhara on our way back. But everyone told us that it was better to go to Shivadhara first, and we took their advice. That meant we needed to start earlier than we had been starting. So, after waking up at 5 am, we ate and by 5:30 am, we were out. We soon got to Neha Kharka and leaving our rucksacks at a small tea house there, we set off to climb the nearly 700-metre elevation to get to Shivadhara.
I have been to many places, but this trial to Shivadhara was simply crazy to walk on. Even thinking about it gives me goosebumps. There is one stretch where we have to walk on iron rods bolted on a cliff, known as via ferrata. My heart skipped a beat with every step on the rods. Braving the rods and knowing very well, we would have to cross it while descending, we slowly made our way to Shivadhara.
The weather was not the best, but when it did clear for a brief period, we got to see the grandeur of the Barun valley. I do not know if I will ever be able to forget this place. But, we could not stay long; we had to get to Nekha Kharka, eat and then head to Langmaale Kharka.
As soon as we left, a friend showed signs of altitude sickness. Not wanting to risk anything, we asked him to return to Neha Kharka. From here, it was just the two of us and walking at our own pace, we got to Langmaale Kharka. As we were sitting next to a heater, we were surprised to see our friend, who we had asked to stay at Neha Kharka, walk. Accompanying him was Dawa.
He told was how he had not walked all the way here to give up and after convincing us he could carry on, we had our dinner and went to bed.
That was the day we’d get to the Makalu base camp, but the day was going to be long and we got up really early and started walking at 4:30 am. As we would be coming back the same way, we left all the unnecessary items and walked towards the Makalu base camp with head torches on our foreheads. As the day broke at dawn, we got to see the misty view of Mount Tutse, also known as Peak Six.
The rain followed us almost every day, but this day, we were blessed with some good weather. By the time we reached the viewpoint in Merak near the Shersong Glacier, the weather cleared up, meaning we could finally see Makalu, the fifth-highest mountain in the world. It was like I saw something supernatural.
But, the Makalu base camp was still far away. We were nearly at 5,000 metres and the altitude was getting to us. Dawa said he had a headache and that was concerning as was the weather which we knew would turn against us anytime.
Slowly and steadily, we got to the Makalu base camp, also called Seto Pokhari. We got there at around 9:30 am and Makalu was straight in our faces. I do not have words to describe it, but I will say one thing, you have to get there to experience the grandeur of the pyramid-like mountain that is Makalu.
After nearly an hour at the Makalu base camp, we decided to move as Dawa’s headache was getting worse. Ditching the viewpoint, we decided to get back as soon as possible. We reached Langmale before noon and ate and started descending further. Our plan was to get to Phemathang, which was almost 1,200 metres below where we were. It was going to be a long walk down and we knew our knees would be shattered by the end of it. It was rainy and once again we were damp. After a long day, we were at Pemathang where we were going to stay the night.
There, we met a shepherd who told us of a recent bear attack in the area, which added to our worries as we also had to cross swollen rivers on the trail. But, that was tomorrow’s worry and not wanting to think about it, we ate and slept.
This was the hardest day on the Makalu base camp trail. We had to climb 1,000 metres and then descend 2,000 metres. We were praying that the weather would be kind to us along with the landslide area and the swollen river.
Crossing the river barefoot, we then started our ascent to Sipton Pass. Our plan was to eat Dobate for lunch, but the only place there was closed, which meant we had to walk on to Thulo Danda. Even though we did not get to eat, the view from Dobate was splendid. The green meadows were so pretty that it felt like someone had laid green carpet on the hill. Complementing this were many waterfalls coming from high above.
We got to Thulo Danda around noon. The first thing we did there was to call our families informing them we had made it to the Makalu base camp. We also ate a warm meal and after resting for a bit descended further. At Sano Pokhari, a friend even bought yarsagumba.
By the time we got to Danda Kharka, it was 4:30 pm.  We were tired. Keepa Sherpa, the same lodge owner, greeted us and wanted us to stay there. But, we wanted to get to Tashi Gaun and slowly made our way down. Keepa’s son was quite insistent and wanted us to stay, but disappointing the young boy, we left for Tashi Gaun, which we reached around 5:30 pm. We were exhausted from all the walking.
There we were told how fast we had walked. “You walked like locals,” said Tsering. We did not care for that. We were just happy we had made it to both Makalu base camp and Shivadhara and were back safely. Then, we just wanted to get back home and to our families.
It was the last day of walking and the sun was out. Happy, we started singing as we started walking from Tashi Gaun. Our minds were happy and hearts full. We did not care how much we needed to walk; we just kept going. We reached Seduwa around 9 am. After eating dal-bhat, we set off towards Num, from where we would take an SUV.
The trek to the Makalu base camp and back was almost over. While we had complained about the rain most of the trek, the heat of the sun was unbearable that day. The last SUV from Num leaves at 2 pm so we had to walk very fast. The humidity and the sun exhausted us as we reached Num at 3 pm. We were worried about not getting the ride down to Khandbari, but thankfully, we found a vehicle and reached Khandbari at 7 pm which meant our trek ended. Now, the only thing left was to head back to Kathmandu.
We had not taken a shower in over a week, so we got up real early and took a shower before we hopped on the SUV that would take us to Itahari. Crossing Tumlingtar, Leguwaghat, Pakhribas and Hile Bazaar, we crossed Dharan and reached Itaharai at around 1 pm.
From there, we got on an auto rikshaw and headed to the Biratnagar airport, from where we would fly to Kathmandu.
The Makalu base camp trek is one of the best trips I have ever had. Every time I thought about it, it brought a smile to my face. It had not been a day, and I was already missing the place. I missed the mountains, the rivers, the green meadows, and the ponds. I do not know about my friends, but I will remember this trip for years to come.
I know I will travel to other places soon, but this journey to the Makalu base camp, despite being hard, was amazing. You need to go to the mountains to really feel how I felt. So pack your backpacks because the mounts are calling us, and we must go.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/makalu-base-camp-trek-itinerary.html,travel
Nepal lifts paragliding ban after a week,"Sunday, October 23, 2022","Kathmandu, October 23
Exactly one week after imposing a blanket ban on paragliding flights across the country, the government has lifted the ban, claiming it will now introduce additional measures to ensure their safety.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) says it has set five conditions to ensure the safety of the flights. Here are the conditions:
The ban has been lifted following preliminary suggestions from a study team to suggest how to ensure safety in the flights of paragliders in Nepal, according to the authority’s deputy manager Binaya Giri.
After the death of a pilot in course of the ninth National Games in Pokhara last week, the government imposed a blanket ban on all paragliding activities in the country.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-lifts-paragliding-ban.html,travel
"Accountability question gets new height in Nepal tourism industry, to make revival tougher","Friday, October 21, 2022","As the Nepal tourism industry was heading towards a revival post-Covid, Luca Wagner came to the mountainous country in the first week of October to trek the Manaslu circuit. He had heard a lot about it and was excited to trek one of the raw trails in Nepal that not many do. But, things got tricky for the German who, on his way to Larke Pass, got stuck as the rain brought landslides in the region and blocked the trail.
“It was quite scary. Nothing happened, but things could have gone horribly wrong as we heard a Nepali died after getting caught in a landslide,” says Wagner who returned to Kathmandu without completing his trek, “I mean we had walked past different mudslides along the trail but managed to get to Samagaun safely. Trekking there, while it was raining, was a scary experience.”
The first week of October was chaotic for the Nepal tourism industry. The extended monsoon caused major issues in the tourism sector as people got caught in landslides, some went missing, and many were left stranded as rescue flights could not fly due to poor weather.
So far, three people (two Nepalis and one US citizen) have been reported dead due to this, but there are enough reasons to believe that lack of security measures has once again put the lives of Nepali guides and international trekkers at risk. In spite of the risks, people were allowed to trek in regions which have seen some major disasters in the past killing a number of people. With neither the trekking companies nor government regulators taking accountability for this, there are questions if the Nepal tourism industry is ready to host millions of tourists every year.
Things were the same around the Annapurna Circut as tourists trying to cross the Thorong Pass had a hard time as they could not find the footrail. This, for Deepak Gurung, a trekking guide, brought back bad memories of 2014 when a blizzard in Manang and Mustang killed over 30 people, mostly on the 5,416-metre pass.
“There were flashbacks as it was snowing heavily in Manang. I decided to not go further because it was too risky. Some groups went ahead and were lucky to make it out alive,” says Gurung.
A similar issue plagued tourists trekking in Dopla, an emerging destination in the Nepal tourism industry. Over 100 trekkers in the region are believed to have been affected by rain as flash floods and landslides across the region made trekking very hard and in some areas impossible.
Ram Parajuli, a porter, says that in some areas, the flash floods were so fierce that they had to return to the same spot they spent the night before.
“It was scary. There was no way we could have crossed it. The risk of landslides was huge too; I’m not surprised people went missing there,” he says.
The Himalayan Times reported that at least eight French tourists went out of contact in the Upper Dolpa region after they faced adverse weather conditions. Some were rescued, but most are still around the area.
Major patrons of the Nepal tourism industry come to Nepal to trek the remote areas and have a set itinerary. These people do not want to miss out on even a day as they do not want to miss their flight back home. But, in cases of emergencies, even though their trekking companies advise them not to go, many go on taking risks.
“These people come here for a specific time and because they are here for a specific purpose, trekking in the mountains, they go despite the risks,” says Nilhari Bastola, the president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN).
Bastola agrees that the Nepal tourism sector has not learnt from past mistakes, but, right now, when the industry has only just kick-started after the coronavirus pandemic, it would have been impossible to tell people “don’t go.”
“We have failed to give other alternatives. We should have told people don’t go to Manalsu or Dolpa or Everest and go instead to Langtang or Gosaikunda or other areas that were safe to travel, but we couldn’t and that has been a failure on our part,” says Bastola.
He says that in future, all trekking companies active in the Nepal tourism industry should do so as most mountain areas in the country do not have phone networks or internet and that causes a lot of issues when disaster hits. That said, he also calls on the government to help when there are disasters.
“These people have bought permits from the government to get to these places. We feel it’s important that the government becomes a little more proactive to help find and rescue tourists stuck in remote areas,” he says.
He says that the businesses had to seek help from the police to locate 11 tourists who went out of contact in Dhorpatan earlier this month after the Nepal Tourism Board and other authorities did not help.
“The police from East Rukum helped and we were able to locate the people. Thankfully all of them were safe,” he says.
The Tourist Police under the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation says it did a lot of help find stranded tourists and missing ones but says the entire system needs to change for the Nepal tourism industry to get better.
“We do our bit, but when we don’t get information on how many tourists have come to the country and gone trekking to which area we can’t do much,” says inspector Chandra Kishor Shah, the spokesperson of Tourist Police.
He says issues like what happened in the first week of October will continue to happen if the government does not take the Nepal tourism industry seriously. He says a lack of professionalism and accountability in the sector is doing a lot of harm.
Officials at the Tourism Ministry agree. They say that the Tourism Act needs a major review before the country can celebrate the Visit Nepal Decade.
“Our Tourism Act is too old. We need to ensure it is reviewed,” says an official who wants to remain anonymous. “We want to celebrate the tourism decade, but we can’t even guarantee their safety.”
“This needs to be reviewed and everyone involved in the Nepal tourism industry should be held accountable because right now no one wants to take the blame even though everyone is at fault.”
Another issue that the Nepal tourism sector faced this year was the flight to remote areas. Everest is the country’s crown jewel when it comes to trekking. It is the goose that lays the golden egg, but since flights to Lukla got halted for over a week due to poor visibility and rain, 2,000 tourists were affected.
After the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN)‘s recent decision, all flights to Lukla operate from the Manthali airport in Ramechhap, some 130 km away. As Manthali does not have enough lodges to cater to the tourists, there were a lot of issues.
Packed lodges meant a lot of people wanting to travel to Everest had to either adjust themselves in Manthali or return to Kathmandu. Some restored to hiking to Lukla from Manthali itself.
A few, however, took SUVs to Khari Khola, a day’s trek away from Lukla. But, the SUV which usually costs Rs 16,000 was charging tourists over Rs 50,000.
“This is very wrong. It feels like we’re overcharged and cheated everywhere we go. We paid Rs 30,000 for a jeep ride which I was then told was cheap, but when we got to Lukla, we were told how we paid twice the amount,” says Jason Clarke from Australia.
TAAN president Bastola feels this is wrong and that the government should monitor such activities in the Nepal tourism industry more effectively.
“Over 1,000 people were stranded there. There’s nothing there and many complained that they had to stay in their rooms bored. Had they been in Kathmandu, they could have engaged themselves in Kathmandu or chosen to go somewhere else,” says Bastola.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tourism-lack-accountability.html,travel
"After blanket ban, govt commissions team to suggest how to ensure paragliding safety","Wednesday, October 19, 2022","Kathmandu, October 19
The government has established a high-level study team to suggest how to ensure paragliding safety in Nepal.
The move comes days after the death of a paragliding pilot in course of the ninth National Games currently underway in Pokhara. Following the accident, the government has imposed a blanket ban on all paragliding activities in the country.
But, now, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has established a team to ensure how to ensure paragliding safety.
The authority’s deputy director-general Hansa Raj Pandey leads the team. It has representatives from the Nepal Airsports Association, the National Sports Council and other related fields including medicine.
The authority’s spokesperson Jagannath Niraula says the committee has been instructed to submit its report as soon as possible, adding the ban will continue until a decision is made as suggested by the committee.
Commercial paragliding as an adventurous sports activity for tourists began in Nepal in 1996. In these 26 years, Nepal has witnessed 17 big paragliding incidents, costing the lives of 17 people.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/paragliding-safety-study-team.html,travel

Citing a lack of sufficient passengers, Kuwaiti Jazeera Airways has reduced the number of flights from and to  Gautam Buddha International Airport (aka Bhairahara airport), Nepal’s 2nd international airport.
The company began daily flights on September 16 only. Previously, the company was conducting three flights between Bhairahawa and Kuwait City every week.

The authority’s spokesperson Gyanendra Bhul says Jazeera Airways has informed the authority that it will keep on changing the flight schedule based on the availability of passengers.
As most of the Nepalis flying to Kuwait are migrant workers, a lack of medical examinations and labour approval facilities for them in Bhairahawa resulted in the flight cut, according to him.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/jazeera-airways-no-daily-bhairahawa.html,travel

Annapurna base camp trek: A solo traveller’s suffering and solace,"Saturday, October 15, 2022","It was almost midnight at Annapurna base camp. The rain was pouring down. I could hear the raindrops hitting the roof over my head with the occasional thunder. The weather was awful it had rained all day and the forecast suggested the same for the night.
This was something I hadn’t taken into consideration as I’d trekked the trail to Annapurna base camp, popularly known as ABC, alone to see the first rays of the sun on Annapurna I. But, as I woke up around midnight, I knew there was no certainty of that and hoped that the mountain would be kind enough to show itself in all its glory.
My morning alarm went off at 5:30 on a fine October morning. Anxious and scared, I got out. I could still hear drops of water falling on the ground. There were murmurs outside – both positive and negative. It was dark and misty and there weren’t many people out. This was bad as it meant that the clouds hadn’t cleared up.
But, the reality was different. The mountains had cleared up, but not as much as I’d hoped for. Annapurna I was playing hide and seek as it was shrouded in mist and clouds as were Annapurna South, Bahra Shikhar and Singu Chuli. It wasn’t the best of mornings, but waking up early was still worth it.
Even though the mountains hadn’t cleared up, there was something different about the morning. The air was crisp. I was 4,000 metres above sea level and I wasn’t breathless. There was something positive about the place. And when the sun started to rise from above the Machhapuchchhre, it started to make sense why.
The sun helped clear the mist away, and slowly, one by one, the mountains started to clear up. First was Annapurna I, the tenth-highest mountain in the world. The mountain is huge. Fierce and steep, I just wanted to keep looking at it, maybe even climb it. It was daunting but the mountain kept pulling me towards it.
Others rushed to the viewpoint at Annapurna base camp to take pictures with the Annapurnas in the backdrop. Some stood there in the viewpoint, just looking around. Taking it all in like me as they had certain happiness to be so close to the mountains. It felt like this was their happy place.
Annapurna base camp is beautiful. It probably is the most beautiful base camp in the whole of Nepal if not the world. It’s got every bit of everything: mountains, jungle, rivers and waterfall. Each day, the scenery changes and getting lost in these sceneries, I felt I found myself a bit. The trial was testing, but the people I met on the trail along with the different scenarios that happened, I believe, made me stronger, not just physically, but mentally.
I decided to go to ABC after a lot of thinking. The plan was to go to Langtang from Sundarijal via Gosainkunda. This 10-day trip was going to be one of the toughest treks I’d have done. But, as the days neared, no one wanted to go with me and not wanting to cross the high passes alone, I choose something more doable alone. That’s when ABC came in as I knew it would have a lot of trekkers and also because the Annapurna sanctuary as it is known is one the prettiest places in the world.
I took an early morning flight to Pokhara and before I knew it, I was starring at a steep uphill climb from Jhinu Danda to Chhomrong. Trust me when I say this, climbing that uphill with the sun right on my face was one of the toughest things ever. I even contemplated if I should just head down, go to the hot spring and just chill a few days doing nothing but reading books I’d brought along. But, I didn’t do that, and slowly climbed up taking rests whenever I wanted to.
The first hour was not easy, but soon, the view started to get better as I climbed up. That reminded me why I go trekking. The answer was simple: to be at one with nature, to escape life in the city and moreover to find me by putting myself in uncomfortable situations.
After two hours of slow walking, Chhomorng was in front of me, a bustling village full of hotels and lodges for trekkers. The place had it all, some bars and even a bakery that sold cheesecakes. It reminded me of Namche Bazaar. Well, it wasn’t as good but still quite busy and huge.
Contemplating if I wanted to walk further, I stopped, grabbed a few beers and watched Annapurna South, Hiuchuli and Machapucchre play hide and seek with me.
The evening was great. People were returning from Annapurna base camp with bright smiles on their faces. Most of them were tanned and were limping, but they had fun and that was the most important aspect of trekking in the mountains.
The next day was going to be the toughest. I hate downhills. I feel it’s one of the most testing parts of trekking. I’ve been clumsy while going downhill and when I started the day, I immediately tweaked something on my knee. I thought it was going to be something minor but would only find out its effect later on.
From Chhomrong, the train goes down to a suspension bridge which only means one thing, a climb up. This climb up wasn’t as hard as the one from Jhinu to Chomrong, but with the sun on my face, it wasn’t easy. Huffing and puffing, hydrating and telling Miguel, a fellow solo trekker from Spain, about Nepal, I got to Upper Sinuwa in around two hours.
The hills soon disappeared as the trail to Annapurna base camp moved into the jungle. There was silence as the only noise I could hear was that of my own footsteps and those of birds and insects. The wind was quite calming as was the trail, probably the easiest. I couldn’t help but feel free, freer than the family of langurs I saw along the way.
Soon after a few hours’ walk, I was in Bamboo, a place known for its bamboo trees and well the sloth bear. The weather had changed by then. The clouds had come in. It was only 2 pm, but it started to get dark. Miguel wanted me to walk with him, but I was on a solo trek, I didn’t want to walk with anybody.
Then, it started to rain, not heavy but still enough to make you want to not walk. I wanted to stay, but it was too early to call it a day so I walked.
Alone in the jungle in the rain, I started to feel a little anxious. The trail to Dovan wasn’t long, but it felt a lot. The weather was not getting any better; the rain started to get heavier. A part of me asked myself again why I was doing this.
This wasn’t fun. Don’t take me wrongly, I love rain but walking in the rain on a trail like that was not fun. But, it had to be walked and rather than complaining, I walked on and go to Dovan before it started to rain like cats and dogs.
There, I met Kengi, a 72-year-old Japanese, who was also trekking to Annapurna base camp alone. He left his home in Japan three years ago and was travelling the world since. An interesting man, but as he started to drink alcohol made from kodo (millet), he turned into someone from my family who keeps telling me to get married.
Kengi, Miguel and I talked a lot… about love, life and growing old. The wise heads were shocked I was reading Albert Camus’ Happy Death, after which we started to discuss what happiness meant.
After some time, we agreed to disagree that happiness was just a phase and that our trekking to Annapurna base camp was happiness. Drinking to that, Kengi and I jokingly decided to race to Machhapurchre base camp.
The trail from Dovan onwards was mostly uphill. Walking early in the morning was refreshing. I realised how I walked faster in the morning than after the sun came out. The forest was calm, but the constant sound of water was everywhere. Small rivulets and waterfalls were a constant and all of the mixtures in the Modi river down below were loud. On the way to the Himalaya, there is a small shrine opposite a waterfall that has around 108 small waterfalls within it.
This waterfall seemed interesting and pretty, but sadly, there was no vantage point to get to see it better, still, a nice place to stop and relax amidst prayer flags and shrines. It felt like a great place to meditate or just sit down and write. The place was calming. There was no one. Not a soul. I felt as free as I’d ever felt.
Soon, the sun was up and the uphill started to get steeper. Once out of the Himalaya, the forest finished and I was walking on a trail between two massive hills with the rumbling sound of the Modi river. These hills were huge probably higher than 4,000 metres. Most of them were covered in clouds, but they looked grand as some of them had waterfalls coming out from them.
It was like I was in a movie about Switzerland or something. I’d heard a lot about the Annapurna sanctuary since my first trek around some Gurung villages lower down, but seeing some of these places made me think how Nepal hadn’t taken advantage of these places even in the decade gone by.
Now, the trail to Annapurna base camp started to move upwards over 3,000 metres. That meant the air got thinner. There were shrubs around, but locals said most of them were wildflowers that released poison and that meant climbing was harder. Machhapuchhre base camp (MBC) isn’t that far from Deurali, but climbing an uphill at above 3,000 metres isn’t fun.
You think a lot, you breathe a lot and you walk a lot less. It was hard but I knew that it was going to be all worth it. Walking alone, I was passed by one group after another, which was a bit discouraging, but I kept on motivating myself. I knew I could do it and I did as I reached MBC when the entire place was covered in mist.
MBC is set on a nice meadow opposite Machapuchhre and Gangapurna among other mountains. It’s not the best place for views, but many stay here the night before heading up to Annapurna base camp as many don’t want to sleep. I decided to stay at MBC and ABC both. I didn’t have anyone to tell me otherwise. The place was nice and quiet and did offer some good views of Machapuchhre and the valley below.
The weather in the evening was sketchy as the clouds completely covered the small valley. It affected visibility, but at night the winds calmed down and the weather was perfect as there was not a single cloud in the sky. The galaxy was clearly visible and it even treated me to a few shooting stars.
The morning was equally good. The mountains were clear. The Annapurnas to the west looked like something else as the sun slowly rose up. It felt like a bad decision not to have walked up to ABC in the morning, but I had fun walking up this amazing ridgeline at MBC alone watching the sunrise.
The walk up to ABC from MBC was easy. Altitude didn’t help with pace, but the walk was smooth. There was plenty of sheep in the green meadows. To the left was the Modi river flowing independently. The air was getting crispier and the mountains were getting closer.
Describing the walk up to Annapurna base camp is hard. A lot of thoughts were going on in my mind. After my solo trek to Everest base camp in April 2021, I didn’t think I’d do another one alone. But, I did. And this tested me more than EBC did. I felt happy I’d made it. I met Miguel on the way up who was just as happy I had made it; he knew I’d been suffering from knee issues on our walk down from Chhomrong. But, I’d made it. Annapurna base camp aka ABC, the crown jewel of the Annapurnas…
The walk down from Annapurna base camp was harder than I thought. I had practised running downhill, but I didn’t know my knee issues would get worse. I could barely bend my left knee, which meant every step had to be taken with the right.
I was very angry and disappointed in myself. I was in pain and I had no choice but to move on. The first two hours were not hard, but once I crossed Deurali, the pain became unbearable. A couple from the Netherlands gave me some instant pain relief lotion, which helped a bit but the knee wasn’t going to get better until I rested.
What didn’t help was the rain. The clouds had come in and it started to rain. The trail, which was mostly rocky steps, became slippery. I didn’t have much balance due to the leg and nearly fell multiple times. It was hard, not just physically but mentally. At this point, I regretted coming alone but regretting wasn’t going to get me home. The only person that could get me home was me and I had to push myself mentally more than physically to get to the Himalaya where I decided to stop. It was only 1 pm, but I could barely move my knee and decided to not push no more.
As I say outside the lodge in Himalaya, all I could think about was how the porters did what they did. Most carried more than 20 kgs on their back even though legally they are only allowed 16 kgs. Yet they did it, with a smile on their face. Their life is hard. They get around 15 USD a day, which they barely save but still persevere.
The next day, the knee got a little better, but I had to walk at least eight hours to get to Chomrong, which I had told myself I would walk to. I started off early and walked the forests alone. Walking the forests where they say there are sloth bears is a bit scary, but there was no choice. If I was to be killed by a bear during my trek to Annapurna base camp, I wouldn’t have cared.
I’d walked the trail when it was raining and had missed out on the scenery of the forest. This time, as I walked slow, I could hear the forest better. The sun pierced through the trees lighting up parts of the forest. Small waterfalls in different parts of it, added beauty to the trail. I think people who walk this trail swiftly will miss out on these little details. I mean I saw so many birds, some species I had never seen. In one corner, I even saw two blue sheep that ran uphill as soon as they saw me.
My leg hurt, but my mind was healthy. I’d stressed a lot the day before, but when I started to walk, I felt free from all the pain. I was focused and determined to get to Chomrong. The trail once again went uphill and downhill. It felt like it was teaching me a lesson that life is full of ups and downs and that is when the quote from the book Into the Wild struck me.
The book quoted Christopher McCandless on how important it is, in life, not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, and to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions.
And this trek felt like a test. It tested me mentally and physically. I think I found myself in the trek and found my limits. But, will I trek alone again? Well, I don’t think I will, but time will tell.

Mundhum trail in eastern Nepal: Not for the faint-hearted or the weak,"Saturday, October 8, 2022","I ended up trekking the Mundhum trail by chance. The route had been on my bucket list for quite some time, but circumstances were not in my favour. When the chance came to trek one of the 10 most beautiful trekking trails in Nepal, I was not going to let it slip.
This trail has a history surrounding it, a certain ritual too. The trail holds a special place in the hearts of Kirats. It has got pretty much everything: a neat trail, an amazing ridgeline and some beautiful ponds and lakes. But, mind it, it is not for the faint-hearted people.
I’d heard so much about the Mundhum trail. But, every time I planned, something or the other did not add up as my dream of trekking there remained that – a dream.
In early September, when my friend Nabin Rai asked me to join him on a journey to Salpa Pokhari along the Mundhum trail, I was once again disappointed. He told me how he was accompanying a new shaman from Lamakhu and asked me to join him. But, due to other commitments, I couldn’t go.
A week later, Yugsan Kirat called to tell me how great the new shaman was.
“He can cut ginger with his bare hands. A friend has even shot a video of him doing that,” Yugsan told me.
That was it. I had to go see this for myself. I asked if Yugsan wanted to do and when he agreed, I set off to get lost in the Mundhum trail.
The journey started on September 16. I and singer and composer Dipesh, Nabin and Karna would join the shaman up to the pond. Yugsan sadly couldn’t join us as his daughter fell ill.
When we reached Lamakhu, we were told around 30 people had already started the hike up with the new shaman, Chandra Kumar Rai. After a brief rest, we too set off to go to Salpa and Silichung.
We were hiking up a trail from the below Sapsudhap. The forest trail was quite amazing but just as we started the hike up, it started to rain. As Sapsu temple got closer, the rain started to pour down. We tried to take shelter under a tree, but my ‘high-quality shoes’ slipped and I fell down.
I tried to grab a bush, but the weak shrubs couldn’t hold on to my weight as I fell quite badly. I was hurt but I persevered and met Nabin and Karna at a rest stop near Sapsu temple.
It was still raining and we were worried if the rain would subside. Usually, the rain in the mountains doesn’t stop, but it did. And with that, we set off climbing.
After walking downhill for a short period, we reached a cave. We felt cold and Nabin set up a small fire in the cave. We ate some baked corn and some local liquor we’d carried with us. We were tired so we kept quiet, ate drank and wondered when we would reach our destination.
The Mundhum trail starts on the border of Khotang and Bhojpur districts in Province 1 from Chakhewa Bhanjyang. But, we didn’t start from there, we joined the trail from Dalsinghe, some six kilometres uphill from Chakhewa Bhanjyang.
It was drizzling constantly and the dense fog didn’t help us either. But, we didn’t stop as the trail kept surprising us with things I personally hadn’t seen before. Old Kirat rest points and ponds in the shape of bows and wasofungwa mesmerised us along the way.
It soon became dark, but the moonlight helped us on the mystic Mundhum trail. We stopped to admire the gleaming town of Bhojpur, took a sip of alcohol and smoked a cigarette each and walked on.
As the evening turned into night, we reached Ghodre Deurali, around 2,750 metres above sea level. Milan, who was ahead of us, had arranged a camp for us to stay the night at. We freshened up, changed our clothes and sat by the fire eating dal-bhat.
After deciding who would sleep on the bed and in the sheds, and some fun and games, we called it a night.
When I woke up in the morning, I was once again reminded of my snoring. A while ago, on a trip to Ghandruk, I was judged the king of snoring. And, in the morning, a few people told me how my constant snoring didn’t let them sleep.
The shaman’s team headed up first. We tried to follow them, but we fell behind the team quite early. Those who had left the camp after us also caught up with us and our group got larger.
A few of them had been to Salpa before. Some had been there four times before. When asked why they loved going there, one replied that going to Salpa would improve health and that their wishes would come true.
On the full moon in December, many devotees gather around Salpa Pokhari, a popular point along the Mundhum trail. Shamans from different ethnic groups assemble there as they believe they gain supernatural powers in the place.
After a few hours’ walk from Ghodre, where we’d spent the night, we reached Has Pokhari in Maiyung. A group had stelled down to cook food, but we wanted to carry on.
Just as we passed a group, they asked us to stop and told us how the trail forward was confusing and that we might get lost. They even offered us food but as our group had already set off ahead, we didn’t want to waste time and ventured ahead.
“Go straight, you’ll find a pod then head left,” an old lady told us.
We climbed up and quickly realised what she meant. There are no trail marks and the chance of getting lost was quite high.
And, that is what happened. We got lost, and then, we had no idea what to do.
We tried calling people, but there was no phone network. We had no choice but to walk ahead and soon we reached a pond where we got a phone network. We called people and asked where to go. They told us we should head down from the pond from where we’d join the trail.
Maiyung has lots of ponds and there are downhill paths everywhere. We did take one downhill, but we never found the exact Mundhum trail. We saw a shed and some horses nearby and hoped someone would be there. But, the shed was empty.
It started to rain. So, we climbed up again and reached a vantage point from where we saw a trail. We were certain that we’d meet some on the main road and walked down. It was 1:30 pm. We had been lost for three hours.
The terrain of Maiyung is wide. The rolling hills didn’t help. We climbed one hill hoping that it would connect to another, but the trail would go straight down which discouraged us a lot.
We were tired and were sitting by a roadside when suddenly we saw a man. When we asked if we were on the correct trail to Salpa, he told us we weren’t and asked us to follow him.
We were hungry and it was raining constantly. We could barely move. Knowing we were so far from the Mundum trail was discouraging.
“Elders used to tell me don’t discard a warm meal but we did and look where it got it,” Nabin said.
It was funny but sad at the same time. We felt discouraged and that is when we asked the guy to help us find shelter for the night.
Nabin even asked him to go forward and tell our friends to come and get us. And, he did just that as he rushed ahead and came back to help us with others who were waiting for us.
His efforts were invaluable to us. We couldn’t have asked for anything better. We were exhausted and finally caught up with our Mundhum trail team.
As soon as we reached the camp, we were given a warm noodle soup which we felt brought us back to life.
But, soon reality struck us. We knew it would rain all day again. We didn’t have anything dry to wear. Our legs were shattered and we knew we needed to walk two more days to reach the destination.
I and Dipesh felt we couldn’t go on. We told Nabin who wasn’t happy about it, but he understood. A few elders from the group told us to carry on but we had made up our minds. The group left for Salpa and we headed back from where we came from.
We reached Home Stay Number One around six in the evening. We were there for around 33 hours and during that time, it rained constantly. Tucked in our blankets, we wondered how the group that went ahead was doing.
But there was nothing we could do. All we could do was hope they were okay. We couldn’t make it to Salpa-Silichung. We were disappointed but that said, our journey along the Mundhum trail is something we will never forget.

9 medicines to carry during your travel to Nepal,"Saturday, October 8, 2022","Many travellers around the world keep Nepal on their bucket list of must-visit destinations. But, your travel to Nepal or any of the new destinations means you might encounter a new environment, different stimuli and organisms; that might cause you to fall sick. So, to fully experience Nepal on your visit, you need to take precautions to keep yourself safe and healthy.
For this, you need to carry some medicines with you and here we recommend some that will help you during your travel to Nepal. [Note: This excludes the round of annual vaccines you take, vaccines recommended by your country before travelling and compulsory Covid vaccines.]
Many ailments and sicknesses are easy to solve with a pill or two. So if you are travelling and you want to avoid falling sick or cure your ailments quickly, you should carry some over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (paracetamol/Flexon), ibuprofen (Brufen/Advil) that you can use as painkillers or a pill to relieve yourself from fever.
Other OTC medicines can be antibiotics like azithromycin and ciprofloxacin or liquid enzymes like Aristozyme and even Digene tablets or liquids for any digestive or gastronomic issues. Since travellers have different palettes; you might likely face some issues while having food on the go.
Like food, water too can give you some unwanted ailments and digestive problems. So, if you want to travel to Nepal and will be on the road for the major part of your travel, carry some halazone iodine (Tetraglycine Hydroperiodide), chlorine (Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate), chlorine di-iodide tablets to avoid water-borne or water-related diseases. At the very least, you do not have to worry about drinking unhygienic and contaminated water.
If you are a foreigner during your travel to Nepal, you might encounter some allergies either because of dust or pollens. For this, if you carry OTC antihistamine medicines like Brompheniramine (Dimetane) Cetirizine (Zyrtec) Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) that treat symptoms such as itchy and watery eyes, runny nose, hives, hay fever, conjunctivitis and reactions to insect bites or stings.
Other OTC medications that you can carry during your travel to Nepal for cough, cold or nasal congestions are Aleve, Tylenol, and Nyquil among others. You can carry some spray or balms, vapour rubs and even sancho, a multi-purpose local herbal essential oil.
Carrying a first aid kit with you can be very helpful not only during your travel to Nepal. Not every wound or pain has to be checked by medical professionals in a hospital. Also, first aid kits are to give your immediate attention to your ailment and minimise the injury or pain.
For this, you can carry a small kit with you including some adhesive bandages, gauges, cotton, crepes, band-aids, and pain sprays for your injury or ankle sprains are common while trekking and hiking.
Nepal is famous for its mountains, so if you travel to Nepal for trekking or mountain climbing, make sure that you also carry Acetazolamide or Diamox tablets with you. Since the mountains are at a significant altitude that you might not be familiar with, you might develop (acute) altitude sickness while trekking beyond 3500 m above sea level. It is not a guarantee but you can take measures to avoid it from your side.
Nepal reports infrequent cases of dengue, malaria and even encephalitis. If you do not want to fall sick during your travel to Nepal because of mosquito bites, you need to take precautions.
Apart from this, Nepal is home to many insects and pests that you might not be familiar with. A bite or contact with the insects might leave you sick. So do carry some insect repellent creams like Ultrathon, Picaridin and Odomos to prevent getting malaria and dengue.
It is not a medicinal choice. However, you are exposing yourself to the sun even more during your travel to Nepal. The more you climb up, the more vulnerable will you be to the ultraviolet rays. The harsh sunrays can leave you with sunburns at the very least. So carry sunscreen with you with at least SPF 30+ and UV ray protection glasses if necessary.
Also if you are travelling to the plains of Nepal, then you will also need sunscreen to protect yourself from the harsh weather and exposure to the sun.
Apart from all these recommended ones, if you are suffering from any kind of health condition for the time being or long term, please make sure to carry your regular prescribed medicines or any other medical equipment you might need on a daily or regular basis during your entire travel to Nepal. DO NOT leave it up to the chance to get the medicines in (remote) Nepal.
Take care, carry your medicines and travel safely.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/health-medicines-for-travel-to-nepal.html,travel

"One dead, multiple injured after avalanche hits Manaslu","Monday, September 26, 2022","Kathmandu, September 26
An avalanche on Manaslu killed one and injured multiple climbers on Monday.
According to reports from base camp and those reported by The Himalayan Times and Everest Chronicle, over a dozen people have been injured after an avalanche ripped through just below camp 4.
Mingma Dorchi Sherpa from Pioneer Adventures from base camp says one person died on the mountain and around five are in a critical state.
“Weather around base camp is very bad, too cloudy to send helicopters to the higher camp. We are waiting for the weather to get better,” he said.

Kathmandu halts Lukla flights again; travellers need to go to Manthali to fly to Everest,"Friday, September 23, 2022","Kathmandu, September 23
Nepal’s civil aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), says Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will stop operating Lukla flights that passengers use to reach the Everest region.
From now onwards, all flights will operate from the Manthali airport in Ramechhap, some 130 km away. Tourists and others based in Kathmandu, willing to fly to Lukla’s Tenzing Hillary Airport, will have to travel to Manthali via road, and it will take some five hours.
This rule meant to decrease the traffic pressure at Kathmandu airport was in existence before the Covid pandemic, but it was halted due to difficulties in maintaining travel restrictions required for the pandemic control.

LaMa Walks: Aspiration to take Nepal’s trekking culture to another height through education,"Wednesday, September 14, 2022","Similar to thousands of youth in the country, Lama (not disclosing his first name citing his personal choice), the founder of LaMa Walks, also had a dream to become a British Army soldier. But, he was rejected in the selection process.
To compensate for the loss of rejection, he began searching for a job. Lama first worked at a call centre but he could not enjoy it and left the job.
Then in 2009, he found some work at a trekking company, which he claims changed his life eventually. Having learned about trekking expeditions, he started touring and trekking on his own. This job offered him happiness and excitement besides money. With time, trekking became his obsession, which led to the establishment of LaMa Walks, a company that aspires to take the country’s trekking industry to a new height by educating people about this.
LaMa Walks is unlike many other hundreds of trekking companies working in Nepal. It stands out because it not only provides the service of trekking and expedition but also renders the service of outdoor education, specifically known as the Outdoor Learning Programme (OLP), for school and college students, informs Lama.
There are only a handful of trekking companies that actively run this education programme, but it has been a flagship programme of LaMa Walks since its establishment in 2014.
The OLP includes a collection of courses that includes theoretical and practical lessons focused on trekking and expedition. The course includes lessons ranging from walking style to waste management, respecting wildlife and first aid treatment.
To date, LaMa Walks has provided customised courses to a number of academic institutions including Little Angels, Gyanodaya School, GEMS School and more. The course has various packages, lasting from one night-two days to 14 days.
Besides, in the last eight years since its establishment, LaMa Walks has served over 100 clients. Lama says most of them are foreigners.
Lama says the education programme has remarkably changed the students’ attitudes regarding trekking. “When they first join the course, they take the trekking course lightly, just as a source of fun. But once they complete it, they realise its hardships and challenges,” he says.
In the practical session, the students need to do everything on their own, from pitching a tent to cooking food. The people who would otherwise rely on family for everything also realise the struggle of being self-reliant.
While this educational programme is progressive and effective, it also has challenges. As a result, there are very few institutions to host this programme. “Since the programme includes children, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea to understand their psychology,” Lama says.
“Sometimes they might cry during the journey, and it could be difficult to control them,” Lama says he has a team of experts who could work in any difficult situation.
But, as he is determined to make an impact on the new generation, Lama has now resorted to popular social media platforms. The TikTok account of LaMa Walks has over 10,000 followers. There, the company provides helpful information to trekking enthusiasts.
On TikTok and elsewhere, Lama is happy to see the number of Nepalis getting interested in trekking growing. He says in the last few years, the number of domestic trekkers has been increasing exceptionally. “With the growing number of local trekkers, the number of trekking companies is also increasing, but that is not something we should feel happy about,” he says, adding the companies first should make themselves “educated” about trekking.
Otherwise, the industry becomes unprofessional, making the clients suffer, he warns.
He hopes the concerned authority will work on making proper policies to encourage “authentic” trekking companies.
Lama, also a mountaineer who has climbed Mt Manaslu and Island peak, is determined to promote trekking culture all around the country.
To quench this thirst, he has taken some other initiatives too. Lama owns another company closely connected to trekking. Himalayan Medics provides first aid training for trekkers, and the idea is known as wilderness first aid.
The training is conducted four times a year and in one session, around 25 people are enrolled.
For the last four years, LaMa Walks has been providing climbing sponsorship at Kathmandu Sport Climbing Centre and Astrek Climbing Wall for anyone aged between 14 to 25 years. Likewise, it has also been sponsoring athlete Swastika Chaudhary.
Lama says he has got a surfeit of other ideas. One among them is to host a travel award, that is to say, sponsoring some best trekking plans.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lama-walks-nepal-trekking-education.html,travel
Destination Sailung: Here’s what you should know before your visit,"Tuesday, September 13, 2022","If you want to experience what the horizon looks like, Sailung, quite close to Kathmandu, is your perfect destination for trekking.
In the winter, you can enjoy the snow here as the place located on the border of Dolakaha and Ramechhap is 3,150 metres high from sea level.
In the Tamang language, ‘Sai’ means one hundred and ‘Lung’ means hillocks as one can view 108 hillocks in this area. Hence, a trek to Sailung means not only experiencing mountain ranges but local cultural heritage, natural resources and more.
Here is what you should know before your visit to Sailung.
This place is approximately 173 km away from Kathmandu. You have to travel 25 km along a dirt road from Mude. Overall, the trip takes around seven hours to reach there.
If you are opting for a local bus, you can get a bus from Ratnapark of Kathmandu. Get on the bus to Bhaise, but get off at Baghkor.
As you reach Baghkor, there are two options for you: either rent an SUV or go for a short hike using the trail from Baghkor to Sailung. Whichever fits your interest, you can go for it and enjoy the trip.
Sailungeshwar Mahadev is a top destination to visit in the area. You have to walk an hour from Kalapani to reach the temple.
Then, you can also take a look at Gaduri Cave, which opens once in 12 years.
You can see many other religious places as you climb up to the height. Moreover, being the highest point of the Mahabharat range, you can get to experience 360 degrees views of several mountains including Gaurishankar, Dhaulagiri and Langtang.
One can climb all 108 hillocks of Sailung, but one needs to allocate three days to climb them all. Then, you can experience the lovely view of the sunrise and sunset and if it is snowing, the snow-capped mountains are also attractive, making you feel like being in heaven.
These hillocks change colours with the seasons. They look dry and flaky in winter, but with snowfall, they look mesmerising. When it snows on the 3,150-metre high peak, all the peaks turn white. There are no trees on the peaks. Therefore, there is a possibility of snow skiing.
Sailung is also famous for its rhododendron forest.
Apart from the homestay, there are some other hotels in Bhaise. You can get rooms here at an affordable price and according to locals, hotels and homestays here are cheaper than in Kalinchok, which is another popular destination to enjoy the snow.
During snowfall or rainfall, however, you should be more cautious as there is a possibility of vehicles and two-wheelers getting stuck on unpaved roads. Walking is appropriate at such times.
It is advised to carry a sleeping bag and prepared food as there are no accommodation facilities in Kalapani while trekking. Whether it is winter or summer, it is a must to carry warm clothes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/destination-sailung-know-before-visit.html,travel
Here are 8 best solo trekking destinations in Nepal,"Thursday, September 8, 2022","There is a different charm in solo trekking in the hills and mountains of Nepal. The best thing about it is that you get to walk at your own pace as you neither have to wait nor have to follow anyone.
In solo trekking, you also get to be very flexible and take detours as you please. Even though there are times you might feel lonely as there would not be anyone to whom you can share or express your feelings, planning and managing logistics for yourself becomes a lot easier.
That said, solo trekking is not as easy as it seems. It comes with a lot of challenges. One of the main disadvantages is you will have no one to help you if you fall or trip. But, if you are careful, this might not be a problem but make sure you have a first aid kit among other necessities with you.
There are many places to trek in Nepal. But, solo trekking, as mentioned, comes with challenges so today we will discuss some treks that can be done alone. These places are usually full of people, which means if you are in trouble, you will have people around you for help.
So, let’s have a look at a few places where solo trekking is possible.
If you are a beginner, this is the ideal solo trekking destination for you. Ghorepani-Poon Hill trek is easy and one of the best if you want to stray trekking solo. The trail is easy and the views from Ghorepani and Pool Hill are just amazing. The sunrise from Poon Hill is just too good to miss out on. If you want to start trekking alone, start here.
Difficulty: Easy
Best time: Spring
The Annapurna Base Camp trek is one of the easiest treks in the country. Starting from either Ghandruk or Landruk, the trek takes around a week to complete. Full of steps, the trek has many tea houses, which will help when you are tired. The trek is quite beautiful too as it takes you from nice hilly areas into a land surrounded by mountains on all sides. Another ideal solo trekking destination even for the first-timers…
Difficulty: Moderate
Best time: Autumn
This is another trek that can be done alone with relative ease. A journey that takes around five days from Pokhara, you will walk through one forest after another until you reach 3,000 metres, after which the terrain becomes something else as you start to float above the clouds.
The trail to Mardi Himal viewpoint, which is at an altitude of 4,500 metres, is full of steep uphill that can be tiresome. But if you are fit enough, this can be easily done.
Difficulty: Moderate
Best time: Spring
This is an offbeat trek in the Annapurna region from where you get to see a panoramic view of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. The trail is full of both uphill and downhill and is not as easy, but places like Tadapani, Dobato, Muldai View Point, Khopra Danda and Khayer Lake will make the trip worthwhile. You can start either from Ghorepani or Ghandruk.
Difficulty: Hard
Best time: Autumn
The Annapurna Circut trek is one of the prettiest treks not just in Nepal but in the world. The trek is quite easy for the most part and is great for solo trekking too. You get to meet a lot of people as you get allured by the changing landscape. It is advised that you do not go to Tilicho Lake and the Thorong Pass alone, but since there will be a lot of people on the trail, just join a group when you go to these places. This is a trek that should be on everyone’s bucket list.
Difficulty: Hard
Best time: Autumn
This is another easy solo trekking destination that could be done by anyone. The trail starts from Dhunche near the Nepal-China border and goes to Langtang valley, which is one of the most beautiful places in the country. Its gentle pace does not have a lot of uphills and takes you back in time and into the life of the Tamangs. The view from Kyanjin Ri and Tsergo Ri is just too good to miss out on and is the only hard part of the trail.
Difficulty: Easy
Best time: Spring
Like the Annapurna Base Camp trek, Everest is also quite easy for solo trekking. There are going to be some hard days, but the trek is smooth and easy and full of some great views of mountains like Thamserku, Ama Dablam, Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse. The trail beyond Namche is just too great. There will be a lot of people on the trail and since it is too commercial, even if you struggle, you would not be left stranded. A must-do trek in one’s lifetime…
Difficulty: Moderate
Best time: Autumn
Gokyo is the crown jewel of the Everest region. Like the EBC, this is just as easy given how it has been commercialised over the years. The trail up to Namche is the same as it is for the EBC, after which it detours to Machermo and into Gokyo lakes. After Namche, the trail is easy-paced and fun as you get up close to the mountains. A trek that can definitely be done alone…

"Nepal welcomes 326,000 foreign tourists in 8 months","Friday, September 2, 2022","Kathmandu, September 2
Statistics show the number of foreign tourists visiting the country is gradually on the rise since the beginning of 2022.

Sherpa: Untold stories of people in the shadows of Everest,"Thursday, September 1, 2022","As climbers from across the world gathered at the base camp of Everest in the spring of 2021, Pradeep Bashyal and Ankit Babu Adhikari were in the villages that fall in the shadows of the mountain meeting the people from the Sherpa community who make climbing Everest possible.
They were there for one goal: to understand the life of the people who had intrigued them since 2014. To pay homage to these people, the two were writing a book titled Sherpa and to make sure they did not miss a beat, the two travelled extensively in areas in Khumbu, Makalu and Rolwalling meeting first-generation climbers and modern ones as they aimed to get an in-depth view of their life, the mountain and mountaineering.
“A lot has been written about them from a foreign perspective, but we both felt it didn’t do them justice. These guys are more than just climbers. All of them have different stories to tell and through the book, we have tried to highlight all of them,” says Bashyal who adds the book is also a symbol of the two’s friendship that spans over a decade.
And, they have been able to do that. The book will be a great read for anyone who wants to know about these people who are more than just climbers. Sherpa takes you into the worlds of climbers like Tenzing Norgay, Kami Rita, Phurba Tashi and Mingma David who climbed mountains for their own reasons. It also gives you an idea of what life was like back in Khumbu before it became a tourism hub and also touches on the dark side of mountaineering.
The seeds of the book were laid in 2014 and the two went on a reporting trip to the Khumbu region to cover the Everest Marathon. There they were in awe of how strong the people were.
“We met a guy from Phortse who ran the marathon and came third. He did so by stopping at a point and drinking chhyaang. He’d been passed by so many people but still was able to finish third. That achievement baffled us then and still does now,” says Adhikari.
Returning to Kathmandu, the two were in constant conversation about doing something. They wanted to publish a magazine. Adhikari, who is also a singer, wanted to do a charity show to buy things for the people from the community. But, other commitments in life meant these plans never materialised until 2019 when the two decided to pitch the idea of a book about Sherpas to international publishers.
“We worked on a proposal after pitching it to different publishers. Our idea was finally accepted and we started working on it in 2020,” says Adhikari.
The book touches on different subjects. The start focuses mostly on life before the commercialisation of Everest and how people from Khumbu went to Tibet crossing Nangpa La to get salt and going as far as Darjeeling to sell it.
The writers have dwelled on life before Everest for the people who were far away from the outside world given their geographical nature.
“They were never aware of the British Gurkhas and Nepali kings and other rulers never really cared for them. Mountaineering changed their lives,” says Bashyal.
But, post-commercialisation, most of the stories of the mountaineers are the same as almost 90 per cent start off as a porter and make their way up to becoming climbing guides. Telling different stories from them was going to be a major challenge.
“We wanted to write something in every chapter,” says Bashyal.
And, they have. They have chapters on Phurba Tashi Sherpa, one of the most decorated climbers in the country who quit climbing abruptly. They touch on his career and why he choose to end his career when he was at the peak of his powers.
There is also a chapter on becoming a Sherpa and how times have changed. The book focuses on how many first-generation Sherpas started climbing for good gear and food and after which the focus was more on the money made from it.
“Most of them continue to climb for money with only a few now starting to climb for legacy and record,” says Adhikari.
One of the first who climbed for legacy was Jamling Norgay, Tenzing Norgay’s son. The writers went to Darjeeling to meet Jamling and visit Tenzing Norgay’s house to understand why his father climbed Everest.
“Tenzing climbed for passion because the mountain continued to pull him towards it. We got to see how important he is to the Sherpa community to date,” says Bashyal.
The chapter about Tenzing takes you to Darjeeling and how so many Sherpa’s followed his footsteps to Darjeeling looking for a better life and settling around Toong Soong and Alubari. It tells the reader how great a man Tenzing was and how he helped whoever came to his doorstep. But, it also highlights how two questions, one regarding his nationality and the other regarding who climbed first always plagued him.
A book about the Sherpas would be incomplete without talking about the sacrifices made by people. And, the book has different chapters that highlight the deaths on the mountain. It takes you back to 2014 when an avalanche on the icefall killed 16 Nepali climbers from the Sherpa community. On this day, many lost friends and their families as it still remains one of the darkest days in climbing.
“Speaking about death is the hardest thing for these people and that was a major challenge for us as we didn’t want to trigger the traumas that these people went through,” says Bashyal.
But, they admit they were lucky as they got to speak to so many people. With the Covid lockdown in full swing, they got a lot of time to speak to even busy climbers like Mingma David and Tendi Sherpa.
These people recommended them to speak to others and that is how they ended up in Rolwalling through which they have been able to tell the story of a family of climbers who they spent two weeks with.
“We are also glad that many spoke to us away from their comfort zone, which has helped us a lot to bring out interesting stories in the book. But we were very patient with people ’cause we know how reserved they are,” says Bashyal, adding they spent hours with people to get information from them.
A story about Kushang Dorje Sherpa who lives in Darjeeling is a particularly interesting one as the writers have delved well into his past where he was sold in Bhutan to a contractor and how he escaped the camp and became the only person to climb Everest from the south, north and east face. His story is that of overcoming ultimate despair to becoming the king of Everest, something a shaman had told him as he was trapped in Bhutan.
The book also has stories about climbers who have become businessmen like Ang Tsering Sherpa who owns Asian Trekking, one of the oldest trekking and mountaineering companies and Mingma, Chhang Dawa and Tashi Sherpa who together run Seven Summit Treks, the country’s most popular mountaineering company which has changed the face of mountaineering in the country and given employment opportunities to hundreds of Sherpas from their home region of Sankhuwasabha.
The final chapters of the book focus on the changing mountain. The Sherpas realise that mountains are changing and that global warming is posing different challenges to them. But, that said, most are certain that things will not change as it is a major source of income not just for the Nepali climbers but also for the government.
The writers have juxtaposed the mountain with the climbers in a beautiful manner through which they have tried and spread the message that even though the climbers are getting stronger and better, the mountain, on the other hand, is not and that is mostly due to the climate crisis plaguing the world.
The book is a must-read for those who want to know about Nepali climbers and how they have evolved over the years. It is a great history lesson for both Nepalis and foreigners, most of whom do not know about the challenges of climbing and why these people risk their lives.
While most books about mountaineering focus on the mountains, this does not as it focuses on the people who live in their shadows and that is what makes the book stand out.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sherpa-book-bashyal-adhikari.html,travel
3 airports to have new terminal buildings,"Thursday, August 25, 2022","Kathmandu, August 25
The government has planned to construct three advanced terminal buildings in three domestic airports.

Khaptad is heaven every monsoon thanks to blossoming wildflowers,"Saturday, August 20, 2022","I was at a coffee shop in Kathmandu when Deepak Khadka called me from Khaptad valley telling me how the green meadows in the area were full of multicoloured wildflowers.
That instantly pulled me as Khaptad has always drawn me. Every time I visit here, I feel I experience something new. This time, I was there for the wildflowers and it did not disappoint.
It was the last week of July, and the monsoon was in full swing. But, as it was then when the wildflowers blossom, I could not resist as I and a friend boarded a flight to Dhangadhi.
After a few hours there, we left for Jhigarna. As both of us are religious, we stopped at multiple temples en route to Jhigrana. The journey from Silgadhi to Jhigrana takes an hour on an SUV; if you are waking, it will take around three hours. This was where we spent our first night before we headed towards Khaptad.
The next day, our trek started. The trail was mostly uphill and we had to walk for around five hours. Getting past some steep terrain and walking in the rain we got to Bichpani where he rested and ate some warm food before we headed towards Khaptad.
The rain and the jungle were a dangerous combination. It felt like I was in a thriller film. The rain was constant and the loud bang of thunderstorms was constant. The trail was muddy and misty which made it extremely difficult.
But, what made the trek worthwhile was our first view of the meadows of Khaptad. I had seen the meadows before this time also, but what I loved about it this time were the wildflowers on them. It was magical. The green fields were full of blue, red, yellow and white wildflowers. It was so captivating that I forgot everything in the world. All the pain from walking was gone. I was at one with nature and had so glad that I had come.
Let’s talk about Khaptad for a bit. It is a haven for people who love nature. A meeting point of four districts – Bajhang, Doti, Bajura and Achham, Khaptad is one of the prettiest places not just in Nepal but maybe the world. The place is full of meadows and hillocks which makes the place’s topography very unique.
The place also gives its name to Khaptad Baba, also known as Swami Sachchidananda, who was a spiritual saint who settled here in the 1940s and lived there for 50 years.
So, this place is not just a natural paradise; it is also a spiritual abode where saints and sages have taken refuge since time as it is even mentioned in the holy books.
The place is also a national park which goes up to 3,200 metres and spreads over 225 square kilometres.
There’s no particular season to get here. During the monsoon, the place is lush green with lots of wildflowers. In the winter months, these meadows are full of snow. And during the spring, these fields glow like gold.
The valley has a different aura in all seasons and has quite a few places to visit too. It has Khaptad Baba’s ashram, the Triveni river, Khaptad Daha, Shiva temple, Sahashra linga, Ganesh temple, Nagdhunga and Kedardhunga. During the full moon of March, the area also hosts the Ganga Dashahara fair, which is also a great time to be here.
As I have mentioned, the valley connects four districts and one can get here from any one of them. But, the easiest route to get there is through Doti. Even though this route is used by everyone, it is recommended that you take a guide as there are many areas where you can get lost.
Another thing to keep in mind when travelling to Khaptad is to decide where to stay. The place does not have many hotels. After Jhigrana, the only stop point before getting to your final destination is Bichpani, where you have to inform beforehand if you want a warm meal. As the distance between Jhirgrana to Khaptad is around eight hours, this is the only place to stop for tea or food.
Facility-wise, the place is pretty average. There are no hotels beyond Jhigrana but there will not be issues as people happily give people a place to stay at their homes. But as I said earlier, you need to tell people beforehand that you are coming. For that, please ask the hotel in Jhigrana to connect you with someone higher up.
Also, there is no electricity in the area.

Kathmandu-Ilam direct flights halted as local govt ends contract,"Monday, August 15, 2022","Kathmandu, August 15
Kathmandu-Ilam direct flights have been halted after the local government ended a contract to compensate for the airline company’s possible loss.
Whereas the operator, Tara Air, says the flights will resume as the route was economically feasibly, it is not clear when the resumption will happen.
To begin regular flights, the airline company had signed a contract with the Ilam municipality, according to which the local government would compensate if there were less than 11 passengers on one flight. The company had operated an 18-seat Twin Otter aircraft on the route.
The company’s spokesperson Sudarshan Bartaula says the municipal government did not need to spend more than Rs 300,000 in the past six months. Hence, Bartaula says the direct flights will take place as the number of people visiting Ilam increases, hopefully after the monsoon.

Nepal prepares to open new mountains to climbers,"Monday, August 15, 2022","Kathmandu, August 15
Nepal is preparing to open some new mountains to climbers to attract more visitors, says Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Jeevan Ram Shrestha.
Addressing the 32nd general assembly of the Nepal Mountaineering Association on Sunday, Minister Shrestha said the government was preparing to open new peaks between 5,800 and 8,000 metres.
The government was currently reviewing which new mountains would be appropriate for climbing in terms of economic benefits of climbing for the locals among other aspects, according to him.
He also stressed the need for more adventurous tourism and sports options to attract more visitors to the country.

Challenges galore as date for Pokhara Regional International Airport launch nears,"Thursday, August 11, 2022","Pokhara, August 11
The government has decided that the newly constructed airport in Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, will begin its operation on January 1, 2023, as the third international airport in Nepal.
Even though there are less than five months for the launch, a lot needs to be done to ensure the Pokhara Regional International Airport runs smoothly.
The first issue Pokhara Regional International Airport operators face is the landfill site that is close to it. Pokhara metropolitan city was asked to relocate the landfill site over four years ago, but the city has done nothing.
“They decided to start the airport in haste. I don’t think it’s possible,” says Gandaki Provincial Tourism Minister Mani Bhadra Sharma.
Another issue the airport faces is the hill to the east as it l needs to be razed. There has been no effort made to start razing the hill even though there are only five months remaining for Pokhara Regional International Airport to start its operation.
The airport operators also need to build a fuel depot along with managing the sewage pipeline that passes through the airport. Building for security personnel has not been built either. The government says it will sort these out before January 1, 2023.
But, is it so?
Due to the landfill, the area also has a lot of birds. Even though the Pokhara metropolitan government has said it will temporarily relocate the landfill, Sharma says the birds will not leave the area anytime soon.
“It will take one year for the birds to disappear,” says Man Shanta Ghimire, the president of Pokhara Bird Society. “It’s a major area for birds like vultures and eagles. They have set up nets there and it will take a long time for them to leave.”
Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Jeevan Ram Shrestha says they will use technology that has been used abroad if need be to remove the birds in the area.
This will be a major challenge as there are around 162 species of birds near the airport. Bird conservation activist Hemanta Dhakal says out of those, five species are endangered.
“We need to be sensitive to this issue as we haven’t relocated a bird’s nest in Nepal. Since these are endangered, we have to be extra careful,” says Dhakal, adding it will take more than a year to relocate birds.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/pokhara-regional-international-airport-challenge.html,travel

Pokhara businesses urge authorities to continue paragliding even after new airport’s operation,"Wednesday, August 10, 2022","Kathmandu, August 10
Tourism business operators in Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, have demanded that authorities ensure the continuity of paragliding services even after the new airport’s operation.
With the news of the new international airport coming into operation from January 1 next year, the businesses fear the new facility would close paragliding, one of the most popular pastimes for tourists visiting the city, as the current locations of paraglider flights are within the airspace of the new airport.
Binesh Munakarmi, the chief of the new airport project, says all aviation activities should stop in the Sarankot area as soon as the new airport comes into operation. “We can’t make sure every plane lands at the airport immediately,” he says, “Some of them may need to hover in the sky. Sarankot is the area that we want to use for that purpose.”
But, tourism entrepreneurs say the government needs to find an alternative before January so that paragliding can continue within the city.
“We don’t want to shift it anywhere. We need to explore how it can go together with the airport,” Sunil Bahadur Bhattarai, the president of the Nepal Airsports Association (NAA), says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/pokhara-continue-paragliding-demand.html,travel
9 books about Everest that every mountain enthusiast should read,"Tuesday, August 9, 2022","Books about Everest are not a rarity. Over the course of history, over a hundred books have been written about the highest mountain on Earth. Some shed light on a particular year and an incident while some were written about the climbers’ experience reaching the top of the world.
Every book about Everest is different and gives the reader a different insight. These books also tell people a lot about the mountain, what it takes to climb it and what goes through an expedition and how teams overcome challenges in the ‘death zone’.
But, what books to read? Today, we bring you a list of books about Everest that will help you understand the mountain a little more.
This is one of the most read books about Everest. Written by Jon Krakauer, the book details Krakauer’s experience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. The book is great evidence of how the rise of commercial climbing was posing a major threat to everyone on the mountain. A detailed and harrowing travelogue should be read by anyone who is remotely fascinated by Everest.
This is an autobiography about the first person to reach the summit of Everest – Tenzing Norgay. The book takes you into the life of Tenzing Norgay, how he got into mountaineering, the Sherpa culture and the first ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary. The book will take you back in time to the early 1990s through to the time when he time and again went to Everest only to come back empty-handed. It is a gem to understand what it meant to climb the mountain for a person born in the Everest region. One of the timeless books about Everest…
This is one of the latest books about Everest, but it takes us back nearly 100 years to one of the early expeditions by Andrew Irvine and George Mallory. The book tells the story of a few ambitious climbers who search for the body of Irvine which, to date, has never been found. It also covers how modern-day commercialisation has broken the mountain and sheds light on issues including the infamous traffic jam on Everest.
This book about Tenzing Norgay’s son Jamling Tenzing Norgay is a riveting read. From his childhood to becoming the son of the guy who climbed Everest, the book takes you on a journey along with Jamling who reached the top of the world following his father’s footsteps leading the 1996 IMAX team. As one of the best books about Everest, it shows how desperate Jamling wanted to climb the mountain and how his father wanted his son to find his own way to the top. A must-have on the list of books about Everest…
This book is all about survival. Beck Weathers was a part of the 1996 team that Jon Krakauer was also a part of and was assumed dead after he fell unconscious due to fatigue and altitude sickness. Left for dead, Weathers woke up, frostbitten and near dead. Yet, he dug deep into his core to find strength and made it down the mountain the same year some parts of his team, including expedition leader Rob Hall, died. It is a great comeback story among the best books about Everest.
This is another book about the 1924 Everest expedition. In the book, adventurer Conrad Anker pieces together what might have happened to the two climbers who got lost forever on the mountain. Anker also writes how he and his team were able to find Malory’s body in the mountain. The manner in which the past and present have been intertwined makes this one of the most interesting books about Everest.
A book about the 1996 disaster, The Climb tells the story from the perspective of the commercial expedition leader. Following the 1996 disaster, co-writer Anatoli Boukreev was criticised heavily for the failings of the expeditions. Boukreev had decided to climb without oxygen and has been criticised by everyone including Jon Krakauer who said Boukreev not using oxygen was not in the client’s best interests. In the book, Boukreev defends not using oxygen and tells how he went into the heart of the storm to rescue three clients alive. This book certainly should be on your list of books about Everest.
On August 20, 1980, Reinhold Messner reached the summit of Everest alone and without the use of oxygen. This book captures exactly that. Messner takes us on a journey to Tibet, a place that remained a mystery to a lot of people. He talks about the hardship of climbing a mountain like Everest alone and how the body feels when deprived of oxygen and why he takes risks. It also has the diary entry of his then-girlfriend Nina Holguin, which gives some nuance to people who wanted to learn more about Messner.
The Next Everest is the true story of climber Jim Davidson who survived a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that set off avalanches across the world’s highest peak in 2015. Davidson had trained hard to prepare himself to climb Everest, but on April 25, 2015, an avalanche from Pumori wrecked Everest base camp. Jim survived. This book shows how he came back, both physically and psychologically, and reached the summit of Everest in the spring of 2017. It also answers some questions people pose. Why do climbers put themselves at such risk? How could Jim even think about doing Everest again? The questions are eloquently answered in this thrilling memoir and one of the most gripping books about Everest.

Mangal Lama shares the thrilling adventure of cycling along the Great Himalayan Trail,"Monday, August 8, 2022","When Mangal Lama set off to do the Great Himalayan Trail on his bicycle alone, he knew he would be facing a lot of challenges. But, what happened at the West Col Pass in the Makalu Barun region nearly broke him.
He had reached the top of the pass with his porter and was on his way down. The trail was full of hard blue ice – dangerous if you do not have the proper gear. Lama was scared for himself and his porter. As he was about to finish the toughest section on the trail, he saw all his belongings fall down.
His porter slipped on the blue ice. Luckily, he was able to hang on to the rope on the trail, but all of Lama’s belongings including his tent, sleeping bag, portable gas canisters, food, cycle gear and clothes fell.
“It was a disaster,” he says. “I thought I was done. I had nothing and had lost all hope because I lost everything. I was doubting if I should continue.”
But, he did not give up. Not wanting to give up on his dream, he came to Kathmandu, got gears he had lost, and returned to Baruntse base camp to continue heading west. But, the journey to get to Hilsa in far-western Nepal was not easy. He continued to face problems.
Mangal Lama had self-doubts. He missed his family and the comforts of home. There were days he hardly slept due to the cold weather. Despite wanting to give up multiple times, he did what he set out to do and completed the 1,700-kilometre journey from Kanchenjunga base camp in the east to Hilsa in the far west in 88-days becoming the first person to do so on his bicycle alone.
“It was so hard that I don’t think I’ll even think of doing that again. But looking back, it was a journey of a lifetime,” says Lama.
Mangal Lama’s journey started from the Kanchenjunga base camp in the east. Before he started, he was in a major dilemma. He had received a job offer from a construction company in the United Kingdom. He was also asked to halt his project as there were a lot of guiding trips on offer. Having given his word, he decided to let everything behind and went on a journey of a lifetime.
The first phase was tough. With most of the trail not fit enough for cycling, he carried around 40 kilograms on his back. It was tiring, both mentally and physically. He recalls eastern Nepal as being very raw. The people were amused seeing him walking and cycling alone. When he flew his drone, kids would surround him.
“It was great seeing how simple things brought them joy. These remote places are beautiful, but the life there is so hard.”
Mangal Lama recalls wanting to eat meat in the village of Thudam in eastern Nepal. Despite having meat, the locals refused to feed him. He was shocked but later found that they cut one yak a year and divide it among the village.
“When you find out things like these, it humbles you. The village was completely dependent on China for food. But, since Covid, the border was closed and people from this village are suffering a lot.”
From Thudam, Mangal Lama moved further west to Rolwaling and on to the Everest region via Sherpaini Col. There, he lost all his gear after his porter slipped. Losing his gear caused a major issue as he was planning to camp somewhere below Baruntse base camp. But, now, with everything lost, he had no plan.
“I’m really glad nothing happened to the porter, but I was very stressed about what to do next.”
Fate was on his side. There was a team of climbers at the Baruntse base camp to give him refuge. He spent a few nights there and called for a rescue chopper who took him to Lukla to return to Kathmandu.
After managing supplies and cash, Mangal Lama returned to Barunste to continue. He was having doubts about continuing it, but he carried on not wanting to be a quitter. He reached the Everest region where he fell ill. He called his doctor who told him he needed proper food and rest. Even though he did not want to do that, he had no choice but to do so.
“That was hard.”
From Everest, he moved towards Rolwaling. He moved further west towards Langtang and then towards Ruby valley and on to the Manaslu region and the Annapurnas. The more he moved west, the more he got to cycle. The trials were beautiful as was the scenery.
“The happiness I felt even if I got to cycle for 30 minutes in a day is something I’ll never forget.”
But, there were some moments which frustrated Mangal Lama. Due to a lack of proper trails, he got lost a lot in the hilly forest. There were even days when he climbed four to five hours only to return to where he came from. He often took the help of his drone he had taken to document his journey to find ways on a trail which were rarely walked by trekkers.
“I had to change the route a lot. There was a day when a person from an area in Sindupalchok asked me to not go to a particular village because the locals there had recently robbed a traveller. As I was alone, I decided not to risk it and went the way the locals suggested.”
As Mangal Lama moved west, the monsoon had started. The rain posed a major challenge due to slippery trails, leeches and swollen rivers. But, it also gave him the chance to witness something beautiful.
The hills were green as were the fields that surrounded had tons of wildflowers adding to the already spectacular scenery. Even when tired, scenes like these lifted his morale as he often told himself why he had come there.
He had carried a lot of things with him during the start. But, by the time he crossed Mustang and on to Dolpo, he had realised he did not need many.
“I let go of my tents, cooking equipment and a lot of excess gear that I didn’t need. I wish I had a team with me that would have helped me from phase to phase with these items as after Kanchenjunga, I didn’t have to carry a tent as people mostly were hospitable and gave me a place to sleep and food to eat.”
Walking alone with so much weight was Mangal Lama’s biggest challenge, even more than crossing over 20 high passes. He knew it would be hard but looking back now, he recalls this was one the toughest thing he has ever done.
“It was so hard that I’ll not even think about doing this again,” he says.
But, Mangal Lama did have fun. Looking at the bemused faces of locals who saw a bicycle for the first time gave him joy. Most of them questioned why he was alone and why he was doing it on the cycle. Some even told him that this was a bad idea to be doing it alone. Others would be amused at his perseverance and his sheer determination.
“These things were amusing to me too.”
When he reached Hilsa in far-west Nepal, he was brimming with joy. He had made it. Through sheer will, he had completed the Great Himalayan Trail in 88 days. But, he knew that this was only the start as he wants to help promote the trial which he believes can be great for the tourism sector in the country.
“There’s so much potential on this trail, but it needs to be managed well. The route has both easy and technical trails for cycling and I’ve even thought of preparing a map dedicated to cycling.”
Mangal Lama also thinks the promotion of the trail would be great for the people living in these areas. With most of them away from district headquarters, creating homestays on the trail would be great to sustain livelihood.
Now, Lama is working on a book and a documentary as he wants to promote Nepal and the trail all over the world. He feels it can be the best place for technical riders, but more than that it can be a great tourism product just for the views this place offers.
“It is hard. It is brutal. It will test your inner ability,” Mangal Lama says, “But, this is what adventure is and I’m glad to have done it.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mangal-lama-ght-over.html,travel

7 must-watch movies about Everest if you want to understand the world’s highest peak,"Thursday, August 4, 2022","Mount Everest! It is probably the most searched word about Nepal on the internet.

Over the course of history, there have been some great movies about Everest too. These films show how people climb, what it takes for them to climb, how the body adapts to the death zone and what it means to reach the top of the high point on earth.
Today, we bring to you a list of these documentaries and movies about Everest, which are a must-watch if you want to understand the mountain and those who climb them and how it has changed over the years.
This is one of the first documentaries to have been made about climbing Everest. Shot on the north side of the mountain, the documentary shows the attempt made by George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. Made by John Noel, the film helped establish a redemptive vision of the failed expedition where both Mallory and Irvine died. It is a one-of-a-kind documentary that shows how climbing was in the early 1900s, the things they had to take into consideration and the local lifestyle of the people living in the mountains.
As one of the best movies about Everest, this film tells the story of the first two men who climbed Everest – Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary. Directed by George Lowe, the documentary educates the audience about previous attempts at climbing the mountain and what the two did differently. It also shows how they prepared to climb, the acclimatisation camps and captures the pure emotion of Sherpa and Hillary after they achieved the impossible.
This documentary tells the story of the crazy Japanese alpinist Yuichiro Miura who in the spring of 1970, skied down Everest. The documentary, which won the Oscars in 1976, gives the audience a background on Miura and how he planned to ski off the tallest mountain in the world. One of the most interesting movies about Everest, the film shows his descent off the mountain and the harsh realities of climbing as around six Nepali climbers supporting the Japanese expedition died.
This is one of the movies about Everest that shows the downside of commercial mountaineering. Based on a book by Jon Krakauer, the film tells the story of the 1996 Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. It shows how inexperienced climbers on a mountain like Everest played a major role in the death of people. Another film was made in 2015 titled Everest based on the same book, but since this was made a year after the disaster, it holds significant importance in the history of Everest and commercial mountaineering.
The Wildest Dream is a 2010 feature documentary film about George Mallory who disappeared on Mount Everest in 1924 with his climbing partner Andrew Irvine. As one of the best movies about Everest, The film tells the story of two climbers, Mallory and adventurer Conrad Anker, who discovered Mallory’s body in 1999. The film also shows how Anker and British climber Leo Houlding try and emulate the manner in which Mallory and Irving climbed Everest.
This is one of the most important documentary movies about Everest. Titled Sherpa, the film focuses on the list of Phurba Tashi who, by 2015, had climbed Everest 21 times. It also shows how Nepali climbers, despite being beasts on mountains like Everest, were never given the due credit they deserved. It shows the harsh reality of these support climbers who make climbing a mountain like Everest possible as it shows how 16 Nepali support climbers died on the mountain when the Khumbu Icefall collapsed.
This is another underrated gem among movies about Everest, in which a foreigner tries to become a porter and takes clients to the base camp. But, it is not all easy for American Nathaniel Menninger whose journey to succeed experiences the harsh reality, which shows the audience the dark side of Everest. With the pain of those who help make things possible for the people to reach the base of the highest mountain in the world, it is funny, it is emotional and it is heartbreaking. This film makes you realise the privileges you have.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/must-watch-movies-about-everest.html,travel

"Over 6,000 passengers travelled from and to Gautam Buddha International Airport in 2 months","Thursday, July 21, 2022","Kathmandu, July 21
In the first two months of its operation, Nepal’s second international airport, Gautam Buddha International Airport, 6,320 people travelled from and to this station internationally.
Currently, Jazeera Airways is conducting three flights between Bhairahawa and Doha via Kuwait City every week. Wizz Airlines is preparing to start Bhairahawa flights from Abu Dhabi. “They will probably begin by September end,” informs the airport chief Govinda Dahal.
However, the airport did not record any foreign trade activity, both import and export, informs the customs office chief Gyanendra Raj Dhakal.
“During the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we received some goods,” he says, “But, they were customs-free goods. Further, they returned the goods to India.”
Because most passengers using the Gautam Buddha International Airport are labour migrants, trade activities could not happen in these months, according to officials.
In the period, 2,923 international passengers landed at the airport whereas 3,397 flew off, according to the airport officials.

A trek to Kapuche lake: Out of place and out of time–in the time of global warming,"Tuesday, July 19, 2022","Standing in front of Nepal’s lowest glacial lake, I could not help but wonder how global warming affected Nepal’s glaciers and the Himalayas. The Kapuche lake, around two decades ago, was a full-fledged glacier. But, as years went by, due to increasing temperatures, the ice melted creating a turquoise lake and giving rise to yet another trekking destination for both domestic and foreign trekkers.
Kapuche is remote, located at the base of the Annapurnas. The path to the lake is not the easiest. It goes up and down several hills. One has to walk past one jungle after another to get to the lowest glacial lake in the country. There is even a section where a landslide has whipped out an entire section of the jungle, which makes you wonder who was the first to walk this treacherous path and why.
“It was the French who first came here,” said Rudra Gurung, a hotel owner near Kapuche. “They came here to climb Annapurna II.”
As he said that, we heard a huge crack.
“Avalanche,” he said, pointing to the mountain. “This is common here. This place is called Kapuche because of this.”
According to Gurung, Kapuche in his native language means a valley where an avalanche falls. And, in the 12 hours we spent there, we sure saw (and heard) a lot of it.
In the autumn of 2021, for my annual trek, I left Kathmandu to go to Mardi Himal. But, fate had another plan as I ended up on a MUV to Sikles, a Gurung village on the lap of the Annapurnas, to trek to the Kapuche lake.
A day before, I had spent the night at Sanu Lake, a little oasis at the Begnas lake where I met photographer Rishav Adhikari, also known as Shutter Pyscho. He urged us to go somewhere, which was not commercial. He suggested a few places around Pokhara, but in the end, we decided that Kapuche would be the best.
After boating and swimming in the lake, we got on a MUV that took us through a treacherous and typical hilly road to a quaint Gurung village.
“The road is always this bad. They say they’ll make it, but no one cares. During the monsoon, we rarely drive,” said our driver.
Normally, he takes around 10 people in his vehicle although it can hold up to eight people maximum. Since no one monitors, he fits as many people as he can when there is demand.
“People even sit on the roof,” he said.
But, we were only six and reached Sikles relatively comfortably.
Sikles is like any other Gurung village in the Annapurnas. The people are warm, welcoming and kind. But, that said, they will put you in your place if you behave badly. Despite us reaching the village at around 9 pm, a family still welcomed us and prepared us a warm meal.
It is an ideal place where you can learn a lot about the Gurung lifestyle. While Ghandruk has become far too commercial, Sikles still has a certain rawness about it. The place also has some great views.

Its viewpoint, Rising Danda, an hour’s walk from the village, offers majestic views of the mountains like Annapurna II and Lamjung Himal. The green meadow on top of the hill will make you feel you are somewhere in Europe.
“A lot of people camp there. If you come to Sikles, you have to go there,” insisted Maya Gurung, our host.
The next morning, Radha didi called Rudra dai to take us to Kapuche. Rudra dai recently opened a lodge near the lake itself. Looking at our carefree state, he looked agitated. He kept on insisting we needed to start trekking as the route was long but we did not care and took almost two hours to get ready as we left Sikles around 10 am.
Initially, the trail was easy. Facing the mountains, we walked downhill for about an hour, after which we regretted our decision to walk late.
It was midday and the sun was killing us. Climbing a steep hill in that sun was probably the worst decision we made. We were slow, but we made it. Looking at the frustrated face of Rudra dai, we asked him not to wait for us.
“Keep hydrating. Fill your bottles at every water point you see because the journey is a long one and you won’t find a place to eat or rest until Hugugoth,” he said as he told us he would wait for us at the lodge.
The Kapuche trail is probably one of the trickiest I have seen. One moment, you are going downhill; a moment later, you are going through a steep climb. But, that said, I felt free walking to the glacier. The fall colours and the cool breeze were the highlights of the trek. It had been a while since I had walked a jungle trail and this trip reminded me of how beautiful jungles are.
One of the best moments of the trip was the Edi waterfall. Standing on a suspension bridge, watching the waterfall I felt like time stood still. It was here that I was reminded that this was why I trekked. These types of moments cannot be found in the city. This is why I go somewhere new every year. And after a couple of pictures and a few drone shots later, we realised it was getting dark and we had a long way to go.
There is one thing that is sad about this trail to Kapuche. There are no teahouses or houses in between. That means you have to reach Hugugoth for tea or food. From the waterfall, the trail is steep until you reach Hugugoth.
By the time we got there, it was around 4 pm and we were both tired and hungry.
“A few boys had set up a place to eat and stay near the waterfall, but they were too lazy. If that tea house was there, it would have been a lot easy for trekkers,” says Maila Gurung of Nasmate Guest House.
Maila dai and his wife prepared us food. Eating that, we started our final two-hour hike to Kapuche.
“Make sure you follow the trail. It is going to be dark so be extra careful,” he said.
Bidding him farewell, we left around 6 pm. The trail from Hugugoth was mostly uphill. We walked mostly through the jungle. For the first hour, we had daylight with us, but soon we had to use headlamps and mobile phones to ensure we were on the right trail.
As the clock struck 8 pm, a part of us felt we were lost as we had walked nearly 10 hours, but our destination, Kapuche glacial lake, was nowhere in sight. We had started our trek at 10 am from Sikles and had walked casually the entire day making fun of the signboards that said Kapuche was 10 hours away. But there we were, walking in the dark on the narrow jungle trail knowing one slip would be the end.
The sound of the jungle was bone-chilling. All I could hear was the sound of the river below and those of the insects in the jungle. I was scared. We all were as we wondered if we had taken the wrong trail, but we were wrong.
After 10 hours through a trail that mostly involved walking in the jungle, we made it. People were looking at us with surprise asking us if we were tired. But we were not tired. We were relieved and in a way excited to see the lowest glacial lake in Nepal.
We were the first to get to Kapuche. It was as quiet and fresh. The lake is as clear as it can get. But as I mentioned above, I was in two minds. A part of me was happy I made it there, but another part was thinking about what this lake meant.
Over the past, we have heard about a glacial collapse in many parts of the Himalayas. There is fear among locals that this too will face a similar fate. They understand global warming. They know how the climate is changing. But, they also feel helpless. They know they can do nothing about it. I had a similar feeling as I left the place hoping (and praying) that it does not collapse because it is a place where people should go at least once in their life.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kapuche-lake-global-warming.html,travel
Visit Lumbini to experience Buddhist cultures from around the world. Here’s the guide,"Saturday, July 9, 2022","Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, attracts many visitors throughout the year. This is primarily because Lumbini’s importance is not restricted to a particular religion, but it is equally significant for the development of the tourism sector of Nepal.
One of the key attractions of Lumbini these days, besides the historic Maya Devi Temple, is several monasteries built by Buddhist communities in different parts of the world. These monasteries have made the place a hub to learn and experience Buddhist cultures that are in existence from around the world. Visiting Lumbini is not only fun but also a learning opportunity.
If you are looking for a break and want to get out from your everyday hustle, visiting Lumbini from September to December can help you wind down. It means July is the best time to plan.
Hence, today, we will help you with a focus on how you can make your experience of different Buddhist cultures more interesting.
In Lumbini, monastic zones, a part of the Lumbini Development Master Plan, can be your focus if you are interested in varieties of Buddhism and Buddhist cultures. They also offer you a chance to indulge in the beauty of both natural and artificial heritage.
According to the Lumbini Development Master Plan approved by Nepal Government in 1978, the monastic zone is divided into two sections—the east and the west—comprising 32 monasteries representing different nations from around the world. Some are still under construction.
The East Monastic Zone represents the Theravada (Hinayana) school of Buddism and accommodates monasteries like The Royal Thai Monastery, Thailand; Canadian Engaged Buddhism Association (Bodhi Institute Monastery and Dharma Centre) (under construction); Mahabodhi Society Temple of India; Nepal Theravada Buddha Vihar (under construction); Cambodian Temple, Cambodia (under construction); Myanmar Golden Temple, Myanmar; International Gautami Nuns Temple, Nepal; Sri Lankan Monastery, Sri Lanka and Dhamma Janani Vipassana Centre, Nepal.
Then, the West Monastic Zone comprises Ka-Nying Shedrup Monastery (Seto Gumba), Nepal (under construction); Zarong Tgupten Mendol Dogna Chholing, Nepal (under construction); Urgen Dorjee Chholing Buddhist Centre, Singapore; Nepal Vajrayana Maha Vihara, Nepal (under construction); French Buddhist Association, France; The Great Lotus Stupa (Tara Foundation), Germany; Drigung Kagyud Meditation Centre, Laddakh; The World Linh Son Buddhist Congregation, France; Japanese Monastery, Japan (under construction); United Tungaram Buddhist Foundation, Nepal; Thrangu Vajra Vidhya Buddhist Association, Canada; Vietnam Phat Quoc Tu, Vietnam; Geden International Monastery, Austria; Chinese Monastery, China; Dae Sung Shakya Temple, South Korea; Drubgyud Chhoeling Monastery (Nepal Mahayana Temple); Dharmodhaya Sabha Nepal (Swayambhu Mahavihara); Karma Samtenling Monastery, Nepal; Manang Samaj Stupa, Nepal; and Pandirarama Lumbini International Meditation Centre, Myanmar.
You can be amazed at the beauty of these monasteries where you will be able to understand and experience how monasteries are built around the world having their own unique style and design.
Some of the monasteries restrict taking photos and videos.
It is better you wear your socks as you will have to take off your shoes at these monasteries. And the sun is usually scorchingly hot in Lumbini, making your bare feet uncomfortable while walking on the pathways and restricting you to enjoy yourself fully.
Moreover, except for these monastic zones, other attractions inside the area are the statue of a standing baby Buddha, the central canal and its boating facility, the eternal peace flame, the peace bell, etc. Visit them too if you have time.
Boating on the canal cost you around Rs 80 for one-way travel.
There are a few monasteries that still do not welcome visitors due to the national-level pandemic policy of that particular host country.
These monastic zones cover a big area. Hence, if you want to roam around comfortably, you can hire an electric autorickshaw (tuktuk) to get around. This costs you Rs 1,200 per hour, but it sure is convenient as you will have its driver as your personal guide who can direct you around.
These rickshaws are managed by a local authority and they have a queue system. Hence, there will not be any hassle while using them.
However, if you want to spend more time indulging in each of the monasteries, walking around might be the best option. But, be sure to take a map as you might get lost and walk around round and round.

9 best fun activities to explore in Nepal this monsoon,"Saturday, July 2, 2022","In Nepal, the monsoon begins in June and lasts until mid-September. With the arrival of the monsoon season, many might want to keep themselves warm in their beds and do nothing but sleep. After all, monsoons are a great time to get comfy, drink hot beverages, read books, watch movies, sit by the window and stare at the rain as well.
However, keeping active throughout this season is equally essential. This season has a lot to offer, from adventure to sports. And if you are interested and looking for something to do during monsoon/summer, we have got some fascinating ideas for you.
Monsoon is one of the most cherished seasons around the globe. Rain has just evoked a wide range of emotions in humans for generations. It is a season that is not only full of heat but also gives people sheer joy. It is also a period when the city’s rain-soaked flora shines out. Some individuals eagerly await the monsoon to bring more vegetation into their houses. With rainfall that has not yet dried out, the green terrain appears a little greener. If greenery makes you happy, the smell of the fresh air after the rain and the blooming flora is quite a sight to look upon.
Taking a city day trip after it has rained during the monsoon season will give you a new perspective of the city. After the rain has washed away the dullness and mist from nature, a city day visit will feel much more calm than normal. To gain a better perspective of the city, you can walk to the top of Swayambhu Stupa and gaze upon Kathmandu or you can go around the durbar square areas of the Kathmandu valley. You may also go to Pokhara and see Devi’s waterfall. Or, visit the Lumbini World Peace Pagoda, which will undoubtedly give you a feel of peace.
If you enjoy staying active during the monsoon, rafting in the white rivers can be for you. It is a difficult yet exciting adventure sport that takes place in Nepal’s big white water rapids. The rivers in Nepal are mainly formed by glaciers melting, making them excellent for rafting on flowing water. The rain heightens the ferocity of the raging white rivers. If white river rafting without the rainy season is thrilling, the experience gets multiplied throughout the season. Without a doubt, the rafting staff will prioritise your safety, but if you get a go-signal, then you are up for an exciting adventure ahead.
If you are not adventurous, the best thing to do during the monsoon is to relax and enjoy the rain while reading your favourite book. You may also go to a cafe and read there. There are several nice cafes and coffee shops across Thamel and Patan where you may unwind for a few hours. Order some tea or coffee, have some lunch and read that book you have been meaning to read for three months.
Many of them also sell Nepal-related literature, so if you do not have your book, you can borrow them too. Otherwise, bring your laptop and make use of the free wifi available at many cafés to finally look through your holiday photographs and catch up with your friends.
It is tough to play football in the summer heat and winter has its issue with making many inactive, making them choose to sleep or rest rather than play. But, monsoon is the time of year suitable for a nice game of football, even in the rain. Nothing beats a mud splash when kicking a ball or being surrounded by nature. Many Nepali youngsters have probably participated in this sport while it is raining. A very nostalgic experience for many. But, if you have not done so, you are losing out on the best event of your life.
Trekking to the Everest base camp is one of Nepal’s most famous treks, and it is a journey you will never forget. July marks the start of the summer monsoon season and the end of the trekking season in Nepal. As a result, the Everest base camp trek paths are least busy this season. And, the best sights will be when the rain has stopped.
For tranquillity seekers, the Everest base camp hike in July is the ideal option. The 14-day journey is filled with breathtaking scenery and various delights along the route. There will be various lodges and motels along the journey, so lodging and eating will never be an issue. With porters that you can hire, you can get assistance to carry your bags too.
In recent years, Nepal’s fastest-growing sport has emerged as a major tourist attraction. Exploring dirt roads, going through lush forests, soaking in the beauty and experiencing an adrenaline rush is among the most exhilarating activities available in the nation.
Mountain biking is a popular pastime in and around the capital valley, especially at Shivapuri National Park, Lele valley, Lakuri Bhanjyang, Dhulikhel, Pharping, and Kulekhani. Mountain bike adventures such as Lower Mustang mountain riding, Upper Mustang mountain biking, Annapurna circuit mountain biking, lower Everest area mountain biking, and others are popular alternatives for a week-long adventure, with lengths ranging from five to 21 days. You may wander through the city, taking in the region’s beautiful surroundings as well as its distinct culture and traditions.
Many people believe the monsoon is not the best time for cycling. But, as Cycle City Network organises Kora, a reverred cycling event every year, Nepalis and foreigners can participate and cycle around different destinations to enjoy the rainy season. The organisers say they want to promote the idea that cycling indeed is possible and fun during this season also.
Another exhilarating activity that adrenaline junkies will appreciate throughout their vacation is paragliding. Travellers can truly appreciate the spectacular aerial view of the Himalayas and the pristine blue lakes, which is one of the country’s most famous things to do. After soaking in the breathtaking scenery from above, the paragliders may relax by sitting by the lake. The setting is attractive and may be used for both relaxed vacations and exciting activities.
Poonhill trekking is an excellent monsoon/summer hike and is a reasonably short trip (seven to nine days) in Nepal’s famed Annapurna area. Even though the region receives ample rainfall throughout the monsoon season, trekking is viable. To begin with, the hike is very straightforward, and there are lots of guesthouses and teahouses along the way.
Apparently, the pathway can be obstructed due to floods and landslides. Yet, if you are for adventure, you should not miss an opportunity.
After the clouds clear, you can still enjoy the panoramic vista of the Annapurna mountains, including others from Poonhill. The area is also densely forested. For those interested in botany, the monsoon season is the best time to hike the Ghorepani-Poonhill path. Another noteworthy feature is the spectacular view of the Milkyway strip and shooting stars from Ghorepani on your way to Poonhill for the dawn during the summer.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/best-fun-monsoon-activities-in-nepal.html,travel

The weather station on Everest peak elevates the confidence of Nepali climbers and meteorologists alike,"Monday, June 13, 2022","On a cold, windy morning of May 9, a team of Nepali climbers led by Tenzing Gyalzen Sherpa reached Bishop’s rock, a slab of rock just below the summit of Everest. With him were 14 other climbers from in and around the Khumbu region. Unlike regular summits, they were there for a specific purpose — to set up a weather station just below the summit of Mount Everest at an altitude of 8,810 metres.
The weather was supposed to clear with low winds. But, it became clear as they ascended from camp 4 that this was not the case. High winds made it difficult for them to move as quickly as they wanted, and it was clear by the time they arrived at Bishop’s rock that the task ahead would be difficult.
In the spring of 2019, most of them had climbed up to the balcony, to set up a high-tech weather station. Even then, they had to face similar issues. But, this year, Tenzing Gyalzen Sherpa and others came prepared that guaranteed success as they hope the project will benefit not only mountaineers but Nepalis in general, and the meteorological academicians and students in particular.
“We knew that cold was going to be our biggest challenge. So we came prepared and we warmed batteries for the drill so that we could work smoothly. But, it wasn’t as easy as we expected it to be,” says Sherpa, the expedition leader who also works as an electrician in the Khumbu region.
The wind was so challenging that some of the team members were contemplating going down. There was a talk about leaving the equipment on Bishop rock and coming back. But, Sherpa was determined and he refused to return. He and a few others decided to stay and fixed the weather station.
Despite the challenges, they were successful and created a history. But, not without drama, as Sherpa says they were not able to fix a data locker, which meant that the station would not transmit information.
“Tom (Mathews) was sad and had descended, but I didn’t want to lose hope. I arranged the wire and hope it worked and when we reached camp 4 and got a radio from Baker (Perry) who told us it worked, we all jumped with joy. People had tears in their eyes,” says Sherpa.
With that, the weather station is up on Everest and is transmitting live data available for everyone to see. Through the data, climate scientists aim to study climate change and its effects in the Himalayas and also aim to help mountaineers by providing them with real-time data on what is happening high up on the mountain. With the quantitative data on wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and air pressure, they will know how rapidly the highest place on earth is changing as they aim to raise awareness among people throughout the world.
“This is frontier science as we’re pushing the limit,” says climate scientist Baker Perry, one of the leaders of the project. “There is a huge gap in our understanding of the weather in the highest place on earth so much so that we know more about the weather on Mars than the weather on the summit of Mount Everest. We hope this project changes that.”
The project started in 2019 and involves different parties and over 30 scientists. The project is undertaken by the National Geographic Society, working in partnership with Tribhuvan University and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and is funded by Rolex.
They have set up weather stations at different elevations. The first is at Phortse at an elevation of 3,810 metres. The second is at Everest base camp at an altitude of 5,315 metres; the third is a camp 2 at 6,464 metres, the fourth is on the South Col at 7,965 metres and the last is just below the summit at 8,810 metres.
In 2019, the team had set up a weather station on a place called the balcony on Everest at an altitude of 8,430 metres but that stopped transmitting on January 20, 2020, around seven months after it was installed.
“It was completely destroyed,” says Sherpa who had gone to take stock of the station in 2021. “A jetstream had broken it.”
This year’s expedition was focused on replacing the weather station on the balcony and undertaking minor repairs on the ones at base camp and camp 2.
“Yes, our main goal was to replace that station. But, with that, we also wanted to build the capacity of our Nepali team who have helped us since 2019,” says Perry.
He says as neither he nor the co-leader of this project Tom Mathews could come to Nepal on a regular basis, it was important for them to use Nepali resource persons if they wanted to maintain these stations for a long time.
Perry says while the weather stations below the South Col should stand for a long time, those on the South Col and Bishop’s rock do not have a set time as these are on extreme altitudes.
“We improved the design on the tripod and wind sensors, but since we can only test it in the Himalayas, we don’t know how long these will last,” says Perry.
One of the partners of the project is the Central Department of Hydrology and Meteorology of Tribhuvan University. The department chief Deepak Aryal says this project is very important, especially for academic purposes.
“This was purely a scientific research project that would be beneficial for students and researchers in the country to study weather, climate and the glacier,” says Aryal.
A Nepali climate scientist who works on high-altitude meteorology and glaciology, Arbindra Khadka, was also a part of the project. He says the aim of the station is mainly to contribute to high-altitude research.
“Every year, a lot of people come to the country to conduct research about climate change and the future of water in the region. These weather stations will help us study this in detail as we now have quantitative data,” says Khadka, who is pursuing his PhD in glaciology.
Perry agrees with Khadka and adds that they hope to understand what is driving the loss of the snow and ice on the mountain.
“This was totally worth the risk as it will help us study the water towers and the glaciers that help sustain a billion people downstream,” says Perry.
The weather stations have produced some interesting research. Perry says there has been research on how sunshine is affecting the glacier high up on the mountain.
“Temperatures are well below sub-zero, but the glacier is still melting. The sublimation is huge,” says Perry.
He says they are also learning that due to low humidity in the winter, the sublimation is even present during the winter even when temperatures are well below freezing.
“This shows that the highest elevation in the Himalayas may be more vulnerable to climate change than lower areas. The picture is quite glum when it comes to the climate crisis,” says Perry.
Aryal, from TU, says he hopes that due to the availability of real-time quantifiable data, policymakers can draft favourable policies. But, because Nepal’s policymakers are not visionaries, he is not too hopeful.
“People don’t take the climate crisis seriously, I hope we, at the university, can contribute to research bringing light to the issue about how bad the situation is and the policymakers take note of it,” says Aryal.
The weather station will also help the mountaineers by providing real-time data on the upper parts of the mountain. Most deaths on Everest mostly occurred due to people climbing in poor weather. Now with real-time data on the weather on camp 2, camp 4 and the summit, Perry and Khadka hope lives will be saved.
“We’re hoping this weather station makes the forecast system better because if we have continuous data, it will help hundreds of climbers who come with the hope of summitting Everest,” says Khadka.
The station on Bishop rock will also monitor the lower jetstream that will help climate scientists see changes in the global weather system.
Khadka says people are conducting research on moisture in the air around the summit and how it affects the build-up of moisture.
“Interesting research is being done with the help of these weather stations about the glacier and the cryosphere. Scientists are also looking at the weather when people are climbing Everest without the use of bottled oxygen. If the station on Bishop rock can last for a year, we can even study human physiology,” says Khadka.
With a lot of avenues for research, scientists in both Nepal and abroad hope they are able to study new aspects of climate change.
“It’s promising and we’re looking forward to working with Nepali researchers and scientists to bring more information out to the public,” says Baker.

Govt’s own panel says Nepal’s aviation safety is weak but blames airline companies for it,"Friday, June 10, 2022","Kathmandu, June 10
A committee formed by the government to look into Nepal’s aviation safety status says the country is performing poorly in the sector. It has blamed airline companies for the status.
Further, the committee says airline companies operating helicopters are more negligent than those operating aeroplanes.
The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had formed a committee on September 29, 2021, in response to the complaints galore about the sector.
Meanwhile, the committee has also highlighted that the aviation sector does not have as many personnel as it needs in Nepal, and it is poorer in the helicopter companies.

PK Sherpa: An unpromising dream leads to a promising career–at the peak of Nepal’s mountaineering industry,"Tuesday, June 7, 2022","Growing up in his village in the Sotang rural municipality in lower Solukhumbu, Pasang Kaji Sherpa (popularly known as PK Sherpa) never thought he would get into mountaineering. No one from his village had ever been a mountaineer. Most of them were into agriculture with only a few venturing out of the village becoming porters or guides for trekking groups.
That is how PK Sherpa started his journey into mountaineering. At the tender age of 13, he joined a trekking group as a porter and ventured out to make a living for himself. But deep down, he would always be looking at the mountains, hoping and dreaming that one day, he too would be on the summit of the highest peaks in the world.
In the 15 years, he has been mountaineering; he has seen a lot. There have been many ups and downs. From the horror of people dying in the mountains to the ecstasy of people summitting, his life has been nothing short of a rollercoaster.
Now, as PK Sherpa is reaching the peak of his career, he wants to inspire the younger generation of climbers by setting an example on the mountain. In doing so, he wants to continue his evolution as a mountaineer as he believes that it is a sport that has no margin of error. He hopes the government will bring in favourable policies to produce skilled mountaineers to create a favourable environment for the industry.
“Like in life, you have to evolve in the mountains too. Or else, it can be detrimental,” says Sherpa.
Getting into mountaineering was not a straightforward journey for PK Sherpa. During his time as a trekking guide, he would often come across mountaineers in the Everest region who would be partying after a successful expedition. Looking at them, he would feel envious. His inner self wanted something similar.
“Back then, I felt the life as a mountain guide was better than trekking guide when compared in terms of money and recognition. The mountain guide got it more, which is why I wanted to switch.”
So, since then, he has scaled Everest seven times.
But, he did not know where to start back then. No one from PK Sherpa’s hometown had been into mountaineering. And with no skill, he knew it would be foolish to go climbing. With that in mind, he applied to take training offered by the Nepal Mountaineering Association in 2005. But, his application was rejected. Adamant, he decided to go to the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling in India. But, he could not get in because he did not have enough money to take part in the courses the institute offered.
“It was discouraging. So I came back and took a course on becoming a trekking guide and spent a few years travelling Nepal with groups.”
In 2007, during a trekking trip to Tibet, PK Sherpa got his first taste of mountaineering when he climbed a 6,000-metre mountain with his cousins and clients. Even though he had not been to any mountain prior to this, mountaineering came naturally to him. He reached the top with relative ease, but coming down was a different story.
“I didn’t know how to come down. It was scary because one mistake would mean death and that is the day when I realised the importance of training.”
Following the trip, he came back to Nepal and took the basic and advanced mountaineering courses offered by the Nepal Mountain Instructors Association. That training gave him the confidence he could climb any mountain and later in spring, he left with his cousins for Tibet to take on the world’s highest mountain—Everest.
He did not summit that year, but he learnt a lot about how hard climbing an 8,000-metre mountain was. He saw deaths on the mountain. He saw people going crazy due to a lack of oxygen. It was there that he understood what he had chosen as a profession.
In autumn of the same year, PK Sherpa returned to Tibet to climb Cho Oyu. Even with the most basic gears, he summitted the mountain. But, he knew that he needed to train more if he was to get any better at it.
“I started to enrol myself for various courses. This was the time when I started to send my son to school. It’s funny because in a way we both were going to school,” Sherpa jokes.
In the spring of 2009, PK Sherpa went to Everest again, this time from the south side (Nepal) and reached the summit. But, that did not make him cocky or arrogant because he knew that if he wanted to do this for long, he needed to train. That is when he started to take training led by the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association. The NNMGA was on the verge of being associated with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Association and he understood what this would mean.
“Being an international mountain guide meant you would get better opportunities. That’s not it, the training that I took made me a better climber. I can get out of tough spots and rescue my client too.”
During his bid to become an internationally recognised guide, he worked with foreign companies learning the basics of mountaineering and how to conduct a safe expedition. Sherpa says he saw how much these people focused on safety. They also had a calorie guide and asked each client and support staff to maintain it. “I was impressed with the attention to detail they have during their expedition.”
During this time, PK Sherpa also met mountaineer, filmmaker and photographer Elia Saikaly, who has been his climbing partner ever since. Working with him, he started to get into photography too.
“I was already interested, but working with him I started to enjoy it more. I would take my camera on every expedition. It’s turned into a passion now,” says Sherpa.
Following the completion of his IFMGA training, he got better opportunities too. He guided multiple foreign expeditions to the top of Everest and also worked with a team from Google. But, he always craved for more. In 2015, the year of the earthquake, he and a few others were planning to climb six mountains in a season, but things did not go as planned. He had also planned to climb two unclimbed peaks, Hillary and Tenzing, but due to poor weather and other circumstances, he had to call off the bid.
“It was still a great experience because I didn’t climb as a guide. I climbed the mountain like a mountaineer. But, it was hard because the soft snow on the mountain made it dangerous to climb,” PK Sherpa says.
But, it was still worth it as he climbed a mountain for the first time as a climber. He says that this is what he likes about Nepalis nowadays. He feels the increased number of people attracted to climbing is good for the sport. But that said, he does feel the government needs to do more to create an environment for this.
PK Sherpa says the Sherpa community cannot sustain the industry on its own, adding he likes that more people from other communities have started to work as guides on the mountain. But, he does say that due to nepotism, things are not as smooth for them.
“Like everywhere, nepotism is rampant in the mountaineering industry too.”
But, PK Sherpa says this is not a problem right now. The problem is the government is not active in producing high-quality mountain guides. He feels the government should spend the royalty it gets from mountains like Everest and invest it in the climbers and develop high-quality guides.
“The government was handing out mountain guide licences to anyone, but what they should do is spend the money to develop people’s capacity because we don’t have enough skilled people on the mountains,” says Sherpa.
“This would mean that we would earn more. If Nepal had better guides, people will use our service instead of foreign ones. That would mean more money stays in our economy. The government needs to think beyond the 11,000 USD it gets as royalty if they don’t, things will remain the same.”
PK Sherpa also urges the government to change its archaic mindset and promote different activities that take place in the mountain. He says the government should be strict on the regulation of these activities and promote things like skiing and paragliding.
“What the government did to Sano Babu Sunuwar and Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa was wrong,” he says pointing out to the two being arrested after paragliding from Everest in 2011.“ They had tried everything, but the government did not help and they both said to hell with this and paraglided off.”
PK Sherpa feels the government needs to understand what can and cannot be done on the mountain. He says it was time the country evolved because if it did not, it would be too late.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/pk-sherpa-nepal-mountaineer.html,travel

"Impossible to have 2 pilots on single-engine helicopters, operators tell CAAN","Friday, June 3, 2022","Kathmandu, June 3
The Airline Operators Association of Nepal has stated that it is impossible to implement the decision of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) to have two pilots on a single-engine helicopter.
CAAN had suggested that even single-engine helicopters should have two pilots, but the operators say it is not practical to have two pilots on commercial flights.

"Biggest, craziest and saddest: 10 things you need to know about 69 years of Everest summit","Sunday, May 29, 2022","On May 29, 1953, history was created. Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary were able to achieve a first for humankind. Battling many odds, the two reached the highest point on earth. Since then, many have tried. It would not be wrong to call Everest an obsession.
People from all across the globe have started to come and reach the summit. They come to smash old records and create new ones. Some come to raise awareness about certain issues while some do it to prove something to themselves or others who doubted them.
Since 1953, about 4,000 people have climbed the mountain. The mountain has seen both highs and lows. People have had moments of absolute ecstasy while horrible things have happened on the mountain leaving people thinking if climbing is worth it at all.
Today, on Everest Day, we look at some of the most significant achievements on the mountain.
Talking about Everest today is incomplete without talking about Kami Rita Sherpa. The climber and guide from Thame in Solukhumbu has reached the summit of the mountain 26 times. Each year, the 52-year-old breaks his own record. In recent times, Kami Rita Sherpa has become a celebrity at the base camp as hundreds of climbers come to learn things about the mountain from the record holder.
Similarly, Lhakpa Sherpa became the only woman to climb the mountain 10 times.
Another person in a league of his own is Ang Rita Sherpa who climbed Everest 10 times without bottled oxygen between 1983 and 1996. He died in September 2020.
Babu Chhiri Sherpa did something no one had dreamt of. In 1999, the maverick Nepali climber spent 21 hours on the summit of Mount Everest without the support of bottled oxygen. He even pitched a tent on the summit, the only one to ever do so.
Junko Tabei of Japan became the first woman to reach the summit of Everest breaking stereotypes and creating a space for women in the field of mountaineering. She was part of a 15-woman Japanese team that was on the mountain. Due to logistical issues, their support team could only carry oxygen enough for one woman. Tabei stepped up and created history. Following her footsteps, many women have attempted and climbed Everest. A source of inspiration for all…
The fastest to climb Everest is Lhakpa Gelu Sherpa who took 10 hours 56 minutes to climb the mountain from the base camp.
The thought of climbing beyond 8,000 m or what they call the death zone was unthinkable until Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler in 1978 climbed Everest without the help of bottled oxygen. A year later, Messner returned as he climbed Everest, solo, without the use of oxygen. Messner, who has done some crazy stuff, said it was the hardest thing he has ever done.
Yuichiro Miura, at 80, became the oldest person to reach the top of the world in 2013. The record was held by Nepali Min Bahadur Sherchan previously.
Likewise, Tamae Watanabe aged 72 in 2013 had become the oldest woman to climb Everest.
Mark Inglis in May 2006 did something not many thought was possible. A double amputee, he showed the world what hard work and a positive mindset could do as he became the first double amputee to reach the top of Everest. Arunima Sinha from India became the world’s first female amputee to climb Everest.
Climbers usually wear layers and layers of clothes before going up Everest. But in 2007, Dutch national Wim Hof climbed to an altitude of 7,400 metres on Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts and shoes but aborted the attempt due to a recurring foot injury. He managed to climb from base camp to about 6,700 metres (22,000 ft) wearing just shorts and sandals, but after that, he had to wear boots.
In another weird for Everest, Lhakpa Tharke Sherpa did the first to strip butt naked on the summit of Everest in 2006. What does not kill you only makes you stronger!
The mountain has seen some tragedies since commercialisation began. The first major accident took place in 1922 when seven Nepali climbers assisting the British expedition perished after getting swept by an avalanche. In 1970, six Nepali support staff for a Japanese expedition were swept away by an avalanche on the Khumbu icefall. In the 1996 disaster, six people died, including two expedition leaders. With a shorter weather window, this showed how overcrowding could have been a problem. In 2014, an avalanche swept away a team of Nepali climbers on the Khumbu icefall again; 16 people died. More recently, 2015 was another bad year for Everest. The 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche on Pumori swept the base camp and killed 22 people.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/biggest-craziest-saddest-everest.html,travel
Everest Day: Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in his grandson’s memory,"Sunday, May 29, 2022","When Tashi Wangchuk Tenzing Sherpa began accompanying Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, his sexagenarian grandfather (mother Pem Pem’s father), on a trek to the Everest Base Camp along with many foreign climbers, he did not know who the old man was.
Tenzing Norgay Sherpa was just a ‘baaje’ (granddad) for Tashi; but this carefree teen used to wonder why other people in the trekking group would give the old man the highest possible love and respect.
Gradually, Tashi recognised that he was not any other grandpa as his mother told him stories about the struggles and successes of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, the first person to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, 12 years before Tashi’s birth.
“My baaje was already a hero for the world. Later, when I learned about what sorrows and sufferings he faced in his life and how he coped with them just to keep his family happy, I could not control myself from bursting into tears,” he shares, “This is how he became my biggest hero and truest inspiration.”
Tashi, the ‘heir apparent’ of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa’s legacy, feels that his granddad’s contribution to Nepal’s fame in the world is not only unprecedented but imperishable too.
Tashi later learned that Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, born in the Khumbu region of Nepal in the bosom of Mount Everest in 1914, migrated to Darjeeling of India at the age of 18.
“Living in Solukhumbu was too tough then. No crop would grow except potatoes, and that would also be insufficient,” he recounts what he came to know from his mother, “Nepal did not open the door of its mountains to foreign climbers until 1951; therefore Sherpas there would not find any job. Later they came to know that mountaineering activities were thriving in Tibet and began migrating to Darjeeling so they could find jobs to assist expeditions from there.”
Then, only a few families continued to stay in the Khumbu region as just around five to 10 houses were there in Namche Bazaar then. Across the border, Nepali Sherpas had established their own village named Tungsung in Darjeeling, which other people would call Zigzag Road.
Tenzing Norgay Sherpa also joined multiple foreign expeditions to Everest from the Tibetan side after he migrated to Darjeeling. It took him around 20 more years to conquer the top of the world as a part of the British expedition. Though all members of the big team could not reach the peak, two persons including Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and New Zealander Edmund Hilary set the world record by successfully climbing Everest, for the first time in history.
“My baaje’s record is not only the first, it will last forever as there will not be the third person (after Tenzing Norgay and Hilary) to climb Everest as the first climber,” Tashi proudly shares, “This event is not only important for his personal fame but for the overall identify of Nepal. You know there were many people who never heard of Nepal by then, but came to know that a Nepali Sherpa successfully climbed Mount Everest.”
The apparent heir’s claim does not amount to exaggeration, at least for one reason: even today, there are thousands of people in the world who have not heard of Nepal but know that Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world.
Therefore, Tashi thinks that the Nepal government should officially celebrate May 29 as Everest Day or Tenzing Norgay Day. Whereas the government has recently trimmed its public holiday list, he says the state needs to declare the day as a public holiday and organise a multitude of activities from local to international levels.
“I wish the government took some serious initiatives to acknowledge my grandfather’s contribution. From my side, I will also continue my efforts to keep his name bright and shining as much as I can.”
“Many records have been made on Everest after my granddad’s ascent, but most of them have already been broken and forgotten,” he says, “This is the only record on Everest that cannot be broken and a Nepali holds it. No one should forget this.”
But, sometimes, Tashi Sherpa gets irritated with comments that the Nepal government does not owe any tribute to Tenzing Norgay Sherpa as he was an Indian citizen. But, he thinks that this controversy is useless.
“If you really understand history, you will know that my baaje went to Darjeeling just to save his life and family. Because his relatives were also living there, he built his house there and acquired Indian citizenship,” he clarifies, “It was not only Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, but thousands of people from hills of Nepal had not acquired citizenship certificates as they did not need them. So no one should go after the fact that he did not have Nepali citizenship.”
“Given that he put the flag of Nepal on the top of the world, please tell me why citizenship is still an issue.”
Further, he says, “After the summit too, he used to frequently come to Kathmandu. If our government had really wanted it, it could have convinced him to stay in Nepal; he could have changed the decision. This is what India and its Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did for our granddad.”
Tashi claims that Tenzing Norgay Sherpa had passports from both Nepal and India when he visited British Queen Elizabeth II after the summit.
Further, if the Nepali leadership really wished to own Tenzing Norgay’s contribution, it could have given the honorary citizenship to him, he suggests. “If Edmund Hilary got the honorary citizenship of Nepal, there is no question that Tenzing Norgay cannot be a Nepali.”
“Bureaucrats here should have explored options to own and cash in on his contribution, but in fact, they just tried to find how he can be made a non-Nepali,” Tashi sounds quite emotional as he wraps up the talk about the citizenship debate, “Your love to your motherland comes from your heart and soul, not from a piece of paper called citizenship. We should be proud to regard Tenzing Norgay as a Nepali.”
However, Tashi is happy that Tenzing Norgay has been conferred the Nepal Tara, one of the most prestigious medals awarded by the government of Nepal.
Recognising Tenzing Norgay Sherpa as a Nepali is just one side of the story, believes Tashi Sherpa. He thinks that there are many things that the government needs to do so as to give due respect to his contribution.
“Whereas Everest itself is a goddess for the Sherpa people, it is a priceless gift the god sent to Nepal and its people. It has to be conserved, respectfully.”
With respect to the goddess, Tashi Sherpa means that haphazard climbing activities should be controlled on Everest. For example, some climbers have recently used helicopters and drones to reach upper camps before climbing. It has to be stopped. “Climbing means climbing; you have to walk on your foot from the very bottom,” views the multi-time Everest summiteer.
Likewise, he suggests that the mountain should be kept clean. As the Nepal government collects hefty fees from the climbers, it should be able to offer a clean environment to them. For that, according to him, strict policies and rules should be adopted and effectively implemented.
“In 2017, I was in North America to summit Mount Denali and they did not let us throw anything in the region. There were no coolies, no Sherpas; we had to carry all the bags on our own. We had to clean up everything,” he remembers, “This is what real mountaineering is. This is real adventure and fun.”
—
Tenzing Norgay Sherpa died when Tashi was 21. He was a bachelor’s in arts student at Delhi University and the final year examinations were ongoing when the baaje was on his deathbed in Darjeeling. Tashi could not see Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in his last days. Perhaps, this is why he always felt that the legendary mountaineer’s wishes could not be fulfilled.
“He had a wish to visit Chitral, where his first wife and my grandmother died, and I had told him that I would give him company,” Tashi remembers, “I could never go to Chitral. I could never give him company sufficiently as long as he lived.”
Perhaps this failure inspired him to take over the role of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa’s successor, and make the towering figure’s personality even taller.
“History does not repeat itself. That is why I will work to keep the history alive.”

Nepal mountaineering season 2022: Summary of events and incidents from mid-March to early May,"Tuesday, May 10, 2022","Kami Rita Sherpa and his team reached the top of Everest on May 7, opening the route for the 300 odd people who have taken a permit to climb Everest this season. This summit, like every other year, (un)officially marked the start of the mountaineering season.
But, Nepal’s mountaineering season, which started around mid-March, has already seen a lot. There have been summits on Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Kanchenjunga; climbers have gone missing; people have died and climbers have created records.
So what has happened up to now? Let’s take a look.
The first summit of the season on an 8000er was on Dhaulagiri when Mingma G led his team to scale the seventh highest mountain in the world. Blessed with a great weather window, their summit attempt was quite smooth as 10 international climbers and 12 Nepali climbers reached the summit.
After Dhaulagiri, Annapurna saw a host of climbers reach the top too. On April 28, around 30 people reached the summit of the mountain, most notably Adriana Brownlee and Grace Tseng. The latter did not use oxygen during her summit bid. There were other women too who climbed Annapurna. Baibanou Bouchra from Morroco, Kasturi Deepak Savekar from India, Olga Koroleva from Russia, Allie Pepper from Australia and Kristin Harila from Norway reached the summit of the mountain as women dominated the climb on Annapurna I. Harlia also climbed Dhaulagiri on May 8.
Along with Tseng, Hans Wenzl, Tim Bogdanov and Giampaolo Corona also did not use supplemental oxygen and climbed the mountain ‘alpine style’, informs Chhang Dawa Sherpa from Seven Summit Treks. Bogdanov and Corona lost contact with the Seven Summit Treks team when they descended off a new route but were later rescued off the mountain using a helicopter. Both are alive and well and have been treated for frostbite.
Kanchenjunga saw a host of summits on the mountain on May 5 as around 40 people reached the summit. Most of the climbers who reached the summit were from India. Pakistan’s wonder kid Shehroze Kashif also stood atop the mountain along with Sirbaz Ali Khan, who became the first-ever Pakistani to climb 10 of the world’s 14 highest peaks. Nepali photojournalist Purnima Shrestha also reached the summit of Kanchenjunga making it her 6th 8000-er.
Mingma G and his team, who turned back from the mountain a week ago, also reached the summit on May 7. Nepal Army personnel Raju Shrestha and Amit Thapa also reached the summit becoming Nepal’s first army personnel to summit the mountain.
Qatari princess Asma Al Thani also reached the summit of Kanchenjunga with Nirmal Purja and a team of highly experienced climbers. She is in Nepal to climb Everest and Lhotse, but with time to kill, she headed to Kanchenjunga with Purja and became the first Arab to climb the third highest mountain in the world. But, some are questioning if it can be called a true summit as Al Thani wrote they started their summit bid from Camp 2. Pujra, however, says they started from base camp.
In other news, there has also been summit success on Makalu. Adran Ballinger from Alpenglow Expedition has successfully skied off the mountain as the mountain say many summits on May 9.
In life, death is inevitable, but on the mountains, the risk of dying is extremely high. Take the example of Antonios Sykaris. The experienced Greek Alpinist died on Dhaulagiri on April 12 during the descent of the mountain, shocking the mountaineering world. While he was showered with tributes, the death of Nepali, Nima Tenji Sherpa from Waku, Solukhumbu, went under the radar. Nima Tenji died in the dangerous Khumbu icefall. The reason for his death is still unknown.
Kanchenjunga also saw one casualty. Narayan Iyer, from India, died on Kanchenjunga while ascending the mountain. There are reports that his expedition outfit, Pioneer Adventures, after seeing he was ill, asked him to descend, but Iyer refused and died on the mountain.
Reports have also emerged about Russian climber Pavel Kostrikin dying on Everest due to acute mountain sickness.
A Nepali climber has gone missing on the Lhotse’s South Face. Khudam Bir Tamang, part of Hong Sung Taek’s team, got swept by an avalanche. There have been rescue attempts but it is likely that Tamang has been forever lost in the mountain.
There are people still on Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga waiting for the right window. Carlos Sori, 83, is still on Dhaulagiri trying to summit the mountain. This is his 13th attempt to climb the mountain. A team of Nepali climbers from Seven Summit Treks are with him on the mountain. Billi Bierling, from the Himalayan Database, is also on the mountain aiming for the summit.
Things are moving forward on Makalu as the fixing team has almost reached the summit. There are teams from Seven Summit Treks, Alpenglow Expeditions and Pioneer Adventures.
Kanchenjunga also has a few teams on the mountain, most of whom are clients from Seven Summit Treks.
The most abuzz place during the mountaineering season is the Everest base camp. After Kami Rita and the team fixed ropes to the summit, a certain buzz can be seen at the base camp. A few teams of acclimatised climbers are already on their way up the mountain trying to beat the traffic. Climbers who had descended down the mountain to Namche Bazar and Pheriche are on their way up to base camp with the aim to fulfil their lifelong dream of reaching the highest point on earth.
Chronicler Alan Arnett last week spoke to three weather experts who said the mountaineering season is expected to be dryer than in the last couple of years with fewer winds than usual. Arnett himself feels this mountaineering season might be similar to 2018 when there were 11 days of great weather, which meant a total of 802 summits were recorded on both sides of Everest. This is good news for those climbing Makalu and Lhotse too.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-mountaineering-season-summary.html,travel

"Hari Budha Magar: With the Everest summit, the double amputee is all set to break the stigma","Wednesday, May 4, 2022","Skydiving out of a helicopter in the Khumbu region, Hari Budha Magar had one thing on his mind – Everest. Since 2016, Everest has been his dream as he wanted to become the first above-the-knee double amputee to climb the highest mountain on earth.
Over the course of these six years, he has faced multiple setbacks. Firstly, the Nepal government barred double amputees and blind climbers from the mountain. Then, Covid happened, which meant his sponsor pulled out of the project due to financial reasons.
But now, the former British Gurkha and a war veteran has left all that behind as he sets his sight on climbing Everest in 2023 aiming to inspire differently-abled people from all across the globe and prove a point that if given the right opportunity, even they could break the stigma and do wonders.
“I had no mentors or people to look up to when I lost my legs. I want to change that. I want to show people like me that they should not consider quitting on life because there is a lot more than they can do with it,” says Hari Budha Magar.
Hari Budha Magar grew up in the remote village of Mirul in Rolpa in 1979. The place was so remote that they had to walk a week to Ghorahi to buy basic amenities.
“I had a tough childhood. I was born in a shed, walked to school barefoot, wore torn clothes and wrote on stone sledges,” says Magar, adding he was always fascinated by Dhaulagiri that could be seen from this village.
As a child, he was stubborn. When people told him he could not do a particular thing, he would work tirelessly to prove them wrong. That is what made him the first person in his village to pass the final school exam.
“I then joined the British Gurkha and my life changed.”
Hari Budha Magar started his career in the British Gurkha in 1999 and gave the prime of his life to the English government. He was deployed all over the place and was at the peak of his career. Then, one day, everything changed.
“I was in Afghanistan when I stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) and my life changed in 2010,” he says.
Hari Budha Magar felt his life was over and he would die but was airlifted to a nearby base. He survived, but to his horror, he lost both his legs and had scars all over his body.
“I was at the peak of my career. When I recall that incident, I become teary. Never in my life had I thought I would lose my legs.”
That took him to a dark place. Irritated by all the pity he was getting, he started to drink heavily. Depressed, he even considered taking his own life.
“But, then, I remembered what it would do to my family. It would’ve broken them.”
That gave him the motivation to get his life together. To distract his mind, he started to take part in sports. He took part in almost all sports that were listed in the Paralympics. Taking part in sporting activities gave him confidence. He started to take part in adventure sports too.
“That is when I felt, if you do something worthwhile physically, it will help you mentally too. I realised that it was my second life and wanted to live a positive life.”
Hari Budha Magar says if he knew this earlier, he would not have suffered so much.
“I went through hell because I was unaware of how there were things that I could do. Once I started to get involved in sports and adventure activities, it helped me move on quickly. This is why I want to climb mountains and show the differently-abled people that they can do it too if they put their mind to it,” he says.
It was around 2013 that Hari Budha Magar started to dream about climbing mountains too. A team of army personnel from the British Gurkhas were climbing Everest. And he started talking to Krishna Thapa Magar, the team leader of the Gurkha expedition.
“He came up to me and told me that he wanted to climb too. So in 2016, we came to Kathmandu,” says Krishna. “I didn’t want to judge him. I wanted to give him the confidence and opportunity to fulfil his dream.”
The two came to Nepal and went to Gosaikunda and Annapurna Circuit to check how Hari’s body adapted to high altitude. Happy with his progress, they also climbed Mera Peak.
“I became the first above-the-knee double amputee to climb a mountain over 6,000 metres. I can’t explain how happy I was. I had tears in my eyes. I felt reborn,” says Hari Budha Magar.
Following that, he started to work towards getting to Everest, but then the government, in 2017, barred double amputees from the mountain. He had everything in place to climb Everest in 2018, but as he spent most of the year in a legal battle, his Everest dream was nothing but a dream.
“It was wrong of the government to say that. They cannot tell someone they can’t climb. It’s one’s personal choice. It wasn’t just my fight. It was a fight for everyone,” he says.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed the government’s decision to the delight of many amputee adventurers.
“It was a win for everyone,” says Hari Budha Magar.
Now that everything is settled, he has set his sights on Everest again. In April, he became the first above-the-knee double amputee to hike all the way to the base camp. A week later, he was on a helicopter, sky diving into the shut Syangboche Airport.
“The sky diving was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It felt great as did the trek to basecamp. I can’t wait to be back,” says Hari Budha Magar.
But, Everest is going to be tough. Only two amputees, both below the knee, have climbed Everest the recent being Chinese climber Xia Boyu in 2018.
“I’ve been talking to Mark Inglis who was the first amputee to climb Everest. He’s been mentoring me on what to expect on the mountain and I’ve been training accordingly,” he says.
Krishna Thapa Magar says that there are going to be many challenges, which is why they will try and get to Nepal during the autumn and climb at least one 7,000-metre mountain.
“We want to see what we need to do to make this as smooth as possible. Hari is very strong, but there will be challenges in some parts of the mountain. That is why we might have to spend a long time and set up a lot more camps,” says Krishna Thapa Magar.
Hari Budha Magar knows it is going to be challenging. He is not worried about climbing steep slopes. What he is dreading are long days that he will have to walk.
“Since my prosthetic climbing legs are short, I will be very slow and that means I will have to carry a lot more resources up the mountain,” he says.
That is why he needs a lot of funding. He says it is going to cost him around USD 300,000 to climb Everest and he is extremely thankful for the people who have helped him so far.
“Funding was hard because we don’t really learn how to do that. I grew up in a remote village. Who will teach me how to crowdfund? But, I’ve learnt a lot over the past few years,” he says.
At the end of the day, Hari Budha Magar wants to create positive change in society. Climbing Everest is just the tip of the iceberg. He wants to do more. He wants to end the stigma surrounding differently-abled people in Nepal and around the world.
“We need to do so much in Nepal for differently-abled people. From poor roads to poor policies, a lot needs to change. I also want to show people that we need to give these people the opportunity to get their life back together. If I am able to do this, I think I will have served my purpose.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-budha-magar-everest-dream.html,travel

Nepal progresses in ICAO air safety audit,"Tuesday, April 26, 2022","Kathmandu, April 26
Nepal’s air safety rating has increased as per the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) safety audit.
The Nepal Air Safety Audit team as per its preliminary policy has been able to keep the total compliance rate to 70.1 per cent with a rise of three per cent from the earlier score.
At a press conference organised here Monday, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) shared that Nepal’s compliance rate is above the average in ICAO’s air safety audit.
On the occasion, CAAN Director-General Pradeep Adhikari said Nepal had been able to impart a message that its sky is safe by increasing the safety audit score by three per cent than before.
Yet, the European Commission-imposed air restriction on Nepali airlines’ flights has not been lifted despite its rise in the safety rating of the ICAO audit. The CAAN believes that this progress would surely help Nepal in the coming days.

Over 300 are climbing Everest this season as Nepal approves 876 to climb 25 peaks,"Monday, April 25, 2022","Kathmandu, April 25
The government of Nepal says it has issued over 300 climbing permits for Everest this mountaineering season. The number may increase as new applications are coming in, according to officials.
Whereas earlier projections had shown the highest peak of the world will be quieter this year, the number is gradually increasing. Yet, it is still less than the applications received last year (over 400). That year, however, the number of successful summits was too few as the season was affected by the Covid pandemic.

Ranikot: The right choice for camping inside Kathmandu,"Saturday, April 23, 2022","Last week, when we were looking for a place for camping inside/nearby Kathmandu, one of my friends found a place called Panorama View Tower Resort on the internet. The resort is located at Ranikot, situated about 2,000 metres above sea level near the border of Bhaktapur, Lalitpur and Kavre.
According to Google Maps, it was not much farther than our location, and some of its photos available on the internet also intrigued us. So, we immediately decided to go there. It was just 16.2 Km away from Koteshwar.
And, our experience there that night proved Ranikot was the right choice for our camping.
The easiest way to reach Ranikot is via Suryabinayak of Bhaktapur. Take a left turn at the Suryabinayak Ganesh temple and go upward. After several turns through the forest area, the famous Pilot Baba Ashram on your right, you reach Ghyampe Danda. Move along the road and you reach Ranikot in a few minutes.
It was already twilight when we left for the resort. We, the group of seven, went there on two-wheelers.
Most of the roads are well-pitched, but the section some 15 minutes ahead of the destination is in a bad condition. The section is quite bumpy and extremely dusty. Hence, do not forget to take a mask, goggles and scarf that would cover you from dust.
Similarly, if you are going there on a  scooter, prefer riding it single because sometimes due to the road condition, the vehicle can be unable to bear the two riders. If you are two, the pillion rider might have to volunteer to walk some hundred metres.
When we reached there, the resort welcomed us very warmly. It served us delicious food items in the welcome snack. It included veg pakoda, bhatmas sandheko (spiced soya beans), gundruk sandheko (fermented green leaves spiced), French fries and masala tea.
After half an hour, we started a BBQ session. There is a nice space to do it. Thanks to the resort for serving us well-marinated meat, we continued BBQ till the wee hours.
Despite it being very late, the resort served us dinner very warmly. And, the dinner was also equally delicious.
Afterwards, we went to our tent. It was well-managed and comfortable to sleep in. The resort has altogether 10 tents, each of them has a capacity of six people.
By the way, if you want to stay in a room instead of a tent, there is a facility for it as well.
Since we reached the resort in the evening, we could not see the scene around Ranikot. But, the next morning, all of us were surprised.  The landscape that was seen immediately outside our tent was very beautiful and refreshing.
With that, the trees and flowers at the resort in Ranikot have made its entire surroundings pleasing. There you can also hear the melodious chirps of different birds.
The resort surrounded around 6.29 acres (50 ropanis) has its own vegetation and farm for local chicken breeds and other aves.
The resort is quite affordable. The one-night package costs Rs 1,750 per person. The package includes welcome snacks, lodging, dinner and breakfast.
Overall, Panorama View Tower Resort, as well as Ranikot, is a very nice escape for someone who would like to stay camped for a night, in nearby Kathmandu. The only thing that might disappoint some visitors is the place does not have a proper mobile network and strong broadband connections.

Hong Sung Taek: All the way from South Korea to break the Lhotse south face impasse in Nepal,"Saturday, April 16, 2022","Climbing the Lhotse south face has been in South Korean climber Hong Sung Taek’s mind for over two decades. What started as a dream in 1999 has now turned into an obsession as he is back in Kathmandu this mountaineering season, preparing to make his seventh attempt at climbing the south face of Lhotse which has not been climbed since 1990.
“The wall on this mountain has tested me both mentally and physically. But, I know that I can do this and I believe the team I’ve assembled will be able to do something that’s not been done in 30 years,” says Hong.
Hong knows it is not going to be easy. He is aware of how brutal the 3,200-metre vertical wall of the Lhotse south face is. The wall, which has an average slope of 75 degrees, has only been successfully climbed once by Russians Serguey Bershov and Vladimir Karataev in 1990. Prior to that, legends like Jerzy Kukuczka and Reinhold Messner have tried and failed to reach the summit. Kukuczka lost his life on the mountain.
But, despite the risk at hand, Hong seems more determined than ever. To him, doing this route will be nothing short of remarkable. Taking all other attempts in mind, he seems positive. ملاعب كاس العالم 2022 He has assembled a team of strong climbers from Korea, Spain and France as he aims to recreate history.
His first attempt on the mountain was in 1999. Having climbed Shishapangma and Everest, he set his sights on Lhotse. But, he did not want to do the normal route.
“I was young and wanted to prove a point to myself. But, due to lack of experience and know-how about the mountain, I was only able to get to around 7,000 metres,” says Hong.
A lack of human resources also played a part in 1999. But he did not give up his dream and came back in 2007. That year, he reached the Lhotse Shar with a team of strong Korean team led by Um Hong Gil.
“The project was different then,” he says.
By 2013, the Lhotse south face had become his obsession. He was really confident as he had reached all the Three Poles. He climbed Everest in 1995 from the Tibetan side while he skied to the South Pole in 1994 and walked to the North Pole in 2005. Hong also crossed the Bering Strait and Greenland for the first time. He was on a roll, but the Lhotse south face still eluded him.
He came back in 2013 and failed. كازينو اون لاين 888 He returned in 2014 but failed again. He faced the same fate in 2015.
“It is discouraging. The weather is completely different on this side of the mountain and it’s frustrating,” says Hong.
After a hiatus of a few years, he returned in 2019. He was certain that after all these years of not reaching the summit, he had a chance to make a win over the Lhotse south face. He was less than 300 metres from reaching the summit, but harsh winds stopped his summit bid.
“It was hard. I was sobbing and praying in the white moonlight of the Lhotse south face to go to the top. The weather didn’t want me to climb,” he told Explorer Web.
During that summit bid, he battled avalanches and the sheer verticality of the 3,300m wall and managed to reach 8,200m. All he needed was 72 hours of decent weather, but it was like the mountain did not want him to climb. The winds got stronger and the snow was continuous.
“I knew I had to go back down and come back again,” he says. لعبة كازينو
He was disappointed but the stubborn man he is, he is back. Fitter than ever, he has assembled a team of eighth climbers who will help him during the Lhotse south face journey. Joining him are Nakjong Seong, Jae Chul Kim and Jorge Egoxheraga Rodriguez who have been with him on the mountain previously. Apart from them, his team also has Frech alpinist Vadim Primin Druelle and Koreans Myung Suk Koh, Byoung Tae and Jupil Park.
“The team is strong and determined. Everyone is driving,” he says.
Rodriguez who joined him in 2015 and 2017 says he is looking forward to going back to the Lhotse south face.
“What makes it a tough climb is this side of the mountain is very technical. It pushes you to the limit because you have to climb from the first step. The weather on this side is very unpredictable too and since there aren’t many platforms to pitch tents, we have to work extra hard here,” says Rodriguez, who has climbed all 14 eight thousand-metre peaks in the world.
Rodriguez says that even though they have been on the mountain, they still cannot prepare for the Lhotse south face as the condition on the mountain changes every year. And to successfully climb the mountain, they need everything to work in their favour.
“We need all factors, the weather, snow conditions and wind to help us,” he says.
Druelle, however, is excited about the Lhotse south face climb. He knows there are risks in climbing such a tough wall, but he knows that with teamwork, it is possible.
“I am scared. I think it’s better to be scared because it keeps you on your toes. That said, I believe we can do it,” says Druelle.
This is the confidence Hong needs. He believes that the team has advanced climbing techniques that will come in handy during the climb.
“The Lhotse south face is another great Himalayan adventure that has eluded many mountaineers and with help of my team and Nepali support staff, I hope I can achieve it,” says Hong.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hong-sung-taek-lhotse-south-face.html,travel

Krishna Thapa and his dream to develop skiing as a new adventure sport in Nepal,"Sunday, April 3, 2022","The snowy slopes around Mardi Himal saw something very different this year. Usually full of domestic tourists, this winter, it saw a crowd that was there for more than just sightseeing.
Around 25 people were gathered. Some were travel guides while some worked in the mountains. They were there for one thing – learning the basics of skiing at the Great Himalayan Ski Visit from one of the best in the trade, Krishna Thapa.
“It’s good to see people are interested. If done right, skiing can be huge in Nepal because there are so many places it can be done,” says Krishna Thapa, an internationally recognised ski instructor.
Krishna Thapa has been in the skiing trade for over a decade. During this time, he has trained people from the UK and from different parts of Europe. But, now he wants to share what he has learnt with Nepalis as he aims to inspire a new generation of adventure lovers to carry on his legacy in the mountains.
Krishna Thapa says Nepal has so much potential, but the country has not been able to utilise it. “I was fortunate enough to learn from the best and now I want to share what I know with a younger generation of adventure lovers in the country so that Nepal can realise its potential and become a key destination when it comes to skiing in Asia,” says Thapa.
Thapa got into adventure sports when he was part of the British Gurkha. Realising his interest was in adventure sports, the Gurkhas sent him to train. In a few years, he learnt from the best in the trade and came back as a civilian to teach army professionals.
In 2009, he came to Nepal with skis. He knew the potential Nepal had, but during the time, people were not interested.
“I wanted to change people’s mindset and create an environment for skiing. Why? Because I’ve seen in Europe how it helps develop communities.”
Since 2009, whenever Krishna Thapa went trekking in the mountainous regions, he always took his skis with him. People were sceptical and told him it was ambitious of him, but he did not listen to them as he did what he wanted.
“Nepal is the home of eight-thousanders, but rarely do we see Nepalis skiing in the mountains,” he says. “But they carry skis for the foreigners. I want to change this.”
Since Krishna Acharya started, a lot of Nepali climbers have taken up skiing. Vinayak Jaya Malla and Tenji Sherpa were seen skiing around the slopes of Manaslu in January 2021.
“They are my students. It’s good that these young boys are trying to start this. A whole group of mountain guides affiliated with the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association also went to Europe to get training in skiing.”
Nepal’s mountains have long been a destination for adventure lovers. Mountains like Everest, Lhotse, Annapurna, Manaslu and Dhaulagiri have been skied by foreigners since the 1980s. Krishna Thapa says he himself has skied of Dhaulagiri, Manaslu and Makalu and says if promoted well, Nepal could do wonders.
“But, the government isn’t interested. I go to them with proposals, but some officials ask for bribes. Just because I don’t live here, they think they can bully me into paying them for something that will help the country.”
Instead, Krishna Thapa has been doing things on his own, through various grants he receives. Since he started the ski festival, he has trained over 1,000 people and he hopes he can continue to do so.
“I want to leave behind a legacy.”
But, he will need help. Skiing in Asia is in its infant stage. China and Mongolia are spending billions to set up, but in Nepal, no effort has been made.
Krishna Thapa says all that the government needs to do is set up favourable policies and help build infrastructure in areas like Langtang, Manang, and Khumbu.
“All we need are lodges and health posts. These are basic infrastructures that will pull more adventure lovers to Nepal. We should aim to attract the best of the best skiers and snowboarders out there, but they’ll only come if there are infrastructures in place.”
He says one destination ideal for skiing and snowboarding is Mera Peak. The 6,400-metre tall peak has the perfect slopes for training and hosting international level events.
Krishna Thapa says if marketed well, people will come to Nepal only to train for events being held in Europe. Since training at high altitudes is good for the body, this is another thing that the government should be looking at.
“We have so many places that have snow throughout the year. Yes, getting there is not easy, but if we tap into the right market, we have a chance to gain a lot.”
He is certain that Nepal can be a premium adventure destination for people and if people from the west know about it, it will be full of people.
“Kalinchok, Manang and Langtang need development first. But, we can explore many other places.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/krishna-thapa-skiing-nepal.html,travel
10 Nepali handicrafts you should take back as souvenirs from your Nepal visit,"Sunday, April 3, 2022","Nepali handicrafts have long been a part of the country’s cultural legacy, reflecting rich traditions and culture. Their history may be traced back to the stone era when humans lacked any form of instrument. Nepali handicrafts are most recognised for their beautiful art, crafts, and oriental architecture around the world.
The skills and techniques for manufacturing Nepali handicrafts that have been passed down from generation to generation reflect not only the ability and skill of crafters, but also the social, religious, and cultural values that exist in various sections of the country. There are several Nepali handicraft items that are loved by foreigners as souvenirs or are exported in large quantities for trade and business.
Here are the 10 best Nepali handicraft items that you should consider bringing back with you as souvenirs from your Nepal visit.
Thangka painting is a Buddhist painting made of cotton and silk. When these handicraft items are not used for display, they are rolled and kept on a textile backing which looks like Chinese scroll paintings, with a silk cover. They can last for a long time. But, they are delicate, that is why they are kept in dry places so that they do not get affected by moisture. Each of these paintings depicts a Buddhist deity or a scene. They serve as important teaching tools.
Thangkas worth Rs 16.5 million were exported in the fiscal year 2019/20, according to statistics published by the Federation of Handicraft Association of Nepal (FHAN), which is 75 per cent less than in FY 2018/19. In the previous fiscal year, thangkas worth Rs 65.3 million were shipped in 2018/19.
Carving in stone and metals is one of the ancient art forms that has been passed down through the generations since the beginning of time. A Nepali handicraft statue can be made out of a variety of materials, including copper, bronze, and brass.
Carving is a well-known craft that uses a hammer and chisel to carve in the shapes. In Nepal, you may see a wide range of sculptures. Nepali handicrafts such as metal products are shipped to countries like the USA, China, Korea etc. Especially popular are small idols of gods and goddesses as well as decorative and household items.
In the international market, Nepali paper and paper products are well-known. The lokta or dayshing (Daphne cannabira) plants are used to make Nepali papers. Moth resistance is its distinguishing attribute. Nepal exports a variety of items created from Nepali paper, including postcards, writing pads and papers, woodblock prints, calendars, gift wraps, lampshades, and so on. The United States, Japan, Canada, and European countries have been the most important markets.
Nepal is fortunate to be located in the Himalayan foothills, surrounded by beautiful green forests and hardwood trees. Needless to say, these trees provide valuable timber, which the locals make significant use of. Wooden craftsmanship has always been a highlight of the Nepali handicraft industry as well as architecture.
Wooden décors, flutes, bracelets, wooden masks, decorative boxes, small wooden windows, and much more are among the goods available. These products are in high demand in nations like India, China, and the United States. There are several goods ranging in price range from USD 13 dollars to 700 dollars.
Over the years, handwoven carpets have been one of Nepal’s most important exports. Since commercial carpets began to be produced in Nepal, the product’s quality has garnered attention from all around the world. Nepali handicraft carpets, which are often composed of wool and silk, are known for their double-knotting method, high pile density, and environmentally friendly manufacturing process. Handwoven carpets are being sold to over 60 countries for roughly USD 70 million, making it one of Nepal’s greatest exports.
Nepali jewellery is yet another important export among Nepali handicrafts. Such jewellery is manufactured mostly by the hands of trained artisans, and it reflects the country’s traditional arts and culture. Gold and silver earrings, necklaces, bracelets, brooches, pendants, payels, kalli, phuli, and other popular pieces of Nepali handicraft items.
Elements like gold and silver are regarded as holy metals by the people of Nepal. Gold and silver jewellery with various precious and semi-precious stones are a popular export. Varieties of precious and semi-precious stones such as ruby, corundum, sapphire, tourmaline, aquamarine, topaz, garnet, crystal quartz, beryl, and others are also available in different parts of the country,
Jewellery is preferred by all ages. Nepali silver jewellery is exported to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, among others.
Singing bowls are Buddhist traditional goods that date back thousands of years. These bowls were created by ancient Nepali and Tibetan monks who were Gautama Buddha’s disciples. In monasteries, monks use singing bowls to transform negative energy into positive energy. It is also utilised for silent profound meditation.
This Nepali handicraft item is now well-known for its use in meditation, music, relaxation, and personal well-being. The tones of the singing bowl reach every part and cell of human bodies, transforming how we feel, move, and think. You may discover numerous sorts of these singing bowls in Nepal at varying rates, whether they are handcrafted or machine-made, engraved or plain, made of brass or some other metal.
Singing bowls worth around Rs 12 billion are shipped annually to major countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Korea, China, and India.
Felt is claimed to be one of the oldest Nepali handicraft items. It is used in a broad range of items, including the automobile sector, art and design equipment, and musical instruments. Of the popular felt items are handmade felt decorations, handmade felt balls, ornamental slippers, and felt mats.
According to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the nation exported felt items worth Rs 2.74 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year (mid-July 2021 to mid-March 2022), up 61.97 per cent from the previous fiscal year’s export bill of Rs 1.69 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the nation exported felt items valued at Rs 2.15 billion. According to felt dealers, the United States and European nations are the most important markets for Nepali felt, followed by Japan and Canada.
Shawls, handkerchiefs, ties, and even table mats are among the ‘Palpali Dhaka’ goods available in Nepal. Buffalo hides and goat skins are also available in Nepal and are primarily exported in the forms of wet blue, chrome tanned, chrome crust, and chrome complete finished.
Nepal has been making and exporting a wide range of leather items, both contemporary and traditional, for several decades. Leather items such as jackets, handbags, belts, purses, shoes, gloves, and wallets are made in Nepal and have a strong export market. Pakistan, the United States of America, and Japan are the biggest export markets for leather and leather goods from Nepal.
After readymade garments and hand-knotted woollen carpets, Nepali handicraft pashmina items have become Nepal’s third-largest international export commodity. The inner coat of a mountain goat’s hair is known as pashmina. It is created by blending the goat’s natural hair. Pashmina’s softness, lightness, fineness, warmth, and long-lasting characteristics, as well as workmanship, define its quality. Shawls, stoles, mufflers, scarves, blankets, and readymade clothing are the most popular pashmina exports.
These Nepali handicraft goods are available in any hue the customer desires, whether synthetic or natural dyes are used. The United States of America is the major importer of Nepali pashmina products outside of Nepal. Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Canada, and Switzerland are all key markets for pashmina products.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepali-handicrafts-for-souvenirs.html,travel
"Post-Covid Mustang sees a rise in the number of domestic, foreign tourists","Thursday, March 31, 2022","Galeshwar, March 31
The inflow of domestic and foreign tourists has shot up in the trans-Himalayan touristic district, Mustang, with the fear of coronavirus infection receding of late.
Tourism entrepreneurs are happy right at the moment when daily around 3,000 tourists are entering the department through land and air routes. Along with a rise in the influx, the landscape of the marvellous tourism hotspot has also changed.
Jomsom Airport sources say daily 15 flights are taking place now in Mustang – the centre of attraction for domestic and domestic tourists. Likewise, there seems a long queue of land transport vehicles on the Beni-Jomsom road leading to Muktinath and Lomanthang.
Lately, over 2,000 tourists are daily entering the district via land routes, according to police. Likewise, Jomsom Airport Chief Puskal Raj Sharma says over 250 tourists are arriving in the district via air daily.
Tourism entrepreneurs say the arrival of tourists via air and land routes has invariably upped in Mustang which saw almost zero mobility of tourists during a two-year hiatus of the Covid pandemic.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/post-covid-mustang-more-tourists.html,travel
"Nepal mountaineering season 2022: Everest’s getting quieter, but there’s something else to hope for","Monday, March 28, 2022","With spring already here, mountaineers from all over the world–including Russia–are starting to land in Nepal. But, unlike other years, these mountaineers are not here only for Everest this mountaineering season. Nepal’s other eight-thousanders have started to garner interest among climbers.
With China closing its mountains for tourists yet again, Nepal is the only country available for mountaineers in the Himalayan region, but the Department of Tourism believes the number will be significantly low this year.
“We’ve only handed out 10 permits so far. We expect there won’t be as many crowds this mountaineering season, but it’s still early days. People are gradually arriving, so let’s see how it goes,” says Surya Prasad Upadhyay, a director at the department.
So what can you expect? Here’s a small rundown.
The war in Europe has had an effect on bookings for Everest. By this time in other mountaineering seasons, almost all teams would be fully booked, but some expedition agencies are still advertising for the Everest Lhotse climb. This means the number of climbers on Everest is likely to be less than the 400 odd who took permits last year. Apart from the war in Europe, China making it hard for its citizens to return is also creating issues in the climbing sector, say expedition outfits.
As usual, Seven Summit Treks will have the most number of people on Everest this mountaineering season. Its team of superstar climbers including record-holder Kami Rita Sherpa and K2 summiteer Sona Sherpa have left for base camp as they have been assigned to fix ropes to the summit of the highest peak on earth. The icefall doctors, deployed by the SPCC, have already started fixing ropes up the infamous Khumbu Ice Fall.
The official data are yet to come on how many will climb Everest this year, but the numbers are likely to be around 250 to 300, say officials as almost all expedition outfits still have many climbers. This is great news for those wanting to have an intimate climbing experience. It is also great for those who want to climb Everest without the help of supplemental oxygen given the lack of crowd.
Doing the Everest-Lhotse doubleheader has become quite trendy in recent mountaineering seasons. Over the past few years, expedition companies in Nepal and abroad have given their clients a good deal to do both. But, with not many being able to do the doubleheader, it will be interesting to see how many actually get the permits. Usually, it is less than 100, but this year, looking at the situation, it will be less than 50. There are reports that South Korean climber and polar explorer Hong Sun-Taek will attempt the impressive South Face of Lhotse for the seventh time.
After leading a huge team last year with Pioneer Adventure, Mingma G Sherpa is back on Dhaulagiri this mountaineering season and his team has already set up camp 1. It is not clear if any other team will be heading to Dhaulagiri this year. Jill Wheatley, who was with Mingma G at Manaslu during their historic climb to the mountain’s true summit is with him again as she wants to tick another mountain as she aims to climb all 14 eight-thousanders. Carlos Soria, the veteran Spanish climber, is also heading towards Dhaulagiri for his 13th attempt to climb the mountain.
Seven Summit Trek also has a small team on Dhaulagiri that will reach the base camp in a few weeks as does Pioneer Adventure.
If rumours are true, there are going to be a lot of people on Kanchenjunga this mountaineering season. Seven Summit Treks has a group that will be led by Sanu Sherpa who wants to create history by climbing all 14 eight-thousanders twice. Pioneer Adventures and a few other companies also have teams on Kanchenjunga that is gaining popularity amongst climbers every year. Journalist-turned-mountaineer Purnima Shrestha is also heading towards the mountain where she will attempt to climb her fifth eight-thousander.
Makalu is one of the most underrated mountains in Nepal. Its pyramid-like structure woos a lot of mountaineers who see it from Everest, but not many people attempt to climb it. This mountaineering season though, there seems to be significant interest from both Nepali and foreign companies. Alpenglow Expeditions will have a team on the mountain as its lead guide Adrian Ballinger has shown interest in skiing off the mountain. The company’s rapid ascent team will arrive in Nepal soon. Seven Summit Treks also has a team on the mountain as does Pioneer Adventure.
Last spring, Annapurna saw a lot of people. But, this year, there has not been much interest. Until now, only Seven Summit Treks has a small group heading up the mountain. Its team included Arjun Vajpai, the youngest to ever climb Mount Everest. Pioneer Adventure had a few Ukrainian climbers interested, but due to the war raging there, they cancelled. Other outfits are not sure if they will have an expedition on Annapurna this mountaineering season.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-mountaineering-season-everest.html,travel
7 things a tourist should do in Nepal during spring,"Friday, March 25, 2022","Nepal during spring is different. The air is fresh, the trees are blossoming with flowers and the weather is just perfect. Add some special festivals and you have the best season to visit Nepal. A lot of people travel to Nepal during spring for trekking, some visit Nepal for mountaineering, but the country offers tourists a lot more than just trekking and mountaineering during spring.
Today, we bring a list of activities that you can indulge yourself in Nepal during spring. It is very handy if you are planning to visit Nepal during the season.
For people who do not want to spend days trekking in Nepal during spring, short hikes around major cities like Kathmandu or Pokhara are perfect during spring. Head to these hills in the morning and you get to see blooming rhododendrons, different birds and fresh weather. If the city’s air is not polluted, you might also get a glimpse of the mountain but that is secondary because the breeze and the sound of the woods during the spring season will make you want to hike every week.
Where: Lakuri Bhanjyang, Nagarkot, Shivapuri, Sarangkot, Dhampus, Ghandruk, Ghorepani
Many argue that autumn is the best time for mountain flights, but to many, it is in Nepal during spring. The mountains are full of snow and the weather just seems fresh. A mountain flight to go see Everest is recommended; but; if you want a more closeup experience, you can get on a helicopter and go wherever you want to. Thanks to clear weather during spring and low winds, you can go anywhere you want.
Where: Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Base Camp, Kori Danda, Gosainkunda, Panch Pokhari
If you have not done rafting, you ought to try it at least once. Why rafting in Nepal during spring? Well, the flow is not as powerful as it would during the summer or autumn, which makes it a lot safer. The warm weather is also ideal for rafting in spring.
Where: Trishuli, Seti, Bhotekoshi, Marsyangdi, Kaligandaki, Sunkoshi
Spring is the season when everything starts afresh. And, if you like greenery, parks are the place where you should be in Nepal during spring. You must have seen the jacaranda trees painting the streets of Kathmandu pink during spring, but the parks are even prettier. So if you are someone who loves plants and flowers, visit some of the parts of the city you are in; you will not be disappointed.
The Terai, the southern plains of Nepal, has its own charm. The landscape and people make it unique from other parts of Nepal. If you have not been, you should consider getting there during spring because the temperatures are ideal. Yes, it is still hot, but the mornings and evenings are very pleasant. Since it is hot during the day, you might be lucky enough to get a glimpse of the elusive Bengal tiger if you around the national parks. If you are not, you will still get to witness a gem of a sunset. Make sure to try the different food items from different regions.
Spiritual tourism in Nepal is much underrated. There are so many good yoga schools you can enrol in. Would it not be cool to roll down your mat, strike your asanas, and meditate against the world’s highest mountain peaks or lush green woods? If this seems enticing, come to Nepal during spring and indulge yourself in various yoga activities. If you want it more spiritual, you can live in a monastery and get an experience like no other.
Springtime is all about welcoming the new year and Nepalis do that by celebrating various festivals. They welcome spring by celebrating festivals like Shivaratri, Holi, the Nepali new year and various other indigenous festivals that take place around the country. It is a great way to learn about the country that is more than the mountains and immerse yourself in Nepali culture and tradition.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visit-nepal-during-spring.html,travel
Flights at Kathmandu airport affected throughout the day as communication equipment goes kaput,"Thursday, March 24, 2022","Kathmandu, March 24

Several flights have been cancelled whereas others have been delayed. The Tribhuvan International Airport authority says flights on both domestic and international sides have been affected.
As per provisional arrangements, only one flight can land or take off at the Kathmandu airport every 15 minutes now. In normal times, the airport provides landing/taking off opportunities to an aircraft once every two or three minutes.
The airport administration says the problem was caused by water leakage inside the building that houses the communication equipment.

Fraud? Kathmandu airport forces visitors to pay Rs 100 for using the waiting lounge,"Tuesday, March 22, 2022","Kathmandu, March 22
In an apparent act of fraud, the Kathmandu airport has been forcing visitors who go there to receive their families or guests to pay up to Rs 100 just for using the waiting lounge, which should have been allowed free of cost.
For the past three months, the airport has been charging visitors to use the waiting lounge. There are two options available: Rs 50 and Rs 100 for deluxe and superior rooms. Those who cannot pay or deny this are forced to stand up outside.
The Tribhuvan International Airport administration does not directly collect the money but defends the apparent illegal act.
The Kathmandu airport chief Prem Nath Thakur says collecting fees is not unusual as it is a matter of choice.
The airport has contracted a private company named IMS Airport Service to manage some of its sections and the company collects the charge.
“We also get some amount into royalty from the company’s income. If someone wants to sit in an air-conditioned clean room, they should pay the minimum charge,” Thakur says, “There are complaints, but this should not be considered unnatural.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fraud-kathmandu-airport-waitin-lounge.html,travel
Everest climbing 2022: Icefall doctors reach base camp to fix ropes,"Monday, March 21, 2022","Kathmandu, March 21
A team of eight icefall doctors has reached the Everest base camp to prepare the route for mountaineers to the summit of Sagarmatha (Everest) to facilitate the climbing this spring season.
A team led by Angsarki Sherpa, an icefall doctor who has been active in route construction for a long time, has reached the base camp. The team left Namche for the base camp on March 12 and will start the work after paying homage at the Pangboche monastery and determining the auspicious hour with the guidance of a Lama, says the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC) vice-chairman Lama Kaji Sherpa.
Icefall doctors prepare the route from the base camp to camp II of Mount Everest using stairs and ropes. From the base camp, the world’s highest Mount Everest as well as Lhotse and Nuptse are climbed.
With the onset of the tourist season, foreign tourists have started coming to Khumbu in the Everest region. The number of foreign tourists entering the Khumbu region has been increasing following the onset of spring.
According to the Khumbu Pasanglamu rural municipality, more than 100 domestic and foreign tourists visit the Khumbu area daily.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-climbing-2022-icefall-doctors.html,travel
"Pandemic chased Nepal’s experienced trekking guides away. With novices, the tourism industry is suffering","Friday, March 18, 2022","Jason Walker and his wife Jennifer came to Nepal in October 2021. Having heard a lot of the Shey Phoksundo, they wanted to experience the lake and Dolpa first hand. But, the couple found it very hard to find a trekking guide that would take them there. As the trails around the Dolpo circuit is not marked well, most guides are hesitant to do the route and the couple were left frustrated when they could not meet anyone.
“We went to Langtang instead. It wasn’t our preferred destination but it sucked not being able to go to Dolpo,” says Walker.
The Covid pandemic has broken Nepal’s tourism industry. The most affected by it are trekking guides whose only sources of income are guiding foreigners around Nepal. Due to a loss of income for several months, a lot of Nepal’s experienced trekking guides are quitting the profession and are doing something else.
This has left a gap in the industry as many guides do not want to go to remote places in the country. This in the long run will cause a lot of problems when the country starts to see a rise in the number of tourists, say stakeholders.
Three years ago, Sandesh Regmi, 33, from Dharka Phedi in Dhadhing was guiding a group of four Americans to the top of Throng La. As a trekking guide, his life was going well. He would guide 10 groups a year and be making enough money to survive in Kathmandu.
But, in March 2020, everything changed for him. The Covid pandemic and the lockdown meant he had no work. He had hoped things would get better in 2021, but they did not. After a lot of contemplating, Regmi, who had been in the field for over a decade, decided to leave Nepal.
“Covid hit me hard,” says Regmi from his room in Dubai where he works at a packaging factory. “I had to give up a career that was close to my heart because I had loans to pay off. I don’t know for certain if I’ll get back to it when I come back, but I really miss it.”
“A lot of my friends have left too because there’s no money in it right now. We all have bills to pay and children to educate. I think many won’t return,” says Regmi.
According to the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN), there are over 15,000 trekking guides in the country. These guides are of different skill levels.
Those that are new to the industry have a basic guiding level and only try and do commercial routes like the Annapurna Base Camp or Everest Base Camp. TAAN officials say that they choose these routes because many have been there before as porters and find it convenient to do so. But, when it comes to areas like Dolpa or Kanchenjunga, people find it hard to find guides.
Shiva Bastakoti, a trekking guide based in Kathmandu, says the number of guides to go to these places are low because most tourists usually do not go to places like Dolpa or Kanchenjunga. He says that due to rising costs and the need to set up camps, most tourists also refrain to go these places.
“You need to take around six people to cater to the need of two tourists. When that happens, the cost will rise. Yes, there aren’t experienced trekking guides who go there, but with a lack of demand and high cost, even an experienced one will want to go guide along the comfortable commercial routes around,” says Bastakoti.
He says the around 20 per cent of trekking guides he knows have quit guiding and are doing other things. Some have started their own business, many have gone back into farming while a majority have left Nepal to work in the Gulf countries.
Chura Mani Aryal of Navigate Outdoors, a tour operator based in Kathmandu, says the equation has turned dysfunctional due to the government not paying much attention to the sector that is a major contributor to the country’s GDP.
“These trekking guides that have left due to frustration. They spend years training and honing their skill and when a crisis like the pandemic hits them, the government offers no help. It’s a sad reality,” says Aryal.
He says while the government is helping big trekking agencies, smaller companies are not being looked at, which will cause issues in the long run.
“It’s guides and the tea houses that should be helped, not major corporations. The government policies are ridiculously bad,” he adds.
Even TAAN’s president Khum Bahadur Subedi agrees that more needs to be done to retain trekking guides. He says the government needs to invest in the people who are currently in the industry and make sure they have the skills to read maps, the ability to conduct a rescue and detailed knowledge about first aid.
“We have to produce skilled guides because you never know what goes on in the mountains and we have been doing these training regularly in coordination with other agencies. But, now an effort needs to be put by the government too,” says Subedi.
Meanwhile, Sandesh Regmi feels his time is as a trekking guide is up. He feels that neither the company he worked for nor the government took care of him during bad times. He says that while he does miss going out, he will only be guiding the foreign friends he made during his career as a guide.
“Nepal doesn’t care about us and that is a fact. I will come back to Nepal after my contract here is over,r but when I do, I will not guide because I’ve realised that it is not a secure enough job,” says Regmi.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/trekking-guide-nepal-post-covid.html,travel

The national flag carrier Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has resumed flights to the airports in Chainpur of Bajhang, Sanphe of Achham and Dipayal of Doti.
Earlier Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Prem Bahadur Ale, had directed the NAC to include the above-mentioned destinations in its regular flight service.

Travelling and investing abroad: 4 easy ways for Nepali citizens,"Friday, March 11, 2022","Before you begin the adventure of travelling the world, you will have taken time preparing. A part of the preparations involves saving money. But, have you thought of how you will earn more money when you travel out of Nepal as Nepali citizens?
Finding a way to earn extra cash will ensure that you have fewer budget-related issues. This way, you can do everything you want to do and even extend your trip for longer than you originally planned.
Having money to spend while travelling for long periods may not be easy. But for some, this is a reality. They are able to do this even without a huge bank balance. From getting a location-independent job to picking up casual work, there are many options out there for Nepali citizens travelling abroad.
You just have to figure out what works for you while travelling.
Let’s find out how easy it is for Nepali citizens to travel and work abroad.
Investment in citizenship makes it easy for Nepali citizens to obtain a second citizenship certificate. Some people think that investing in dual citizenship is not a good idea because it will put a strain on their wealth. But, there are reasons as to why this is important for people travelling as Nepali citizens.
Making economic contributions to a foreign country such as the US and Saint Kitts and Nevis enable you to gain citizenship by investment. Acquiring Saint Kitts and Nevis citizenship by investment makes it easy for non-citizens such as Nepali citizens. Saint Kitts and Nevis is an attractive location where you would love to own a second home.
Apart from contributing to the development of your host nation, you would need to be an adult of 21 years. Nepali citizens are also required to invest capital that has been legally acquired if they are to invest in the US. Ensure that you have proof of the source of your funds.
Property investment is something to consider as Nepali citizens who love to travel. But, you need to have the means and inclination. Invest in a foreign property without the same tax penalties associated with investing in foreign stocks.
Based on what country you are living in, the returns can be profitable when you finally sell the property. Ensure you work with a reputable real estate agent and a lawyer to ensure your investment is safe.
If Nepali citizens plan to return to Nepal in a few years, they can purchase a Nepal-based property to rent out while abroad. Ensure you have a reliable property manager in Nepal to handle the rental while you are away. Real estate is a long-term investment that anyone who wants to invest abroad should think about.
Before investing in a property in the US, you need to understand the taxes and fees involved in the purchase. Know that some of the one-off costs involved with purchasing a property are taken care of by you, the buyer. The rest is the responsibility of the seller.
There are two reasons why gold comes to mind for travellers intending to invest overseas, and it includes Nepali citizens too. First, investors can trade it from anywhere. Second, gold is an asset that is trusted to gradually gain value with time. These are convincing reasons to make Nepali citizens want to invest overseas.
You might also want to invest in gold ETFs rather than pure gold. ETF trades a lot of different investments as a sort of package deal. ETF focuses on gold, but on different assets like gold futures and leveraged gold prices.
The best gold ETFs take some of the hassles out of gold trading. This causes investors to land a greater return over time. The following are the requirements for Nepali travellers intending to invest in gold funds:
Freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr make it easy to get jobs. You only need demonstrable skills in a sought-after area. The only limitation for beginners is that winning projects is not easy. That is because you need a proven track record of what you say you can do.
Once you have positive feedback on your profile, you can be guaranteed work. Web design and content writing are examples of lucrative fields in freelancing.
If you consider travelling full-time, how about work exchange, also known as work travel? This is where you get to exchange your time and abilities for accommodation. You can also find a host looking for some help in hostels, restaurants, or small businesses. You can lend them a hand for some time and get accommodation or other benefits in exchange.
Several countries have been making it easy for investors to get dual citizenship. It is important, however, to note that different countries have different requirements.
They also have different laws when it comes to opportunities for travellers to work and invest. A Nepali would have to do the research and find out what is expected of them in their new country.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/investing-abroad-nepali-citizens.html,travel
Flying to Nepal doesn’t need a Covid PCR report if you have a vaccination certificate,"Thursday, March 10, 2022","Kathmandu, March 10
Nepalis and foreigners flying to Nepal do not need a PCR report certifying they do not have Covid from now onwards–provided they have a vaccination certificate that shows they are fully vaccinated against the infection.
The same rule applies to the people coming to Nepal via land entry points.
The cabinet meeting held last week made the decision, and the decision has been circulated to all concerned ministries and other stakeholders.
The decision means you need the PCR test report for flying to Nepal only if you are not vaccinated or cannot show the vaccination card. In such a case, the test should have been conducted within the last 72 hours before the flight.
Besides this, there is no other Covid-related restriction regarding travel in effect as of now, according to the officials.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/flying-to-nepal-no-per-report.html,travel

Nepal opening 27 new five-star hotels as investors pour money despite Covid,"Thursday, March 10, 2022","Kathmandu, March 10
Wait for the next few months to years, and Nepal will have 27 new five-star hotels in operation.
The data at the Department of Tourism reveal as investors in Nepal’s hospitality industry did not let the Covid pandemic shatter their aspirations as they continued to pour money into new hotels.
Most of these five-star hotels will be based in Kathmandu followed by Rupandehi and Banke. The newly constructed Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa has attracted investors to Rupandehi whereas Indian investors have been attracted to open new businesses in Banke as it is a gateway to Manasarovar.
Hotel Association of Nepal member Youb Raj Shrestha says Kathmandu still retains the investors’ attraction as it already has established tourism products to sell.

How three sisters changed the face of the ‘sexist’ trekking industry in Nepal’s tourism capital,"Wednesday, March 9, 2022","When three sisters–Lucky, Dicky and Nicky Chhetri– ran a lodge in Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, in the early 90s, they started to get similar complaints from female trekkers visiting the Annapurna Base Camp or the Annapurna Circuit. These complaints would mostly be about how male guides misbehaved with them during the trek. It was something female tourists faced in most parts of South Asia and that gave the three sisters an idea.
“We felt that we could do something about it and with it create change which could benefit Nepal’s society and the tourism sector,” says Lucky.
That is when they started 3 Sisters Adventure Trekking, an all-woman trekking company that would cater to the needs of female trekkers. Through the company, the three sisters have been able to create a sustainable business along with helping women, mostly from rural Nepal, make a living by smashing stereotypes and doing something that was done predominantly by men.
“There were a lot of sceptics when we started and I think we’ve proved everyone wrong,” she says.
The company began in 1994 when the three sisters themselves embarked on a trekking trip to Annapurna Base Camp. Having seen the demand, they wanted to see if women could guide in the mountains; after coming back from the ABC, they realised this could be done. The three sisters, for a few years, conducted these trips themselves, but soon, they knew they needed people.
By the late 90s, the three sisters were famous among foreigners who wanted their service. Seeing the demand, they started recruiting and training women. Wanting to create a positive change, and having seen how people from rural Nepal were treated, Lucky felt hiring them would be the best way to move forward.
“These women needed empowering and that is what we were able to do. It was hard during the start as we needed to teach and train them, but as years went by, things started to go smooth.”
These women were mostly from so-called lower castes in Nepal. She says there were also women who were banished from their homes after divorce.
“It feels good to have helped these people.”
But, the three sisters did face their fair share of criticism from people who questioned why women were being hired to do a man’s job and going around Nepal with complete strangers. That, for them, was a major challenge when they started off. But, gradually as years passed, things started to get better.
“We created a revolution of a sort and many felt that we would and could not continue this.”
The doubters were proved wrong. It took time to build trust among everyone, but with time, they were able to do so and started to get appreciated even by men. This was possible only through hard work and the love from their clients who loved how the way women were being empowered by the three sisters.
But, convincing the community that women could do this was a tough task in the beginning.
“Even women were against this and didn’t believe that we were Nepali guides. That is when our clients stepped in, started to help us by bringing us women who were interested to do this.”
But, they needed to train them. For that, they were lucky as the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) was conducting a course in Pokhara. They say that the training was great for the educated people. But, the women they had in contact had dropped out of school or never gone to school. The training was hard for them. So, using what the three sisters learned, they redesigned the training to help these women become better at guiding.
“It took us two years to develop a curriculum that would be favourable for women from rural Nepal. It was fun and full of learning and everyone enjoyed it and we still continue this training.”
With the success of the training, even women from urban areas started to get interested. And, that brought another challenge for the sisters. Compared to rural women, most urban women could not walk. On the other hand, the rural ones could not speak as much as their urban counterparts, so it was a constant challenge to balance things out between the two.
Overcoming this now, Lucky says that during a season, the three sisters employ nearly 200 women who travel all across Nepal. These women are provided with insurance and equipment if needed as well.
The challenging stereotype was hard but they overcame that, other challenges like diseases like Covid-19, SARS and the Maoist insurgency was also a major threat to their business.
“But, now we have a new challenge – global warming. We have trained people, but we’ve realised that unnatural things are happening in the mountains and that poses a big risk because you never know what to expect from the mountains.”
The three sisters are also involved in rescuing children working at tea houses. Working in tandem with the International Labour Organisation, Lucky and her sister say they rescued many girls who they keep at a safe house in Pokhara. They educate these girls and if interested offer jobs as well.
“That is the least we could do.”
Lucky feels that having been in the business for nearly three decades, they have been able to do a lot: from creating new employment opportunities for women to showing people what women are capable of if given a chance.
“We were able to do something unimaginable in Nepal. But, this hasn’t been done alone. We’ve had people supporting us through small donations and training grants and we want to thank everyone who joined us in our journey.”
“It is because of everyone that we were able to economically empower women and create a career in a profession dominated by men.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/three-sisters-adventure-trekking.html,travel
"Nepal expects more Asians, fewer Europeans this climbing season","Monday, March 7, 2022","Kathmandu, March 7
Nepal’s tourism and mountaineering officials are preparing for the new climbing season this spring. As there are some domestic challenges in making the season a success financially, the officials fear the ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions might have an impact.
Consequently, it is highly likely that the number of European mountaineers and other visitors will see a significant drop whereas the number of Asians might go up.
“Tourists scheduled to visit from Russia and Ukraine have already cancelled their bookings. Hence, we fear it will have an impact on other parts of Europe also,” the Nepal Mountaineering Association‘s general-secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung says.
Because of the crisis in Europe, Asians planning for Europe trips might divert their way towards Nepal, hence the number of Asians might go up, according to him.
Nepal had issued 659 climbing permits in the spring climbing season last year, which was the record high in Nepal’s mountaineering history.

"As Nepal heads for a busy climbing season, mountain guides wage another unhealthy battle","Monday, March 7, 2022","The Nepal Mountaineering Association and the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association have not seen eye to eye over the past year. There is some real toxicity going on between the two associations of mountain guides.
As the country is heading for a busy climbing season, key professionals in the community are for another round of the rather unhealthy battle, further extending a year-old issue. It is highly likely that the battle will have an impact on the mountaineering business in the season.
In March 2021, the Department of Tourism under the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, had released a statement about the passing of a new law that will recognise red book holders of the Nepal Mountaineering Association as mountain guides. This did not go down well with the NNMGA, and its representatives then filed a writ petition asking the Supreme Court to stop the NMA from handing out mountain guide certification to people.
Their main argument was people who climb could not be called mountain guides as the red book could be obtained by anyone who climbed Everest once. The NNMGA said it wanted to fight for their rights to be called mountain guides because it felt there was a big difference between support climbers and mountain guides.
“Just because you are a strong climber doesn’t mean you can be called a guide. And, the government wanted to recognise them as mountain guides before they recognised us,” said a member of NNMGA last year.
And, this did not go down well with the NMA. NMA’s chief Santa Bir Lama in an interview says that it was wrong for the NNMGA to file a case that could be solved through talking. He says as the NMA supports this training, these people should be indebted to the NMA and people like Kami Rita Sherpa who trains these people.
“This should have been settled on the table instead they went to the court.”
But, the NNGMA says that it tried to hold discussions with the NMA, but after nothing came out of it, it had no choice but to go to the court to fight for the rights.
Meanwhile, on February 22, 2022, the NMA sent a letter to 43 IFMGA Nepali mountain guides saying their NMA membership would be cancelled unless they sent in a written clarification on why it shouldn’t be. Cancellation of their NMA membership would mean that the IFMGA guides would not be given permits to climb during the climbing season.
This shows how the incident has escalated as a few members of the organisations have been going at it on social media criticising each other. While one side feels that the NMA is bullying the international mountain guides in Nepal, the latter feels that the NNGMA is trying to take away jobs from the people who depend a lot on the mountains.
“All we wanted was recognition from the government. Maybe that was too much to ask for,” says an NNMGA member.
The NNMGA is an association that is a member of the International Federation of Mountain Guide Association (UIAGM/IFMGA) that aims to create quality mountain guides in the country through regular and rigorous training.
Working in tandem with the NMA, the NNMGA has been conducting various courses in the mountains like rock climbing, ice climbing and basic rescue courses with the goal of training more people who can work safely in the mountains. The NNMGA has also been sending its members to conduct the NMA’s basic and advanced mountaineering courses.
“The NMA is the country’s alpine club. We have a lot of respect for them, but what they are doing right now is wrong,” says an NNMGA member.
On the eve of the mountaineering season, the NMA threatening the NNMGA mountain guides feels a cheap shot. But, the NMA members say they had to do this as it was affecting the livelihood of 3,000 people.
“The mountain community is not run by them [the internationally recognised mountain guides]. It’s run by the blood and sweat of people like us. Why is it so hard for them to admit that we will be recognised as mountain guides? What right do they have to go against the integrity of the organisation,” says an NMA member.
There is partial truth to this. But, the NMA and the Department of Tourism (Mountaineering) under the government plan to hand out a mountain guide license to anyone who has a red book is dangerous, according to the NNMGA. If they were doing so based on experience, it would be fair. But, based on a red book that can be obtained without even climbing a mountain or after climbing Everest just does not make sense.
“But, we will not be giving it to inexperienced climbers. There is a recommendation process, through which we will identify skilled people and give them the license,” says NMA.
Yet, the NNMGA is not too sure about this. It argues climbing than climbing Everest or other commercial expeditions. This is why it is calling Nepal to produce better mountain guides as it wants the country to bring in better-spending clients. And, if a guide is not experienced enough, these people will not come.
Stakeholders say there is a vast difference between an IFMGA guide and an NMA mountain guide. While some NMA guides claim that their counterparts cannot work on a mountain like Everest without them, they are trained to work in these mountains by instructors who mostly are from the NNMGA.
It takes fives years of regular training to become an internationally certified mountain guide. What a lot of mountaineers have failed to understand in Nepal is that there is a difference between climbing and guiding.
“I’m sure that a lot of Nepal’s mountaineers who have climbed Everest over 10 times can’t guide properly,” says an NNMGA guide.
But, the NMA people think that this is a flawed argument. They say that experience matters as much as training and some of them have that in abundance. A few even argue that not everyone can be an IFMGA guide because it costs a fortune to become one.
“No one wants to spend USD 10,000 and above to become a mountain guide. We have families to feed,” says an NMA member.
The NNMGA folks also do not want that either as they understand this is not everyone’s cup of tea. What they want is the government to recognise them the same way the international climbing club has.
They want the (NMA) red book holders to be known as expedition guides as well as it would sound better internationally and give experienced mountaineers the respect they deserve. But, they are adamant that calling people with experience mountain guides would be wrong.
“We don’t have anything against anyone. We are all brothers and want the best for everyone, but giving the title of mountain guides to everyone will not make our community better. Only training will,” says an NNMGA member.
An NNMGA source says it wants to create more people who will help make the mountain community better. There have been talks among various international expedition companies that Nepal is not safe for climbing Everest as the mountain as there are a lot of local guides without the experience to guide the different types of clients.
Take the 2019 traffic jam on the south summit. Some international expedition companies have argued if there were trained mountain guides, things like that would not happen. A well-trained guide would let a faster climber go but when people are not taught this, they will do what they are told.
Having more IFMGA guides is beneficial for the mountain community and the country as well. An IFMGA guide earns a lot more money than an average mountain guide. This means the climbers make money as does the country through their taxes.
A foreigner who comes into Nepal mostly looks for an IFMGA guide because of the reputation of these mountain guides. Sure, Nepal has its share of climbers who are more than great like Karmi Rita Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa and even Nirmal Purja. But, even these people hire IFMGA guides on their team because these guides through their hard work and training have earned the respect of the mountain fraternity internationally.
But things are still tense between them and many IFMGA guides are nervous heading into the season. One even says he was sceptical to go as the ego can cause bad things to happen on these mountains.
“To fulfil the dream of some people, the entire mountain community in Nepal that has worked together is being put out to dry. I hope there is no incident on the mountains,” says an NNGMA member.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mountain-guides-conflict-nepal.html,travel
From Kathmandu to Kanyakumari: Two Nepali bikers’ journey,"Monday, March 7, 2022","It was 3 pm on February 11. Though the sun was moving towards the west, soon to set, two Nepali bikers were preparing to set off on their journey, towards their dream city, filled with new hopes.
Aawashish Prasad Ojha and Bijay Raj Kasaju packed their luggage on their motorbikes and starting from Kathmandu, they embarked on a 15-day journey to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, South India. It was the K2K trip as they named it.
It was their first time riding their bikes for so long. They were also the first Nepali bikers to go from Kathmandu to Kanyakumari on bikes. They decided to reach Kanyakumari via Bhairahawa and then Uttar Pradesh.
It was certainly not an easy journey. But as per the popular saying in India, dar ke aage jeet hai’ (there is victory ahead of fear), they set out on a long journey with a little bit of excitement, a little fear and a lot of curiosity.
They wanted to make memories that would last a lifetime. Rider Ojha says, “We enjoyed the journey, not the destination.”
“Some people questioned us why we, as Nepali bikers, did not travel inside Nepal first, but we had to do something different, nobody had done before,” says Ojha.
After he convinced his family, Kasaju joined Ojha’s extravagant plan. But, even though they had a plan, they did not have bikes. So, they bought the bikes and started practising riding from Kathmandu to Bardibas via Sindhuli. Although Ojha bought a KTM, Kasaju bought an MT bike. But, riding for long caused Ojha to have a sore throat. Still, they did not have a camera and that’s when Ojha’s brother provided them with a camera.
“Kathmandu to Kanyakumari has become a super journey. It would be very tiring to ride the bike all day. But, for the sake of our dreams, we did not let the fatigue win.”
At times, the Nepali bikers were riding their bikes even without good food and proper sleep. Ojha says he had health problems when he had to ride a bike for a long time.
“To ride a bike over a long distance requires physical as well as mental fitness. The challenges are different when it comes to travel,” he says.
“We heard that the police administration would investigate, strictly, so we carried all the necessary documents,” he adds. Police elsewhere did not pay much attention, but the security personnel in Goa and Indore stopped them seeing the red number plates.
Upon seeing bikes with red number plates, Ojha shares, they would ask the Nepali bikers: Where did you come from? We have heard of Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh, where is Bagmati Pradesh?
Many also reacted in amusement when they found out about the Nepali bikers’ journey. Others, who could not reach there by themselves said they were very brave to travel all the way from Nepal on bikes.
They travelled 720 km in one day.  They were fascinated by the wide roads of India. “We were thrilled to be able to ride a bike on the roads of South India,” Kasaju says.
Many on the way also would inquire about the price of KTM bikes in Nepal. “They would be surprised that the bike costs Rs 750,000 and a helmet costs Rs 22,000. In India, one could purchase a good car for the same price.”
Upon reaching Indore, Ojha’s bike had some problems. But, the day the Nepali bikers reached Indore, it was a holiday so they had to wait until 10 am the next day to have their bikes repaired. They had collaborated with KTM Nepal, and it then collaborated further with KTM India, to service their bikes if and when they break down on the way. Meanwhile, they went around Indore, Kerala and Goa.
In Hyderabad, they had a hard time finding their way. But, even when they asked people the way, some told them to go one way while others told them the opposite. Yet the Nepali bikers reached dead ends or kept roaming the city endlessly. Finally, a driver helped them and they continued their journey.
“Outside Hyderabad, we reached a scary, deserted forest with no settlement areas. It was pretty scary,” says Kasaju.
One day, it was already 10:30 pm but they did not have accommodation. Without any hotel, they made up their minds to ride their bikes even during the night and navigated with the help of Google Maps. Only past midnight, they found the hotel and slept there.
The Nepali bikers covered a distance of about 6,800 km from Kathmandu to Kanyakumari. But, when they were leaving, the family told them to go on a flight if they really wanted to. “No one believed that we would reach Kanyakumari on bikes. But we had to do it, to do something different from others.”
In their journey, they found that people in South India were more educated, civilised and humble than in North India. The environment and society were very good.
As Ojha studied in South India from class seven, he knew Tamil and Malayalam. So they did not have any communication problems in South India.
In the movies, Kasaju had seen people eating various dishes on banana leaves, and he also ate food on banana leaves himself. But being a tourist, the Nepali bikers had to pay a higher price for food in some parts of India.
“Reaching Kanyakumari is a great achievement and a memory for me.”
Meanwhile, both Ojha and Kasaju plan to ride their bikes even within Nepal. And, they have plans to go to Rara via Manang and Mustang after some time.
Ojha is now again wishing to go to Kolkata from Kathmandu and is even convincing his family for this.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepali-bikers-kathmandu-kanyakumari.html,travel

Why does Kathmandu charge foreigners hefty fees to enter heritage sites?,"Thursday, March 3, 2022","Laura came to Nepal for the mountains but instantly fell in love with Kathmandu. Even amidst the chaos that Kathmandu is in every day, Laura found her little haven in the city – the Basantapur Durbar Square, one of the key heritage sites in Nepal’s capital.
At first, she felt that she needed to pay just once to enter the UNESCO World Heritage site, but when she went to the gate with her ticket the next day, she was asked to buy the other one. “I paid USD 10 just the other day and they asked me to pay again. I know we’re tourists, but you can’t be charging us to enter the main part of the city every day,” says Laura.
For Alice, who came to Nepal from France, things were even more expensive. Alice went to Bhaktapur as she had heard a lot about the city. When she approached the gates of the durbar square, she was asked to pay USD 15 to get in. Her Chinese friend only had to pay Rs 500.
“It makes no sense to do that, either charge everyone the same or don’t charge money at all,” she says.
That is the complaint of almost every tourist that visits many heritage sites in the Kathmandu valley. While fees for areas like Swyambhunath, Bouddhanath, Lumbini and the Changunarayan temple are not much, the cost to enter the durbar squares where the kings once lived has irked a lot of tourists over the course of the past decade. The discontent voices of tourists say that a change is needed. But authorities believe that as these heritage sites offer people a peek at the country’s intangible heritage, the fees are justified.
Most of the foreign tourists that come to Nepal visit the three squares in the Kathmandu valley. They go there for the classic monuments that are as old as the 16th century and to witness the lifestyle of the people. Almost all of the tourists find charm in these heritage sites that are unlike anywhere in the world.
But post-earthquake, things have changed. Between 2015 and 2021, all of these sites were under construction as most of these temples were either covered in scaffoldings or a steel gate. And, going into these places by paying USD10 and USD15 was not worth it to many.
In the past, the prices were not as high as it is right now. In 2007, a foreigner had to pay 200 rupees if they wanted to enter Kathmandu Durbar Square or even to cross it to go to the other side. Due to inflation, the Kathmandu metropolitan city increased the price to Rs 300 in 2009, Rs 400 in 2010 and by 2016, the cost to enter the premises was Rs 1,000.
The fee for SAARC residents is not that high though as they only pay Rs 150.
“That is something that we do to make things easy for everyone. Nepalis who go to heritage sites in India also pay less compared to a tourist,” he says.
A ticketing officer at the Basantpur Durbar Square says he is aware of the discontent shown by the tourists, but he can do nothing about it as it is set by the local government.
“We have had complaints because many feel that it is unfair to pay to get into something that is a part of the city, but they should remember that this is a world heritage site. Buildings here are over 200 years old, they need to realise that,” says the officer, adding it is mostly the backpackers who complain about the fees.
“They tell us they want to cross to the other side, but if they want to enter the site, they have to pay. If not, they can take the longer route,” says the officer.
Foreign tourists have other complaints too.
“I wouldn’t have minded if this money was being to construct this. But when I asked the people at Basantapur where the money was going, they didn’t answer,” says Laura.
But the local governments say the funds generated from the tourists visiting heritage sites mostly goes into conserving the tangible and intangible heritage. An official at the Kathmandu metropolitan city’s counter at Basantapur says while 30 per cent of the fee goes to Hanuman Dhoka Herchaha Adda, the remaining is used by the local government to conduct the different festivals in the city along with using it for restoration.
“Maybe these people don’t know, but we do use this to conduct festivals like Indra Jatra, the Ajima Jatra and various other festivals that are part of the city’s intangible heritage,” he says.
Rukesh Twanabasu, an officer at Bhaktapur Municipality Heritage Section, says the fee the city has set is the right one as tourists do not just get to see heritage sites but also be part of the intangible heritage in these areas.
“They get to see pottery, painting and everyday life here in Bhaktapur. I think people need to realise that before complaining. The same is the case in Patan or Basantapur; these people get to see something they can never see anywhere in the world and I think they need to be a bit considerate,” says Twanbasu.
He also adds that the reason they have a different fee for Indians and Chinese is the two are Nepal’s closest neighbours and adds they contribute more to the country’s tourism.
But, when you look at the number of tourists that come into the country and those that visit these areas, you can see where the problem lies about the fee issue. In 2019, Nepal recorded over 1 million arrivals, the most number of tourists it ever has,  but the number of people getting into heritage sites was quite low. In 2019, Patan Durbar Square saw around 160,000 tourists entering the palace premises while around 250,000 entered Bhaktapur.
While these numbers are quite good, the locals expect a lot more tourists to come. Prakash Prajapati who makes earthen pots in Bhaktapur Pottery Square says while the fee is good for the city, it would be good for business if they lowered the fee to get more tourists in.
“I think we need to talk about this because Covid-19 has broken our back and we need more and more tourists coming into the heritage sites so that they can enter shops like mine and buy things from here,” says Prajapati.
A street vendor at Basantpur Durbar Square is also on the same page. Bijaya Lama, who sells antiquities at the square, says that maybe it is about time the local governments experimented with lowering the fees of heritage site entrance to see if things would be better for all the shops and vendors around the place.
Laura also feels the same. She says that if the fees were below Rs 500, a lot of tourists would pick up more souvenirs. She says a lot of expatriates refrain from picking up anything from heritage sites there because they have to pay more for everything. From getting to these heritage zones to paying for cable car rides, they are charged more everywhere they go.
“Maybe it was time Nepal considered this because if you go abroad, things like these do not happen,” says Laura.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fees-kathmandu-heritage-sites.html,travel
"Nepal Army’s clean mountain campaign: Efforts to collect 35 tons of waste from Everest, 3 other peaks","Tuesday, March 1, 2022","A team of the Nepal Army will soon collect 35 tonnes of waste from four mountains of Nepal including the highest peak of the world, Mount Everest.
The army is launching the Sapha Himal Abhiyaan (the Clean Mountain Campaign) given the decreasing level of snow in the Himalayas and the increasing effects of climate change.
According to the Nepal Army spokesperson Narayan Silwal, the campaign will be conducted from April 5 till June 5 this year on Lhotse, Kanchenjunga, Manaslu and Everest.
“In the first phase, starting from November 6, 2021, to February 27, 2022, we were making preparations and coordinating the works,” he says, adding, “In the second phase, we will conduct acclimatisation training from February 28 to March 29. The cleanup will start in the third phase.”
A 29-member team including doctors from the Nepal Army will be deployed for garbage collection whereas 48 Sherpas will also join the team. The total number of cleanup crew will be 91 people including 14 in the coordination.
The programme this year is a continuation of the ongoing Sapha Himal Abhiyaan that was previously conducted in 2019 and 2021. “In the first year, 10 tonnes of garbage was collected from the Himalayan region whereas 27.6 tonnes of garbage was collected in 2021,” informs the Nepal Army spokesperson.
Kishor Adhikari, a Nepal Army official involved in the mission, says there are two types of waste on the mountains: decomposable and non-decomposable items dumped in those areas. “Empty oxygen cylinders, plastic bottles, cans, batteries, food items, torn tent remnants and other items are non-decomposable waste whereas the leftover foods and papers are decomposable waste.”
In Nepal, there are eight peaks above 8,000 metres and 1,310 peaks above 6,000 meters. The Nepal Army estimates that 50,000 climbers and about 80,000 supporters visit the peaks each year.
The army aims to collect 35 tonnes of waste including 14 tonnes from Everest alone, 10 from Kanchenjunga, six from Lhotse and five from Manaslu. Of them, 22 tonnes will be collected around the base camps whereas 13 tonnes will be collected from the areas above the base camps.
“Once the base camps are set up, we will fix ropes too. And with the help of the fixed ropes and the Sherpas, we will collect the rubbish as estimated from base camps and peaks above in joint efforts,” the official says.
The collected waste will be first transported to the base camps and it will be managed and verified in the presence of the concerned bodies. The decomposable waste will be stored and transported separately by local authorities and non-decomposable waste will be airlifted to Kathmandu and handed over to waste management companies.
According to Nepal Army officials, it is estimated that the campaign will cost Rs. 129.67 million.
“But, the government has allocated only Rs 83 million with discussions underway to further provide Rs 46.67 million.”
The remaining amount will be collected from other government offices of all three tiers, Nepal Mountaineering Association, Nepal Tourism Board, Himalayan Rescue Association, Trekking Agency Association and others, Adhikari adds.
He further informs that the amount allocated by the government this year is 17 per cent less than that of last year. “We will use monetary support from various government, non-government and private organisations/companies in a transparent and effective manner.”
According to Nepal Army’s estimation, around Rs 13 million will be spent on air travel, medical and communication services during the campaign. Further, Rs. 96.6 million will be spent on the purchase of personal clothing and accessories for the climbers.
It has also been estimated that Rs 108.62 million will be spent on the handling agencies. In addition, Rs 694.2 million is estimated to be spent on the allowance along with Rs. 445.7 million on miscellaneous expenses.
Silwal informs that the Nepal Army has already received permission to climb the peaks for the cleaning campaign. “We have completed the selection of the team leader and other climbers for the campaign.”
Currently, it is in process of calling for bids for the mountaineering materials and handling agency required for the campaign.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-army-clean-mountain-campaign.html,travel
9 best water tourism destinations in Nepal,"Monday, February 28, 2022","Nepal as a destination for water tourism is not promoted enough. Despite not having a sea, Nepal is home to some of the prettiest lakes in the world. These lakes are small in size compared to the ones in the US, but they do pack a punch.
Some of these lakes are as blue as the sky while some reflect the tone of the hills. Likewise, some are so remote that you need to walk days to get there. Some of these water tourism destinations might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but at the end of the day, getting to it will be absolutely worth it.
PS. If you do not want to walk, you can take a helicopter to these places too.
Many people think Pokhara is only home to Phewa and Begnas lakes. But, there are seven more lakes around the city. Rupa, Khaste, Dipang, Maidi, Gude, Niureni and Kamal lakes are all located in and around Pokhara. All of them are freshwater lakes and are included in the country’s Ramsar list. Getting to all of them in a day might not be possible, but you plan on staying in Pokhara for a few days and want to explore. Then, you will know going to these water tourism destinations will be worth it.
Gosainkunda is one of the holiest lakes in the country. Located at an altitude of 4,300 m in Langtang National Park, the place is a three-day trek from Kathmandu. This is believed to have been created by Lord Shiva to quench his thirst after swallowing poison. There are other lakes around this lake too to quench your water tourism thirst such as Bhairavkunda and Suryakunda which you can also observe and enjoy.
Rara is arguably the prettiest water tourism destination on this list. Located in Rara National Park, it is also the biggest freshwater lake in the country. The water is so pristine, on a clear day, that you are able to see the reflection of the sky turning it blue in colour. Over the last few years, the area has been getting a lot of tourists due to easy road access, but you can also take a flight there. When in Rara, make sure you hike up to Murma to get a view you will never forget.
Phoksundo is the deepest lake in Nepal. It is an alpine freshwater oligotrophic lake located in Shey-Phoksundo National Park. Trekking the entire national park would be the best thing to do to reach this water tourism destination, but if you do not have time, you have to get there and walk the narrow trail with blue turquoise water by your side.
People who go to Tilicho will never forget it for two reasons. The trek to Tilicho is hard. It is probably the hardest lake out of all on our water tourism destination list to get to. But, once you are there, you will be in awe of what you see. They say Tilicho is the highest lake in the world, but that is up for debate as much of the Himalayas is still unexplored, but it is a beautiful destination to go to.
Gokyo is a jewel of the Everest region. It is very cold out there, but the views of the lake from Gokyo Ri is too good to miss out on. If you are trekking up to Gokyo, you also get to see Everest from afar and get to spend time in Namche Bazar, also known as the Sherpa capital.
Mostly known as a pilgrimage site, Panch Pokhari in Sindupalchok is not only a water tourism destination but also a gem of a trek. Sunrise, sunsets and five small ponds, the place mesmerises you, not to mention the mighty Jugal Himal from where the sun rises. The best time to go there is November because the skies are clear and the views are stupendous.
Located in Rolwalling valley, in Dolakha, this glacial lake seldom gets visitors. Apart from the lake, you also get to see Gaurishankar up close and walk to remote villages. A trek to this water tourism destination is challenging, but it is full of amazing facets of nature to make it a trip worth heading for.
Another glacial lake, Kapuche, is more of a pond than an actual lake. It is small and is a place that a few decades ago was ice. The place is worth a visit just to see how much global warming has affected the Himalayas. It is also a place where you get to see a lot of avalanches falling down into the glacier from the steep peaks of Annapurna II.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/water-tourism-destinations-nepal.html,travel
Buddha Air to resume Kathmandu-Varanasi flight from April 1,"Sunday, February 27, 2022","Kathmandu, February 27
Buddha Air, a leading domestic airline operator of the country, says it will resume the Kathamandu-Varanasi flight from April 1.
This was the company’s only international flight before the Covid-19 crisis, but the pandemic had forced it to suspend the service.
As the virus infection is on the wane, the company has decided to resume the flight after over two years.
The company, however, is yet to make public the weekly schedule.
As this route connects two religious pilgrimage sites in the neighbouring countries, the service was popular among Hindus in both Nepal and India.

7 useful tips to save money during your Nepal travel,"Monday, February 21, 2022","They say Nepal is a backpacker’s paradise. But, that is not true because, over the course of the past two decades, Nepal has become quite expensive. The rooms cost more, and food prices are skyrocketing along with the transportation cost. So how can a backpacker still enjoy the Nepal travel on his/her $20 a day budget?
Well, we have got some ideas for you. While this might not go down well with the government or the hospitality industry, these ideas can save you a lot of $$.
Check them out if you want to learn how to save money during your Nepal travel.
If you are in Kathmandu during your Nepal travel, use the ride-sharing apps available to commute because most taxis in the valley will rip you off. Since you are a foreigner, they will most likely charge double the price and will not bargain with you. To avoid this, install ride-sharing applications like Pathao or Tootle and pay normal rates. If not, the Kathmandu valley is quite small, you can just walk. These applications are not available away from the valley, so it is better to walk or take the public bus. In Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, cabs are ridiculously expensive so just walk because unless you do that, things will not change your Nepal travel cost.
When Nepalis sees a foreigner, they think dollars. They charge you extra for everything. So please bargain as much as possible during your Nepal travel or else you will end up paying a lot more than you should. If the shop does not say “fixed price”, it is most likely charging you double the price, so try and haggle a bit. Who knows s/he might sell it to you at the price you quoted?
A lot of restaurants in the valley charge a lot of money for a small portion of food. They do this to Nepalis too and if you want to avoid such places during your Nepal travel, try the local eateries close to where you are staying at. If you are a meat lover who can handle your spices, you shall love a nice Newa food place that can be found in almost all major tourist parts of the country. If you are vegetarian, there are sweet shops that will have a range of vegetable delicacies that will fill you up.
Another way to save money during Nepal travel is ditching hotels to stay in hostels. People might think hostels are bad, but there are some in Kathmandu and Pokhara that are quite nice and offer beds for as little as $5. You also get half-decent hotel rooms at $10 so that can also be considered, but do not pay anything above that as people might try and rip you off in other ways.
Nepal Tourism Board recommends a foreigner trek with a tour guide during your Nepal travel due to chances of getting lost. But, if you carry a map and go to places where there will be a lot of fellow trekkers like Annapurna Circuit, Annapurna Base Camp, Mardi Himal or Everest, you will be fine. Taking a guide will only increase your expense because most of them are not as well trained as you might want them to be. But, bear in mind, it is quite important to take a tour guide to untrodden places like Makalu, Kanchenjunga or anywhere around far-west Nepal because these trails are not marked well. If you do want a local to join you, make friends along the way but do not get conned by sweet talks that are everywhere.
Flight tickets for tourists are ridiculously priced, so always take a bus to travel between cities if you want to save money during your Nepal travel. If you want to make the commute even cheaper, take local buses. Travelling in these buses takes a lot of time, but it also saves you a lot of money. Check fare rates at the bus stop before boarding and brace yourself for an adventure.
This might not go down too well with the authorities, but seriously, paying $10 or above to get to Banastapur, Patan or Bhaktapur Durbar squares is a ripping-off. So try and sneak in via many alleys that lead into the heritage sites. You do not get into trouble right away and if caught, you can pay for the ticket, but be a bit smart and try not to pay because most of these areas are quite overrated. Look for these entry points on the internet or a map or YouTube.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/save-money-nepal-travel.html,travel
Resham Firiri alternatives: 6 easy Nepali songs for foreigners,"Saturday, February 19, 2022","Music has always played an important part in making the surroundings more pleasant. Whether it is singing songs during a long tour or indoor to lift the mood, there is music for every mood. Nepali songs are no different.
Music also pulls people closer together. It has, on many occasions, demonstrated that it is the most understood global language. But when a foreigner is introduced to Nepali music, they are most probably made familiar with ‘Resham Firiri’. However, Nepali music is much more than that, and there are many more easy, peppy and interesting songs to start with.
So, if you are trying to get familiar with Nepali music and also learn the language with it, here are some simple yet catchy Nepali songs you can sing.
Durga Lal Shrestha wrote this lovely, soothing song, which is performed by Ani Choying Dolma. This song’s lyrics, inspired by the philosophies of Buddhism, make it one of the most popular Nepali songs among the people here. This has reached 2.2 m views on YouTube. It is a lovely song to listen to while travelling, and the lyrics are simple and catchy.
It goes ’Phulko aankhaa maa phulai sansara, kaandako aankhaa maa kaandai sansara’ (if you are a flower, you will see the world as a flower; if you are a thorn, you will see a thorn). It simply means your perception of the world is a reflection of yourself. It repeats quite a few times so you can hum it next time you hear it.
This love song was penned and sung 25 years ago by Nabin K Bhattarai. This song is from his album Raharai Raharma, which made him a household name in Nepal almost overnight. His music video for this song was recently released and has had over 1 million views already. It is both romantic and catchy, and you might just find yourself falling in love with it.
The song says ‘Aankhaa maa timilai, pauchhu ma dherai dherai’ which means whenever he closes his eyes, he sees his lover, and finds her there forever. The song is an expression his feelings, of his love. The song further says he loves her so much that he sees her even in his dreams and wants to spend the rest of his life together. So it should be pretty easy to follow.
‘Kutu maa kutu’ is another superhit song released in 2017. This song appeared in the Nepali film Dui Rupaiya. It was written and sung by Rajan Raj Shiwakoti along with Melina Rai and Rajan Ishan, and was directed by Asim Shah.
This song became the first Nepali YouTube video to reach 100 million views on December 22, 2017, and still is the most viewed Nepali video on YouTube, with over 150 million views. This is one of the best and easiest Nepali songs to listen to when travelling or just to kill time or even dance to it because it is everywhere.
The main chorus for this song is ‘Kutu maa kutu supadi dana, kutu maa kutu’ and means supadi (betelnuts) being cracked and chewed. Kutukutu, the onomatopoeia, refers to the sound it makes. This may or may not make sense, to foreign listeners, and the lyrics might even feel fast-paced to follow. But, it is still worth it even if you learn just the chorus. The music video is also entertaining to watch.
Tulsi Gajmer wrote and composed the song ‘Asaare mahinaa maa’, inspired by Nepali migrant workers in Darjeeling, India. It was sung by Chhujang Dukpa, with Aruna Lama joining in on the chorus. It is about a male migrant worker, who is abroad for work and is remembering his family, in particular, his young son. This song was released back in 2005 and it was immediately admired by many. Its popularity was boosted by Prashant Tamang singing it on the Indian Idol (2007).
‘Asaare mahinaa maa’ refers to the third month in the Nepali calendar (June/ July) when it is monsoon season in Nepal. The song goes ‘Asaare mahinaa maa, paani paryo rujhaune, eklo yo mero man kasari bujhaune’ (it is the monsoon rain, one that can drench me, but how do I convince my lonely heart). This Nepali song has a slow tempo, is emotional, and is easy to follow.
This is an older song, but it is still popular among Nepali music fans. Chandani Shah composed the song and legendary Tara Devi provided her voice. This is one of the singer’s most popular songs, and her soothing voice in this song is highly appreciated. Although ‘Ukaali Oraali’ was released before 1990, it is still one of the popular Nepali songs of today. You can even hum it; it is sure to get you in the good books of the elder generation.
To give you a peek, the singer sings, ‘Ukaali oraali harumaa…. Jaha jaha janchhau timi, ma paila bani pachhyayi rahanchu’. It means no matter wherever her loved one goes, anywhere in the world, she will always follow him like a shadow and be together although she may not be physically present.
Another popular song is ‘Parelimaa’ from the band 1974 AD and was released in 1998. From their album Samjhi Baschhu, this Nepali song became a smashing hit when it first came out because the song was acoustic, simple and genuine. It had a simple feel to it, evoking romanticism and is still a fan favourite. There are many covers of this song you can check as well.
The song goes ‘Pareli maa lukai rakha na, angaalo maa bandhi rakha’ where the singer is expressing his love by requesting his lover to hide him in her eyes and embrace him. This song is the best one to start with because it is slow, easy and speaks about the love that is a universal language too, like music.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/6-easy-nepali-songs-for-foreigners.html,travel
6 easy family hiking destinations in Kathmandu,"Thursday, February 17, 2022","When it comes to family activities, Kathmandu does not have a lot to offer. Movies and restaurants are the go-to place for families but can be done anytime. There are places like Kathmandu Funpark, Kathmandu Fun Valley and Whoopeeland, but even these get boring once you visit them. There is one activity though that is an ideal family activity – hiking.
Why family hiking? It will keep all of you fit; you are out in nature which will make your children curious and it is a great chance to unwind away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
When it comes to family hiking, Kathmandu has many places. In fact, there is a spot for everyone. There are places for the pro-hikers who want to walk for 10 hours plus and there are moderate ones. For families, however, both of these options might be a bit too much, so, today, we bring you a list of short family hiking routes which offer great views without walking as much.
Bishnudwar is probably the easiest hiking spot in the valley. Located in the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park, the place can be reached halfway by car or bike, after which you have to walk for around an hour to reach the source of the Bishnumati river. The place is calm and soothing. The walk to it is also quite pleasant as it is mostly flat until the climb up to Bishnudwar. The view of the valley on a clear day is just jawdropping. A recommended spot for family hiking as well as for those involving novice hikers…
Boson Danda near Taudaha lake is another easy yet interesting family hiking destination. The hike to Boson Danda can start from different places. You can start from Taudaha itself if you do not want to walk much or start it from either Kirtipur or Bhaisepati. You have to walk a bit more from Kirtipur, but the climb is not much but the trail does take past old settlements and forests. The view from Boson Danda, also known as White House, is just breathtaking. You can see the grandeur of the Kathmandu valley to the north with mountains like Manaslu, Langtang and Ganesh.
The hike to Chandragiri is underrated. Before the cable car was set up, the only way to get to the top was through a rugged trail that took only motorbikes, bicycles and hikers. The trial from the bottom to the top takes around four hours, walking mostly through forests filled with different flora and fauna. The view from the top is just sublime too as you get a 360 view from where you can see different mountains to the north. If tired to take the walk back down, you can take the cable car ride.
Chisapani is another ideal destination for short family hiking as well as hiking with friends. The trail that starts from Sundarijal climbs up to Chisapani through rhododendron forests. The hike takes around four hours as it takes you to a nice little settlement that people are sure to fall in love with. To the north are the snow-capped mountains which just adds to the beauty of an already pretty place. If lucky, you might also get to spot a few wild animals.
Hiking to Jamacho in Nagarjun is an easy and short hike within the valley. The hike starts a little further from Balaju Bypass and takes around three hours to get to the top. The place is also famous for Nagarjuna’s cave where he performed meditation. From the top of Jamacho Gumba, you can see the Kathmandu valley to the east and the mountain range to the north. If you do not want to hike to this family hiking destination, you can take your car to the top of the hill.
This is another hiking spot located in the Shivapuri area that is short and family-friendly. The trail starts from Jagadol in Gorkarneshwar and climbs high through pine forest and Buddhist prayer flags. The common trail to Tarebhir is through the ISKCON temple in Budanilkantha but post-Covid, this route has come to more use. The trail is simple and pleasant and roughly takes around two hours to get to the top, making it a favourable family hiking destination.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/easy-family-hiking-in-kathmandu.html,travel

8 top places to visit in and around Jiri,"Monday, February 7, 2022","Most Nepalis must have heard a cliche about Jiri that the place is called the Switzerland of Nepal. The name of the place also reminds some people of Mt Everest as it was called the gateway to Everest in the past.
Other than this, people know very little about this heaven, Jiri, a beautiful town in the Dolakha district situated in central Nepal. But, other than just two accolades, this place has so much to offer to free-spirited travellers. And, here is a list of some of the places one should not miss while visiting around Jiri.
The Chyordong hill is a common religious site for both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims. As this place lies on the top of the Jiri valley, it is one of the popular viewpoints of Jiri. The views of Numbur, Gaurishankar and Rolwaling mountain ranges look stunning from here. Besides, one can also enjoy the splendid view of Lamabagar, Kalinchok, Sailung and Sindhuligadhi from this hill station.
The Sikri valley, the place of origin of the Jirel community, lies on the bank of the Sikri river. This valley presents you with the authentic art, culture, language, costumes and lifestyle of the Jirel community. There is also Sikri Jirel Homestay in this valley.
Gurans Park, open ground in the middle of the Thulonagi community forest area, is surrounded by lush green forests. This forest is home to different species of rhododendron trees. The views of various mountain ranges from this park are just awesome to witness.
Another attractive park in Jiri is situated on the eastern border of Jiri municipality, Pumpa of Shyama. There are hundreds of big stones decorated in an artistic way in this wide meadow. A two hours’ ride from Jiri Bazaar through Mali Alung takes you to this park.
Hanumante is the only hill in Dolakha from where you can enjoy the panoramic view of the whole district. The famous tourist destinations of the district such as Kalinchok Bhagawati, Dolakha Bhimsen, Sailung Thumka, mountainous range stretching from Number Himal on the east to Langtang on the west can be seen from the Hanumante hill station. Besides the views, there is also an imprint of hands and feet of Lord Hanuman on the centre of this cliff. On the bottom, there is a super huge cave where lies the Hanumanteswhwr temple.
The Lauti jharana (waterfall) falls from the height of 50 metres. This stream is three km away from Manedada, Jiri. There is a legend behind its name. In the past, a shaman named Lauti used to bathe in this stream and used to take the children who would come near that stream for grazing the cattle. Thus, she would teach them tantrism and witchcraft.
This park was established in the memory of veteran Swiss geologist Tony Hegan. Incorporating the Gokulganga community forest area, this park features diverse flora including varieties of medicinal herbs. There is also a statue of Tony Hegan in the heart of this park.
Besides, there is also plenty of religious site inside this park such as Dhungeshwari Mahadev, Gokuleshwar Mahadev temple along with numerous caves and streams. On the top of this park, there lies Ramite Danda, from where you can enjoy the view of the whole Jiri Bazaar.
Both the ponds situated at an altitude of 4,500 m, at a one-hour walking distance from each other are significant religious sites in Jiri. A big fair is held on the day of Janai Purnima every year. These ponds (pokharis) are the origin of the Khimti river. One can trek to these pokharis passing from Stone park. It takes two days to reach here from Jiri Bazaar.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visit-jiri-nepal.html,travel
Surkhet now offers its visitors paragliding too,"Sunday, February 6, 2022","Surkhet, February 6
Paragliding is being launched in the Surkhet valley, the capital of the Karnali province, today. The venue for the adventure sport is Bayalkanda and Deutithan of Birendranagar municipality.
It aims to promote adventure tourism in the Karnali province, says the sport operator Padam Bahadur Shahi.
Earlier in the mid-2010s, attempts to operate paragliding on a regular basis failed due to various reasons.
“Earlier, we tried to operate paragliding in Surkhet. But, a lack of human resources thwarted our attempt. Surkhet is suitable for the sport in terms of geography and weather. Arrangements have been made for emergency landing too,” he says.
Welcome Paragliding Pvt Ltd has received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal to operate the sport for one year. It has partnered with the Babu Adventure in Pokhara for the sport and has hired 12 pilots.
The paragliding flight fee is fixed at 3,500 per person. To attract customers, there are discounts too.
A group of five people can enjoy a flight for Rs 3,200 per person in a package. Likewise, a group of 10 people has to pay Rs 2,800 per person and a group of more than 10 people Rs 2,500.
One has to pay additional Rs 1,000 for taking photos and videos while flying. The time for a flight is 20 minutes at one go.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/surkhet-paragliding.html,travel
10 things every traveller should know before visiting Nepal,"Saturday, February 5, 2022","Planning a trip to Nepal? Great! Nepal is an amazing country with lots of things to do. It is also one of the cheapest countries in Asia for your vacation, which you can enjoy without regret. But, to optimise the vacation, there are some things you must know before visiting Nepal.
Here are some basic things you need to know before visiting Nepal:
Unlike what most people think, Nepal is a separate, sovereign country and not an extension of India or China. If you have booked tickets already, you might know this, but a disclaimer is still in place.
Nepal is a mountainous country with an average elevation of 3,265 m. It is also home to the eight out of 14 tallest mountains in the world, and the best place for those interested in mountain climbing, hiking and trekking. But, this also means roads are hard to travel and rough in the mountainous and hilly regions.
The best time to visit Nepal is between October and December when the skies are clear and the weather is calm and dry. This is perfect for time for adventurous activities.
In January and February, the winter prevails in Nepal. This time is perfect if you want to refresh, look at beautiful skies from Namche Bazaar or have a quiet and overall pleasant trekking session thanks to a low number of travellers during these months.
And, if you want to fully enjoy the natural beauty of Nepal, the best time is during late May when the spring starts and the flowers like rhododendrons start blooming, making for an amazing sight to behold.
There are lots of great places in Nepal that you would not want to miss. But visiting all of those places will take you a lot of time. So, for starters, get a tourist guide or find a group for yourself. It will save you a lot of time and will be a lot easier to trek and hike.
The must-visit place to start is the Pashupatinath temple, one of the historic Hindu temples, which is not too far from the international airport. Another would be all the durbar square areas in the Kathmandu valley, each representing its own unique history, architecture and culture. Outside Kathmandu, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, Lumbini, is also a great place to 5isit because of its historical and religious importance. Other naturally rich sites are Chitwan, Khaptad, and Rara.
Getting a tourist visa to Nepal is not that complicated. You can simply apply for a visa online within 15 days before the date of arrival in Nepal. All you need is the address of your hotel room you are staying in in Nepal and a recent digital version of your passport-size photo that you can upload in your application.
But, Nepal also offers on-arrival visas, which have been suspended now due to the Covid-19 crisis. Else, you can get your visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport and costs you USD 25-100 (in cash) per single entry. Prices are also determined by your trip duration which might be around 15-90 days. And, extending a visa is also pretty easy here and are only allowed to stay up to 150 days since your arrival in Nepal.
If you are visiting Nepal for the first time and are wondering where to stay, you do not have to. From five-star hotels to affordable hostels, everything is available according to your budget. The Dwarika’s Hotel, Kathmandu Marriott hotel, Babermahal Villa might be great options if you are looking for the best lounging experience in Kathmandu. But, if you want a budget hotel, there are plenty of such options too with great services. Do your research carefully and confirm services you need with the hotels before booking.
If you looking for lounging outside the Kathmandu valley, there are plenty of hotel options too, especially in major hubs like Pokhara and Chitwan. You will also get hostel and homestay options, for a cheaper more authentic travel experience.
The cost of visiting Nepal is pretty cheap and so is travelling around Nepal. Prices will vary from place to place, but around USD 25-30 is enough for your daily expenses in Nepal including food and decent accommodation. Avoid buying foods inside airports or tourist destinations as they might cost you more. Travelling around Kathmandu in a taxi will cost you way more than travelling in a public vehicle.
One thing you might want to prepare is for the entrance fees. In heritage sites and other popular tourist attractions, you will need to pay; eg Kathmandu Durbar Square will charge you USD 10 per entrance, Swyambhu Stupa costs USD 2 and Pashupatinath temple will cost you USD 10.
For trekking and mountain climbing, also consider permit fees and national park entrance fees.
If you ever visit Nepal, you must try local and authentic cuisines, no matter which part of the country you travel to. But, what you need to understand is that Nepali local foods are filled with spices. If you are not used to it, you might have problems with digestion. It is better to avoid spicy foods. Take caution and keep medicines at your disposal if you are keen to try all.
Also, local people are not familiar with the concept of food allergies or intolerance [gluten, dairy]. So, if you have an allergy or intolerance to any food, please let the hotel or your host know beforehand. You can research the food in the area you are travelling to and make a list. It is for your own safety.
Before you come to Nepal, you need to understand what you can do and cannot do in this country to avoid all problems that can arise from misunderstanding or cultural gap.
Mountain climbing and trekking is very common in Nepal. But, do not go trekking or do any type of activity alone. Hiring a guide might be a good idea since English is not a commonly used language outside Kathmandu. Bringing any sort of weapon or drugs can be considered illegal in Nepal, so avoid it at all cost.
Public display of affection like kissing should also be avoided since it is considered inappropriate in Nepali culture.
Nepal’s flag is the only non-quadrilateral flag that represents a country. It consists of two juxtaposed triangles with a crimson-coloured base and deep blue borders. It has a white crescent moon with eight rays in the upper part and a white twelve rayed sun in the lower part.
People’s sentiments, as well as the constitution, require you to respect the flag. Damaging, stepping over it, discarding and disrespecting flag can result in a three-year jail sentence or NRs 30,000 fine or both. Unlike in other countries, you have to be very careful about making merchandise out of Nepal’s flag. Using colours is okay, but it is considered immensely disrespectful to wear Nepal’s flag in anything below the belt areas. Printing flags on other pieces of clothing also needs to be done with caution and respect.
Nepal also has a strict mathematical description of how the flag should be made. It has provisions on who can hoist the flag and when.
With the pandemic taking its toll, all people coming to Nepal will be required to have papers proving either a negative Covid-19 test or that you have taken the vaccine. Follow self-quarantine and, afterwards, wear a mask all the time when you are outside to reduce the risk of transmission.
Other than this, the government has recommended travellers get vaccinations for some most common diseases in Nepal including malaria, polio, hepatitis A and B, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, yellow fever, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), flu, chickenpox, DPT, etc. Avoid interactions with street animals as they may transmit fleas or diseases which you do not want.
Because Nepal is a developing country, health facilities might not be available, outside Kathmandu, whenever needed, so take necessary precautions. Try to carry your water while travelling since purified water is not easily available everywhere in Nepal.
Lastly, public toilets are not as you imagined here in Nepal. Most of these public toilets are not maintained or cleaned properly. So try to avoid them or enter at your own risk. In long, forest routes, they are even less. Also, always carry your sanitiser or soap.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/traveller-visiting-nepal-should-know.html,travel
10 classic Nepali songs from before 1990 that you should add to your playlist,"Saturday, February 5, 2022","Nepal’s musical history is short as musicians started recording their music only after the establishment of Radio Nepal in 1952. Radio Nepal became an important platform and gave a wide range of audiences to the legendary musicians like Shiva Shankar, Narayan Gopal, Gopal Yonjan, Tara Devi, Aruna Lama, Arun Thapa, Koili Devi and so on. These artists did not only became household names for the people but also established the golden era of the Nepali music industry.
To celebrate the treasured generation of Nepali music industry, we are making a list of the greatest classic Nepali songs of all time that you should add to your playlist. And, as Hari Bansha Acharya’s character, Sur Mandal, in Maha’s Sur Besur would say, “Lakhaun geet chhan” (there are lakhs of songs), it is one of the most difficult lists we have ever made.
There are a few ground rules that we set up before making this list. First, we are featuring only one song of an artist. Second, we are not featuring folk songs of that era as we believe the folk songs deserve their own list. Third, we will only feature songs that are recorded before 1990. And, ranking them will be an insult to the artists so these Nepali songs are not being ranked.
The first song on our list is Ghulam Ali’s Lolayeka Ti Thula. And, it was an immense internal struggle to feature the Deepak Jungam-Ghulam Ali collaboration as there were other songs which are equally powerful and beautiful such as Gaajalu Ti Thula Thula Aakha, Kina Kina Timro Tasbir and Ke Chha Ra Diu. It has one of the most beautiful lyrics, penned by MBB Shah (the alias adopted by King Mahendra for his literary works) and is a perfect example of the prominence of the late king in literature. Jungum’s music is equally beautiful and one of his finest works. And, about Ali’s voice, we are out of superlatives to describe.
You can listen to other Ghulam Ali songs here:
From Deepak Kharel’s esteemed songs collection which includes prolific songs such as Timro Tyo Hasilo Muhaara Ko, Baadal Banaideu, Samjhana Ko Goreto Ma, Purnima Ko Raat Pani and countless others, we choose Pratiksha Gara. Magical and mystical as Kharel’s vocal prowess can get, Sambhujeet Baskota’s composition also surely paved way for him to become one of the greatest musicians of the country. Rajendra Rijal’s lyrics is also at its finest and represents one of the greatest lyrical eras of the music’s history.
You can listen to Deepak Kharel’s best songs here:
Selecting a song of Narayan Gopal gave us migraine. The singer, who is given the title of Swar Samrat (literally translates to the Emperor of Voice), has so many hits that choosing one feels like an insult to the others. Narayan Gopal is one of the greatest musicians ever produced and his songs are still celebrated by old and new generations alike. Listen to the song and you will know why. Kali Prasad Rijal is also one of the greatest songwriters in Nepali music history and the song is the perfect example of why he is considered so.
You can listen to the esteemed collection of Narayan Gopal’s songs here:
Bhakta Raj Acharya is such a pitch-perfect singer that he would not mis-sing even a semi note. One of the finest and celebrated singers of the Nepali music industry, Acharya, though, had to retire from singing at his peak due to cancer in his tongue. Acharya, who is also referred to as Bhajan Shiromani, has given us many legendary songs such as Jati Chot Dinchhau, Jaha Chhan Buddha Ka Aankha, Hajar Sapana, Hajar Aankha, Maya Meri Saanjha Bani and many more. And, with an acknowledgement that these are some of the greatest songs in history, we pick his song Mutu Jali Rahechha on our list.
Acharya’s best songs can be listened to, here:
The next song on our list is Kati Kamjor Rahechha Bhagya by Deep Shrestha, with lyrics penned by Yuban Manandhar. Deep Shrestha is one fine composer, who has given us many magical songs such as Biteka Kura, Ma ta Dur Dekhi Aayen, Hu Yatri, Har Raat Sapani ma, Mero Aankha Ma and many more.
You can listen to the greatest songs by Deep Shrestha here:
Another legendary musician in our list is Gopal Yonjan, who has composed many songs such as Chyangba hoi Chyangba (sung with Gyanu Rana), Kahile Kahi Mann Ka Kura (sung by Udit Narayan Jha), Jeevan Ko Harek Mod Ma (sung by Narayan Gopal and Aruna Lama), Galti Hajaar Hunchhan (sung by Narayan Gopal) and many more. But, we put his song Mero Pau Ma on our list, which we believe is one of his greatest works with classical roots, high tempo, extraordinarily beautiful lyrics and the magical voices of Yonjan and Meera Rana.
Yonjan’s greatest works can be listened to here:
An artist gone too soon, Arun Thapa was a precious gem who rose into prominence in the 1970s and ruled the Nepali music industry for three decades before dying in 1999 due to lung and liver ailment. A poll conducted in 165 countries by BBC in 2002 to list the 10 greatest songs of all time, his song Ritu Haru Ma Timi was voted as the 7th greatest song. His other songs such as Jati Maya Laae Pani, Saanjh Ko Joon Sangai, Bhulun Bhulun Lagyo Malai, Ma Roe Pani and many more are still one of the most celebrated songs today and are on lips of the common people. But, his song, Chot Ke Ho Byatha Ke Ho makes our list as one of the greatest Nepali classic songs of all time.
You can listen to Arun Thapa’s greatest songs here:
Tara Devi, also referred to as the Nightingale of Nepal sang over 4,000 songs in her lifetime. She is considered one of the greatest singers of all time and has inspired almost every female singers of the country. Her most beloved songs include Phool Ko Thunga, Kaali Paari Dai Kati Raamro, Soche Jasto Hunna Jiwan, Parwati Ho Naam, Phoolai Phool Ko Mausam and countless others. And, to pick one song from her legendary discography was the most painful one for us. But, without disrespecting her other songs, we choose Ukali Orali on our list. Composed by Naati Kaaji Shrestha, the song includes lyrics from another royal family member in Chandani Shah, an alias taken by late Queen Aishwarya.
You can listen to Tara Devi’s greatest songs here:
Like Tara Devi, Aruna Lama was one of the finest female singers in Nepali music and considered a pioneer in Nepali music. Her notable songs include Pohor Saal, Eh Kaanchha Malai Soon Ko Tara, Yeti Dherai, Eklai Basda, Bhettinu Chuttinu and many more. And, for our list, we choose the song Phool Lai Sodhei, which we believe is one of the finest songs composed by Karma Yonjan, with lyrics penned by Norden Rumba.
Aruna Lama’s greatest songs can be found here:
Phatteman Rajbhandari is an iconic singer who gave us legendary songs such as Banai Khayo Dandhelo Le, Esto Pani Hundo Raichha, Sannani Ko Gaalai ma, Raktim and so on. His song, Marna Baru Garho Hunna, has one of the saddest lyrics (like many others on our list) and is a classic that gives you tragic feelings even when you are single. Such is the power of the song and therefore made to our list of the greatest classic songs of all time.
Phatteman’s other songs can be listened to here:

Barpak in Gorkha is underrated as a tourism destination. These photos are the evidence,"Wednesday, February 2, 2022","Yellow paddy, clear skies and warm people: Gorkha welcomed me warmly this autumn. The weather was great as was the food. I like the pace at which the village life moves and that is what took me to my home – Rana Gaun.
I like living in Kathmandu. But, there is something special about coming back home especially during the autumn. The mountains usually open up, the fields are painted in a yellow hue and there is a fresh breeze around. Not many people go to Gorkha, but I firmly believe they should as there are so many underrated places in the district. One of them is Barpak.
Many people know Barpak due to the 2015 earthquake as it was the epicentre. The earthquake did a lot of damage to the village. Many died as most of its traditional houses were reduced to rubble.
But, that was six years ago.
Things are getting a lot better. The reconstruction drive that took place in the village has been positive, but it needs support from local tourists.
That is what took me to Barpak. I had been there before, but I wanted to see what had changed. So with a friend, I embarked on the journey to Barpak and its surrounding.
Walking out of Rana Gaun and into Barpak was fun. There were children playing tag and posing for photographs as they saw me approaching with a camera over my neck. Men and women were busy harvesting paddy as old men sat outside the house, smoking cigarettes. The weather was clear and the air was crisp. It was as if the weather wanted me to go there.
The view from Barpak is quite magical too. There was a yellow hue around due to fall colours and ripening paddy. Behind them were the houses with the majestic Manaslu as its backdrop. That was to the north; to the south, you can see a sea of hills, one higher than the other.
That is not all. Before Barpak comes Sulikot, a village that has so much to offer. Viewpoints, temples and even a cave. There were times I felt I would not go back.
The place has changed. The earthquake changed the face of Gorkha. But, despite that, the place still has its essence and I have tried to capture them for you.

"Full Circle, an all-black (and brown) team, eyes Everest summit this year to signify inclusion in and out of Nepal","Monday, January 31, 2022","In the summer of 2013, Phil Henderson, James ‘KG’ Kagambi and Rosemary Saal stood at the top of Denali, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the first ascent of the mountain. For Kagambi and Saal, this moment was special as they along with a few others had become members of the first all-black team to reach the highest point of North America. Even though Henderson was not part of this team, he was brimming with pride seeing how far their community had come when it came to climbing.
Fast forward nearly nine years, this team of black climbers have assembled once again. This time, their goal is a little higher than Denali. The Full Circle team, led by Henderson, is planning to summit the highest mountain in the world, Everest, as it wants to become the first black and brown team to even attempt to climb Everest this spring. Through this, the nine-member team hopes to inspire a young generation of black and brown people along with those underrepresented as they believe that this is an opportunity to draw more people in from these communities into climbing.
“Climbing is something that has been primarily been a western white person’s activity. But, we want to change that and show these young people that nothing is beyond your reach if you really want to do it,” says Henderson, the Full Circle leader.
He had been playing with the idea to do this for quite some time, but he needed everything to work out. First, he needed a team of people interested in climbing a daunting mountain like Everest. Second, they needed everyone to be on the same page. Lastly, this team would need funding because an expedition to Everest is expensive.
So it was not until 2019 that things started to fall into place. Henderson knew he had to take Kagambi on board because he knew what he would bring to the Full Circle. As for Saal, he had been mentoring her ever since they first met on Denali in 2013. As time passed, he started to meet more like-minded people.
Climbing gym owner Abby Dione joined the team along with The North Face athlete Manoah Ainuu. Word started to spread out in the community and that is how entrepreneur Thomas Moore joined the Full Circle. High school teacher Eddie Taylor, sociology professor Demond Mullins and data scientist Fred Campbell joined when they heard about the project from Henderson.
“Everyone was excited about the project because in their climbing journey, they haven’t been fortunate enough to climb with black people. I’ve been doing this for over three decades and I haven’t done it,” says Henderson.
To get the Full Circle members accustomed to Nepal, Henderson brought all of them to Nepal recently. They spent over a week in Phortse in Khumbu, learning about Nepal, the Sherpa culture and getting to know Nepali mountaineers who will help him on Everest.
“It’s been great,” says Taylor. “I got to learn things here and I can’t wait to come back.”
For Taylor, like most black men growing up in the US, climbing was an afterthought. He was into sports like basketball or American football. But, when he started climbing, he fell in love with it.
“I think I got into climbing by accident, but I’ve loved every bit of it. Even though there weren’t many black climbers to look up to, it didn’t bother me as I was in a zone of my own,” says Taylor.
Most of them in the Full Circle feel people do not feel comfortable while climbing because they do not see people like them. This team of black and brown climbers want to change that.
“This is a good opportunity,” says Henderson.
While a majority of the Full Circle members are from the United States, Kagambi is from Kenya but has climbed all across Africa, Europe and North America. But, when Henderson approached him to be a part of the expedition, he was not sure. As an outdoor instructor, Kagambi has a lot of experience but as he has reached his 60s, he was a bit sceptical about going to Everest.
“When I was young, I wanted to become the first black African to climb Everest. But due to financial constraint and lack of opportunity, that dream never became a success,” says Kagambi.
He had achieved a lot in his career and had a feeling that fate did not want him to climb Everest, but then came the phone call from Henderson which, once again, made him dream.
“Living in Kenya, I hadn’t spoken to this group properly until we came to Nepal. Now that I’ve met everyone, I’m excited about what we can do on Everest this spring,” he adds.
The Full Circle project is huge for all of them, and they are aware of the risk that a mountain like Everest poses. Its mortality rate of 14 per cent is daunting to everyone, and all of these climbers know the risk that comes with climbing Everest.
That is why Henderson brought them to Nepal and took them to the Khumbu Climbing Centre where he has been teaching Nepali climbers the basics of safety in the mountains.
“We know how important safety is. Mountains like these are dangerous and we will not be letting our egos take control of us and tackle it as a team,” says Saal.
That is is why Henderson says what the Full Circle wants to do is have fun, climb and build community engagement and share each other’s experiences.
“Everest is going to be hard and they know that, which is why I’ve been telling them that there is no summit guarantee. The summit is always a bonus,” says Henderson.
He says that this is also a good progression for everyone in the Full Circle team and they have been climbing mountains in the Americas and Africa.
“I think it’s to be hard but I’m ready to tackle it,” says Moore, who is on the quest to climb the seven summits, seven highest peaks in each continent.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/full-circle-black-inclusion-everest.html,travel
7 luxury places across Nepal for high-end tourists,"Monday, January 31, 2022","They say Nepal is a backpacker’s paradise thanks to all the budget hotels and cheap eateries across the country. But, over the past few decades, there have been people trying to promote Nepal as a high-end tourist destination.
Following Bhutan’s suit, Nepali businesspersons have been trying to cater to the needs of high-end tourists by opening properties that best suit them. While Kathmandu has always had places like Dwarika’s Hotel, Hyatt Regency and Soaltee Crowne Plaza, properties similar to their stature are popping up away from the valley as well. Hotels/resorts targeting high-end tourists have opened in remotest places like the Everest and Annapurna regions while Chitwan and Bardiya have also seen a rise in properties built to cater to them.
These places have state-of-the-art amenities, the friendliest staff and offer an experience worth all the money one says. This, experts believe, will help increase the flow of high-end tourists who are looking for a bit more than just a pretty view.
Today, we bring you a list of these places are that so good that once you get there, you will not want to come back.
Ker and Downey offers tourists a luxurious way to experience the Himalayas. Its cosy lodges are spread across the Annapurna region and offer spectacular views of the mountains. The food is great as is its staff who are well trained and very friendly. It has lodges in Lumle, Birethannti, Ghandruk, Landurk, Majgaon and Dhamups. All of them have clean rooms and running hot showers. For people who want to trek and experience the Annapurnas without giving up on luxury, this is the way forward. It has some really good packages that have been curated keeping high-end tourists in mind.
Spread across the Everest region, Yeti Mountain Home provides high-end tourists with indulgent comfort, high-quality cuisine and a very warm Sherpa hospitality. These lodges are in one of the most remote parts of Nepal yet none of them compromises on anything. The property, especially in Kongde, a hill opposite Namche Bazar, is ridiculously good. The views from there are worth every penny you have paid to get there. An underrated gem… expensive, yes, but underrated.
Set by the Rapti river near the Chitwan National Park, the lodge for high-end tourists combines the natural beauty of its surroundings with understated elegance. Spread eight acres of land, Jagatpur Lodge oozes luxury. While the rest of the resort is similar to others around the place, its USP is the luxury tents that have been imported from South Africa. Inside these tents are rooms that even five-star hotels would be envious of. Imagine going back in time during the time of the Maharajas of Asia; this is what staying here will feel like. Sited on raised platforms, each tent has its own private viewing deck, from where you can sit and stare at the magnificent jungle that is Chitwan National Park.
Many people know about Tiger Tops’ property in Chitwan. But, it also has one in Bardiya and it is even better. Karnali is an intimate lodge with ultra-personal service and expert wildlife guiding for high-end tourists. For wildlife lovers who want to see the elusive Bengal tiger, this is the property to visit. The place is also calming and soothing. Signature rooms each with an adjoining bathroom, Karnali Lodge is the epitome of comfort with a focus on privacy and calm. All of its rooms are designed to minimise their impact on the environment and are adorned in soft natural colours and fabrics and locally sourced furnishings. It is a place that promotes sustainable tourism, so you have another reason to go visit.
The Terraces is a newly opened property in Kathmandu valley. Set on a ridge to the south of Kathmandu valley, the place offers some of the most jaw-dropping views. The sunsets from the place are magical as is the view of the valley with the mountains in the backdrop. The place offers seclusion and exclusivity and a deeper engagement with the natural environment without sacrificing comfort. It is a great spa so why not wind down and relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The Pavilions is an eco-sensitive luxury resort for high-end tourists in Pokhara. Its place has been built to give back to the local community. But that said, it does not compromise luxury. It is a place where luxury meets adventure. By the very definition of glamping, you get the best of both worlds – the comfort and elegance of a villa combined with the beauty and wonder of camping in nature. It is a perfect place to come wind down after a long trek. Believe us, it is worth it.
It is a known fact that Kathmandu once had a lot of palaces. While some have been lost due to urbanisation and earthquakes, there are some that have turned into hotels. One such is the Baber Mahal Villas which is certain to take you back in time. Its interior and décor echo the grand lifestyle of the Ranas who lived here. So if you want to live in the palace of one of the most powerful dynasties in Nepal, this is your place to be.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/high-end-tourist-places-nepal.html,travel

This series, created by journalist duo Bidhya Chapagain and Kamal Kumar, includes unexplored and unheard tales of many ‘common’ people around Nepal. For this, the team wanders all across the country and in the process of story-telling, they also present different travel destinations and stories.

Nepal continues issuing on-arrival visas to vaccinated foreigners amid Covid-19 spike,"Friday, January 21, 2022","Kathmandu, January 21
Although Nepal is currently going through the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the infection of the Omicron variant, the country says it continues to provide on-arrival visas to foreigners who have been fully vaccinated against the infection.
In a notice on Thursday, the Department of Immigration says people with proof of their vaccination and meeting other criteria can apply for the on-arrival visa at the country’s sole international airport, Tribhuvan International Airport, in Kathmandu. The same service will be available at other entry points of the country, bordering India.
Besides the proof of vaccination, the applicants also need to submit a Covid-19 negative test report from a test conducted within the last 72 hours.
Upon arrival, they will be sent to quarantine for five days and will be allowed to come out after another Covid-19 test.
Meanwhile, the department has urged people who are willing to come to Nepal but have not received all required doses of vaccination to apply for a visa at the Nepali diplomatic missions in their own countries.

9 zipline places in Nepal to make your next holiday trip flying high,"Friday, January 21, 2022","Zipline in Nepal has picked up over the past few years. Since it first started in 2010 in Pokhara, eight others have come into existence. This goes to show how popular this adventure activity has become. In fact, there is a lot of demand from people within Nepal. This pastime is so popular that even old heads such as Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna have experienced it in Nepal.
Due to this, more such facilities are being planned in different places around the country.
But, where are these facilities? To help you plan effectively for your next holiday trip, we have made a list of the available zipline places. Here is a list below:
Established in 2010, this is Nepal’s first zipline service. Here, your trip starts at Sarangkot and ends at Hemja in Pokhara. It is one of the steepest ziplines in the world. The facility is 1,850 metres long and has been constructed keeping in mind international safety standards. Highground Adventures says it was helped by American company Zipflyer to put up state of the art technology in place back in 2010 itself.
Close to Kathmandu, this has been able to attract the Kathmandu valley’s youth since it came into operation three years ago. What makes this place unique is two people can do it at the same time. Along with that, it also has a superman zipline where you fly like the son of Krypton for 1,100 metres.
Also called Hetaunda Zipline, this facility is located in Taplakharka Gadhi rural municipality in Makawanpur. It came into operation just before the Covid-19 pandemic. The place is around 18 kilometres from Hetaunda and has been able to attract youth and adventure lovers from there. This facility is 1,100 metres long.
This facility and the one in Makawanpur came into operation almost together. The 650-metre long stretch starts above the clouds in Bhedetar and ends in Devisthan. Its attraction is ever-increasing, but people have been mentioning that it is too short as the experience is over in 45 seconds.
The Parbat district has become a hub for adventure tourism in recent times. The place famous for its long bridge and bungee jump also has a zipline that is 1,480 metres long and has come into operation on January 9, 2022. The stretch runs over the Kaligandaki river and ends at Adventure Resort. People can try the superman zipline here too.
Commonly known as the RSR, the place has started a 200-metre long zipline and has been selling it as a part of its resort package.
Due to its close proximity to the capital city, this 1,200-metre-long stretch is full of people. It is probably the most popular in the entire country. As you zip down, you get to see most of Kathmandu valley, which is quite a treat.
This is also a short length, but it is becoming quite popular among domestic tourists. What started a 100-metre stretch has not been extended to 200 metres. Its popularity rose after pictures of Ramdev doing it went viral on the internet.
This facility is also getting quite popular among domestic tourists. The length is roughly around 1,300 metres and has been doing well despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
Apart from these, there are other projects that are soon to come into operation. River Fun Resort in Kurintar is planning a 550-metre long zipline. With all testing done, this one will come into operation soon, says the resort.
World Wide Adventures, the company operating the facility in Dhulikhel, is planning to start one in Nagarkot too. There is also another one being constructed at Times Resort in Dhading.
Officials of cable car operators in Saragkot inform they are planning a 100-metre zipline there.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/zipline-places-nepal.html,travel
"8 best holiday destinations–besides Everest and Ilam–in Province 1, Nepal’s easternmost region","Wednesday, January 19, 2022","Province 1 that covers most of eastern Nepal is quite underrated when it comes to tourism. Like the far-western part of the country, the east is disregarded as a tourism destination.
Although the Everest region does see a lot of tourists, the rest of Province 1 does not. Ilam does get its fair share of domestic tourists thanks to the tea garden, but tourism entrepreneurs in Province 1 feel the number should be a lot higher as there are a lot of places in the province worth visiting.
Here is a list of places that you should consider if you are planning a trip to Province 1 of Nepal.
Kanchenjunga Base Camp is a trip that will take you into the wilderness of the eastern province of Nepal. Even though it is long, as it takes 21 days to complete it, the trip will take you on a journey. You will walk by lush tropical jungles full of rhododendrons to the base of the third highest mountain in the world. As this trail is hardly walked on by tourists, it is recommended you take a local person with you because you have to pitch up tents in most parts of the trek.
Despite that, it is sure that the mountain life, Sherpa lifestyle, yak settlements, essential herbs, and the region’s natural beauty give you a pleasant experience. This place is ideal for wandering around nature for a few days while taking a break away from the rush of urban life. This region is also home to the elusive snow leopards.
Makalu Barun is a hidden gem. Isolated and remote, this place takes you to the base of Makalu, the fifth highest mountain in the world and the Barun valley, which is one of the prettiest places in the country where you find some of the rarest species in the world.
The trek is full of diverse landscapes. Most of the trail is unpopulated and you a need tent. The trails are not marked very well, but it is pretty straightforward. But, that said, if you do not want to pitch a tent, you will have to walk for around eight hours a day. The best seasons for the Makalu Barun trek in Province 1 are spring and autumn. The spring brings colour to the trek with rhododendron forests. Likewise, the sky is clear during the autumn season.
This holy shrine in Province 1 of the country sees a lot of visitors. While its cultural and religious significance is high, the place itself is nestled on a nice hill that offers some splendid views. Apart from the temple, the area also has monasteries situated in Olangchung Gola and Lungchung. The waterfall at Sawa and the pond of Timbung, during the autumn and spring, are worth visiting every year. The forest ecosystem along the trail offers a diversity of wildlife, birds, flowers and butterflies. The whole of the Kanchanjunga range can be seen in this trek.
Bhedetar in Province 1 is famous for its unpredictable weather. Most of the time, the place is shrouded in fog which makes this hill station mystical. If you like waterfalls, this is also the gateway to Namaste Jharana which is one of the most famous waterfalls in Nepal. Apart from that, there are other activities that one can indulge themselves in like zipline and paragliding. If these activities do not interest you, you can still get there and enjoy the magnificent view of the mountain and valley below the mountains.
Tinjure-Milke-Jaljale is the confluence of three districts of eastern Nepal – Sankhuwasabha, Taplejung and Terhathum. The place is known for its rhododendrons as you can find over 30 species of flower in the area. Sunrise and sunset from the area are also underrated as it is the place that does not get the visitors it deserves. You also get views of Makalu and Everest along with other mountains from the area. You also have the option to go to the highest waterfall in Nepal, the Hyatung Jharana. The best time to get to this place is during the spring because the place blossoms with flowers.
It is a known fact that there are not many things to do around Biratnagar. But if you are there, you have to go to Barju Taal in Barju rural municipality of Sunsari district in Province 1. Peaceful, this is a great place to go wind down in the evening. The place is also home to a lot of migratory birds. As it is close to Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, you get to see other flora and fauna too.
Halesi Mahadev is one of the most important Shiva shrines in the country. Hindus, Buddhists and the Kirats go regularly to this pilgrimage site. The temple is located in a cave that dates back to the 12th century. While the Hindus believe it to be a Shiva shrine, Buddhist believe that it is associated with the legend of Padmasambhava and a place where Vajrayana Buddhism was practised. The Kirats have their own history of the cave that lies between the Sunkoshi and Dudhkoshi rivers.
Bordering Okhaldhunga and Solukhumbu districts, Pattale is another underrated gem in Province 1. The place is located at an altitude of 2,800m, from where you can get a glimpse of Everest. During the spring, the area is painted in a red hue thanks to the rhododendrons. During the winter, the place gets good snowfall too and can be a destination that you can go to enjoy the snow. Getting to the place is quite easy too. The roads are decent enough and if you live in Kathmandu, a bus goes to Pattale every day from Koteshwar. It takes around 10 hours to get there.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/holiday-destinations-province-1-nepal.html,travel
Entrepreneurs want govt to continue tourism activities even amid Omicron threats,"Wednesday, January 12, 2022","Kathmandu, January 12
Tourism entrepreneurs in Nepal have demanded that the government continue tourism activities in the country even amid increased threats of the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
As the government has gradually begun implementing restrictions to control the spread, tourism industrialists say the government should make sure their sector is smooth.
In a recent meeting with the Nepal Tourism Board, the entrepreneurs warned the government against any restriction on the sector as it would cripple the national economy.
Achyut Guragain, the president of the Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents, says there is no alternative to continuing travel activities by following set health protocols and arranging booster doses against the infection.
Likewise, entrepreneur Dambar Parajuli says the government should not give trouble to foreign tourists once they arrive in Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/continue-tourism-omicron.html,travel
Top four destinations you need to visit to beat winter in Nepal,"Saturday, January 8, 2022","When winter comes around, most of us plan to stay warm, by staying indoors. But there are places in Nepal whose charms increase as temperatures plummet. A coat of snow, a crust of frost; frozen waterfalls, and life slowed down so much that you lose track of time. Places that bristle with visitors are empty. The lodge owner who wouldn’t have time to exchange a few words with you in peak season spends entire evenings regaling you with stories. A whole new world opens up in the off-season. Here are popular places that are worth abandoning the warmth of your homes for in winter.
Often times it’s not the weather or the time of year that prevents you from hitting the trail; it’s a dearth of time. Most ideal trekking destinations require a week at the minimum, so you put off the trip until you will have a window of that duration. And more often than not the planned trek slips gets pushed further and further down the bucket list until it is forgotten.
Chisapani is a day’s trek from Kathmandu. That alone is reason enough to go there. The Chisapani trek is like a condensed version of longer treks like the Annapurna circuit. You begin your trek in the morning from Sundarijal, climb to the small village of Mulkharka, walk through a dappled forest, and arrive toward evening to watch a spectacular show of light on a Himalayan façade.
The cold is the only issue on this trek. Everything else – scenic villages, towering mountains, forests teeming with birds – is laid out along the trail like a buffet for the senses.
Poon Hill features big on guidebooks, makes it on every ‘Ten Best Treks in Nepal’ list and is blurted out in excitement by trekkers when asked to recommend a destination. It is famous to the point of being trite. But its fame snares you: you want to go, if only to prove that it’s not a big deal.
Trekking to Poon Hill is not as arduous as some of the other treks. You can get on a bus in Kathmandu, get off at Nayapul, walk to Birethanti, and begin you trek. Villages at regular intervals along the trail mean you can take your time. Lodge owners have been in the business a long time, so they know how to pamper guests.
What makes the Poon Hill trek unique is the ease with which rewards come your way. You can be sauntering through a village when you notice there is a huge mountain in front of you. You are walking through a dark forest, beginning to tire, pining for a cup of coffee when suddenly teahouses appear.

For trekkers who seek solitude, a physically demanding trail, a sense of being cut off and not knowing what to expect around the next corner, Poon Hill might be a disappointment. In many ways, the trek is tailor-made for those who seek convenience above travails, company over isolation.
The shortness of the trek is perhaps its biggest selling point. Reasonably fit people can do it four to five days. In two days, you go from a smoggy city to standing in the crisp mountain air, watching the morning light gild mountains.
Thak Khola is on many a romantic’s travel list. But what was once a real isolated corner of Nepal now has a road connecting it with several hill towns. When the pressures of the outside world reduce in winter, it is possible to experience vestiges of that romanticism that was once characteristic of this region of trans-Himalayan trade and ancient culture.
You can fly into Jomsom, the town made famous in the song Jomsome Bazar Ma, then walk either upriver toward Kagbeni and Muktinath or go downriver toward the idyllic Marpha and other Thakali towns. If you can brave driving inches from a precipitous fall, take a bus or a jeep from Beni. But if you want to soak in the culture and immensity of the region, there is no better way than to trek.
Though Thak Khola sees thousands of trekkers and pilgrims each year, there are still places here that are off the beaten path, abandoned or simply forgotten. Trekking here in winter means you will not have crowds congregating in sites like ruins of old forts, centuries-old monasteries, sacred lakes tucked in the folds of mountains and abandoned villages. Thak Khola in winter is paradise for loiterers and seekers of solitude.
Bardia is Nepal’s wild west. The national park is the largest protected area in the Terai. It is perhaps the last place remaining in Nepal where people’s lives are affected by wildlife on a daily basis. Local hotel operators are dependent on wild animal sightings for business, and the villagers struggle to save their crops from ravenous elephant and deer herds.

There is a charm in being on edge, and that is almost a guarantee in Bardia. Go on a jungle walk in the winter months and the fear and excitement of the wilderness is heightened by the foggy weather. A crash in the bush can be anything—an elephant, a tiger, a rhino.
Even if the crashing sound turns out to be a docile spotted deer, your senses are pricked. That sudden flow of adrenaline is what makes Bardia special. But there is every chance that you will encounter wild creatures here: Bardia has over 30 species of mammals, 230 species of birds, and several reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile and the gharial.
Bardia is not only about primeval forests and wild beasts. It is home to the Tharus, the indigenous inhabitants of the Terai. Theirs is an incredibly rich culture, something of a cross between Zen and living off the land. A glimpse into their adobe and wood huts reveals the secret to their ability to live in this hostile environment. They fashion everything they need from the jungle, but they take only as much as they need. A Tharu village is in fact a reflection of the wilderness, a small part of a larger whole.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-destinations-to-visit-in-winter.html,travel
Nepal reports a further decline in foreign tourist arrival in 2021 due to Covid-19,"Monday, January 3, 2022","Kathmandu, January 3
The Covid-19 pandemic-hit Nepal has reported a further decline in the number of foreign tourists arriving in the country in 2021 from the data of 2020.
In 12 months of the past year that has recently been over, only 150,962 foreigners came to Nepal for travel, informs Nepal Tourism Board. This number is 80,000 less than the figure from the past year as 230,085 foreigners had visited Nepal that year.
As around 1.2 million foreign tourists had visited Nepal in 2019, the government had announced the ambitious Visit Nepal Year campaign for 2020 with a target of welcoming 2 million foreigners. However, the plan was called off due to the pandemic.
Whereas the arrival was on the rise in recent months along with more flexible travel rules, the fears of Omicron variant spread has affected the industry of late. The board data show the number was continuously on the rise from May to November, but it slightly dropped in December (from 26,135 to 24,679).
Meanwhile, India has covered the biggest share of foreign tourist arrival (64,673) in 2021, followed by the United States (22,853), the United Kingdom (8,680), China (6,196), and Bangladesh (5,044).",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-decline-foreign-tourist-2021.html,travel
Best of 2021: How Nepalis on K2 surprised the world,"Friday, December 31, 2021","Mingma G Sherpa, before he left for Pakistan to climb K2, the second-highest peak in the world, earlier this winter, wanted to prove a point. Having failed to reach the top last year, for Mingma G, this was all or nothing. He had spent a fortune of his own money and taken no clients. But, to put his name and the Nepali flag in the mountaineering record books, he was ready for anything.
K2 was the last great prize in mountaineering: the only 8000-metre peak unclimbed in the winter, hence the last great mountaineering adventure. Since the 1980s, K2 had seen only seven attempts in the winter, all ending in failure. Summiting it would book a place in mountaineering’s hall of fame. But, for Mingma G and his team, it was also a chance to show the world how capable Nepali climbers are when it comes to high-altitude mountaineering.
“The international media and the mountaineering community were calling us a weak team,” says Mingma G. “Only me and my team know how much effort we put into this expedition. There was no chance we were going to let anyone else beat us to the top.
Born in Rolwaling valley in Dolakha district, Mingma G’s journey in mountaineering started in 2006 when he helped his uncle at Manaslu as a ‘climbing Sherpa’. Having seen his father, grandfather and uncles climb to make a living, Mingma G knew that he would eventually get into the sport and on his first expedition, he reached as high as 7,300 metres. The next year, he reached the summit of Everest, after which he never looked back.
First, he was lured in by the brotherhood and fun in the mountain. Later, it was the money that kept him going as he became the first Nepali climber to make the most ascents of 8,000-metre peaks without using supplemental oxygen. But, he always yearned for more. Maybe that is why, he solo climbed Mount Chobutse, a 6686-metre mountain above his village in the Rolwaling valley in 2015.
“At one point, mountaineering becomes an obsession and you start looking for the edge,” he says. “Apart from that, I wanted to prove to the international climbing community that Nepali climbers are also technical when we have to be.”
That Chobutse summit got him a lot of attention, after which he started to dream about climbing in the winter.
By 2016, all but one of the 14 8,000-metre mountains had been climbed in the winter. The last that remained was the most difficult: the savage mountain K2.
“I wanted to do it for our mountaineering community. It was a shame that Nepal didn’t have a name as the first climbers in any of the 13 winter accents. The coming generation would ridicule us.”
He tried it in January 2020 with Iceland’s John Snorri, China’s Gao Li and Slovenian Tomaz Rotar. However, due to bad weather and poor health, he gave up his summit bid and came back.
This year, however, things were going to be different from the start. He was climbing with Nepali mountaineers Kili Pemba Sherpa and Dawa Tenzing Sherpa and without foreign clients. Joining him in the mountain was record breaker Nirmal Pujra (Nimsdai) and his team along with a commercial expedition from Seven Summit Treks. Nepal was running K2, and he would be getting all the help he could need there.
But, his expedition nearly hit a brick wall before even leaving Kathmandu. Both Kili Pemba and Dawa Tenzing were hesitant about going as were their wives who had heard about how people die on K2.
“Convincing their wives was hard. It took time and both Kili and Dawa, who are also parts of my expedition company, were in a dilemma about going. They were afraid that they’d lose jobs, but I was taking them because they are my best climbers. When they agreed, we rushed to Pakistan.”
The fear was justified. According to the recent history on K2, approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit. Even this year, five have perished on the savage mountain.
Having learnt a lot from last year, he even left for Pakistan early so he could make the best use of the good weather.
“We wanted to give it our best shot. So, we left Kathmandu on December 6, 2020, for Pakistan.”
After meeting Nepal’s ambassador to Pakistan and briefing him on what they were to do there, he along with his climbing buddies left for Skardu from where they began the long trek up the Baltoro and Godwin Austen Glaciers.
“It was so snowy, it took a week to get to the base camp. When we reached the base camp on December 18, the only team there were John Snorri, Ali Sadpara, and his son Sajid.”
The trio of Sherpas then spent a few days acclimatising and assessing the situation. As ropes were fixed till camp 1 (6,050) by Sadpara and Snorri, they waited until December 21 – the start of winter according to the astronomical calendar. On 21, they reached camp 1 and stayed the night there. It was cold, but all three were prepared for it. On 22, their plan was to fix ropes to camp 2 (6,700) and they did so effortlessly.
“Various media outlets internationally had written that reaching camp 2 would be our best achievement. Wanting to prove them wrong, we reached  camp 2 in just two days.”
Fixing ropes to camp 2, they returned to camp 1 where they spent the night battling the high wind. On 23, they went back up to camp 2 to deposit tents and ropes for the coming days and returned to the base camp to rest.
Mingma G says that the weather gods were very kind on him and his team. The weather cleared just as they started their trek to basecamp until the day they fixed ropes to camp 2. After 23, the weather started to deteriorate and they stayed at the base camp on December 24-26.
On 27-28, after the weather cleared, they spent the night at camp 1 and camp 2 respectively for acclimatisation, braving temperatures as low as -30 celsius. On 29, they headed to fix ropes to camp 3 but stopped just below the Black Pyramid and spent the night there.
“We fixed ropes to 7,000 metres just below the Black Pyramid. Our plan was to push for the summit on 30, but due to heavy loads and bitter cold, we gave up after walking for an hour. We realised that day that you move slower in the winter than you do in the summer.”
On 30, they planned to fix ropes to camp 3 (7,200 metres). As they were on the way to camp 3, they ran out of ropes that they had brought along. They radioed Chhang Dawa Sherpa, the expedition leader of Seven Summit Treks, and asked him to tell Nimsdai and his team to bring some ropes. They even used strong old ropes on the mountain as they made their way up.
Soon after the radio call to Chhang Dawa, Mingma Tenji Sherpa from Nimsdai’s team came up and helped as they fixed ropes to camp 3. After fixing ropes to around 7,300 metres, where the team left oxygen, oxygen regulators and ropes, they decided to call it a day and come back to the camp they had set up at 7,000 m and called it a night.
On the way back, Mingma G met Nimsdai for the first time.
“All by himself, he was carrying 200 metres of ropes for the later part of the expedition. He did not complain that he was alone nor did he make a deal of it. That day, I had a lot of respect for him.”
At 7,000 metres, another problem plagued Mingma G as Kili Pemba started to show symptoms of high altitude sickness. With the oxygen saturation as low as 30, there was no option but to drop down to the base camp.
As they reached the base camp on 31, the weather started to get worse. That gave Kili Pemba and Mingma G some time to recover after a few brutal days on the mountain.
It also gave them the time to celebrate the arrival of the new year before heading back up the mountain. That was also the day that Mingma G and Nimsdai decided to climb as one team: Team Nepal.
“We had a lot to drink that day. We bonded over booze,” says Mingma G, laughing.
That day, Nimsdai even proposed starting the summit bid on January 2. But, with the team members tired and bad weather incoming, Minmga G convinced Nimsdai to wait for a better window.
“He was worried that the foreign climbers would acclimatise and follow us to the top. I was too. But, we were in no shape or form ready for the summit push and with bad weather looming, he agreed.”
That wait gave him and Nimsdai and the eight other climbers enough time to recover. The weather got horribly bad too during that time, creating doubt among the climbers.
Winds of up to 50 mph were recorded at the base camp from January 1 to 7. As the weather cleared, the Nepali team then started to plan when to move.
First, they had to go up to the high camps to check the state of equipment they had left for the summit push. Nimsdai’s team left for camp 2 on January 10 to ensure their equipment was okay. Sadly, the wind blew most of it away, including Nimsdai’s paragliding gear.
Mingma G, who had left it at around 7,300 metres was hopeful that his gear was safe, and gladly it was.
“We had dug a pit and put everything in it. It was a good decision. If we had lost that, our expedition was over.”
Losing the paragliding gear did not deter Nimsdai who continued to carry on. The next plan was to summit on the 15. Nimsdai’s team was to leave a day early while Mingma G’s team would join them at camp 2 before they pushed for the summit on 15.
But, the weather window kept changing and the summit day kept shifting.
By January 13, all 10 climbers had left the base camp and were a few hundred metres below camp 3. There, they started to get conflicting news about the weather. Nimsdai and Chhang Dawa’s weather report suggested they should not climb camp 3 on 14. But Mingma G’s weather report said otherwise.
“Ours, provided by Krishna Manandhar, showed clear weather above camp 3. I was worried that day because I knew if we didn’t move that day, our summit bid would be over as we didn’t know what conditions to expect beyond camp 3. Even the Russians didn’t have proper information beyond camp 3.”
On January 14, Mingma G woke up early as did Nimsdai. Both were on the radio about pushing towards camp 3 as the weather was good. They got nothing from Chhang Dawa from the base camp, and as the weather started to get better, they risked and pushed to camp 3 to fix ropes to camp 4.
That was the same day Snorri, Sadpara and his son were also on their way up. But, as their weather report said bad weather, they stayed at camp 2. When they tried to climb on, the winds stopped them from doing so.
“They had winds at camp 2, we had great weather at camp 3. It was like the mountain gods telling us to have K2 all to ourselves.”
But, the plan to summit on 15 took another hit as they had to fix ropes to camp 4 which was no easy task.
“In the summer, it takes you four hours to reach camp 4 from 3, but in the winter, we got lost. We encountered crevasse after crevasse, after which we decided to climb a near-vertical wall, through which we could reach camp 4. When we reached camp 4, it didn’t look like camp 4. It looked different.”
That he says was the most challenging day on the expedition. Climbing the vertical wall in hard snow, fixing ropes in freezing conditions certainly tested their metal. Mingma G for most parts of the day was leading the pitch and by the time he neared, camp 4 was knackered. Realising that, he asked someone else to do it and Mingma Tenji fixed the last 50 metres to camp 4.
“As we fixed ropes to camp 4. We were assured that K2 was ours. There was no way we would let it slip.”
After fixing the rope, he returned to camp 3, excited and anxious about the next day. Mingma G knew that the summit of K2, where he had stood before, was at a touching distance. Coming down, they had planned to start the summit push at around 11 pm on the 15th. But they only reached camp 3 at around 5: 30 pm and realised that they needed to rest for at least six hours before the big day.
“We were shattered. We had worked very hard. I had planned to climb without supplemental oxygen, but as I was knackered, I decided to not risk it and climb with it.”
The day was upon them: D-day. As they knew that the weather would be generally clear with mild wind, they started the summit push at around 2:45 am on 16. But soon, the cold started to get the best of it. Moving slowly, they continued to climb. Up to camp 3, they were fine. But, as they reached camp 4, which was like an open meadow of snow, the wind started to get them, testing their resolve.
“We were moving so slow. My feet were freezing. There was a time I thought about turning back. I even called Dawa Tenzing, but he didn’t respond. Had he responded, it would have been over; I’m glad he didn’t”
All 10 had decided beforehand that they would wait for one another 10 metres below the summit and walk to it, arm in arm, like brothers, singing the national anthem.
“It was a great gesture, was an extremely emotional moment for all of us. When we reached the summit, we were happy, ecstatic. But, more than that, we were relieved. We had done it. We had climbed K2 and completed the last great mountaineering adventure.”
At base camp, they got a hero’s welcome. In Pakistan, they were treated like royalties. The part did not end there. When they arrived in Nepal, they were treated like kings.
“This is bigger than the world cup,” said Nimsdai at an event.
He is right. This was. They did not just climb for themselves, they did this for Nepal and most important for all, their fellow climbers. All they have all wanted was recognition from the world. And, on January 16, 2021, the world took notice.
“I know it might sound cocky, but this does prove that we are the best high-altitude climbers in the world. People can say that we were lucky. But, that doesn’t hide that we have etched our name in the mountaineering hall of fame.

Nepal snowfall: 9 top travel destinations for snow-lovers this winter,"Wednesday, December 29, 2021","Travelling during the winter has its own charm. The skies are mostly clear, the sun’s warmth is comforting and if lucky, you might even see some snow. Snow is something that appeals to Nepal’s urban crowd. Their love is evident during the wintertime when most of them flood places like Chandragiri and Phulchoki in Kathmandu and Ghandruk and Sikles outside Pokhara.
Besides these usual places, where else can you see snow? Today, we bring you a list of places where you can go to watch the snow and make snowmen and snow angels.
A place that acts both as a tourist destination and a pilgrimage site, Pathibhara is located at an altitude of almost 3,800 metres and becomes clad in white during the winter. It is quite majestic as the temple located atop a hill offers some magnificent views of the mountains like Kanchenjunga. It is quite a journey to get there, but if you do not have time but have money, helicopter companies provide deals to get you to and back from Pathibhara.
If you have plenty of time, the Everest region should be your go-to destination. You do not have to go to the Everest base camp. You can just hike up to Tengboche to see snow and the snowy peaks that are barren during the autumn and spring seasons. The hike is easy and quite pleasant. While it does not snow as much down low, it does in areas like Namche, Kunde, Khumjung and Tengboche. The view of snow Khumbu from the Everest View Hotel in Syanboche will leave you wanting more.
A day’s drive from Kathmandu, Kalinchok offers a lot. With snowing, pilgrimage, a cable car ride and if lucky, a chance to ski in the valley’s slopes, Kalinchok should be a place on your bucket list if you want to travel to a place with snow this winter. The time to visit this little paradise if you want to see snow is during December and February. This time, you might also be lucky enough to walk through some rhododendron forests along with a view of the Himalayas.
Another place in Dolakha, on the border of Ramechhap, Sailung is ideal for people who want to experience snow. Closer than Kalinchok, Sailung offers an amazing view of the snowy peaks. With hills over 3000 metres, most of the district is blanketed in snow as soon as temperatures drop. The view from some places in the area is quite majestic when there is snowfall as one can see over 100 hills from the area. Definitely, a must-visit if you have not visited earlier. If you have time, you can do both Sailung and Kalinchok.
An underrated gem, Ama Yangri in Helambu is the place to be. A part of the Helambu circuit, the place is white with snow during the winters. The view, which is quite majestic, is secondary. Along with the Langtang range, you also see Panchpokhari from Ama Yangri. What makes it better is the view along the top. You will see yaks and yaks, and meadows covered in snow. A place to go if you have not already…
Bethanchok might be the closest place people from Kathmandu can enjoy snowfall. At an altitude of 3,00 metres, the place offers a unique view of not just the mountains to the north, but also of the endless hills. Even though there are places to stay, it is ideal that you camp in the place to get a holistic experience. The sunrise and sunset from the place are magical.
Snowfall in Daman is a common affair. Close to Kathmandu, this hill station is an ideal destination for people to go play with snow. Apart from that, the place offers a panoramic view of the greatest mountains of Nepal from Everest to Manaslu to the Annapurnas. Sunrise and sunset from the hill station are also quite magical. Given the place is just three hours drive from Kathmandu, the place can be your ideal place to visit this winter if you do not have time.
Sikles is the closest place that people from Pokhara can go to witness snow. Only four hours drive from Pokhara, the Gurung village is a fun place. The viewpoint from the village is full of snow during the winter as you can see Annapurna II and Annapurna IV along with Lamjung Himal. The people of Sikles are lovely and you are sure to have a wonderful time in the village.
While those mentioned above were ideal for people from Kathmandu and eastern Nepal, Poonhill is ideal for those from Pokhara and parts of western Nepal. It is one of the prettiest places to experience snow. Surrounded by mountains, Poonhil along with Ghorepani has to be on your bucket list if you have not been. It is best to go there during the spring, but for a different experience, travelling there during the winter might be quite an experience.

Mt Saipal in Nepal’s far-west awaits climbers,"Tuesday, December 28, 2021","Bajhang, December 28
Mt Saipal (7,031 metres) in Nepal’s far-west is still not conquered even after 70 years since humankind’s engagement with the Himalayan peaks.
Although a 37-member team of mountaineers had attempted to climb Mt Saipal four years back, it was not successful.
The tourism entrepreneurs had taken the initiation for the mountaineering expedition on Mt Saipal at that time, saying the mountaineers were concentrated on climbing the peaks in the eastern mountains only. Twenty climbers of three expedition teams had taken permission from the Department of Tourism to climb the peak during mid-October to mid-November.
Pechhumbe Sherpa, a mountaineering guide, says four Sherpas and two Spaniards who attempted to scale the peak gave up after reaching 5,500 metres.
“This mountain is a technically difficult mountain, so we had to abandon our expedition for a lack of preparation,” he says. Sherpa still believes Mt Saipal can be scaled if the climbers are capable and make adequate preparation.
According to him, although the Sherpa guides opened the climbing route to the summit by tying a 1,200-metre rope, the climbers including four Nepali women say they could not climb and the attempt became unsuccessful.
The guides believe the ascent on the peak would be possible if skilled mountaineers attempted alpine climbing or climbing without a rope.
Although more than 100 peaks have been identified in the far-west region of the country and opened for climbing, none has been climbed yet. Therefore, the tourism entrepreneurs have urged the department to extend cooperation for making the ascent of those peaks successful.
“The department should attract the mountaineers by constructing routes up to the base camp and other physical infrastructures and publicising these virgin peaks to promote mountaineering and activities in this part of the country,” says Bhojraj Bhatta, the base camp manager of the Mt Saipal Expedition.
Though the government had waived the royalty for mountaineering expedition in the western region for 20 years with a target of developing tourism of this region, it has not been climbed yet.
However, the department has started taking royalty for the past few years.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mt-saipal-nepal-awaits-climbers.html,travel
Govt announcement to give staff 10-day travel leave yet to be implemented,"Tuesday, December 28, 2021","Kathmandu, December 28
In the annual budget announcement for the current fiscal year 2021/22, the government announced it would give each of its employees a 10-day travel leave so that they can visit their favourite destination inside the country. With the provision, the government wanted to promote domestic tourism.
However, as the fiscal year’s first half is about to close, the provision has not been implemented.
Six months on, the government has even failed to approve a standard operating procedure to implement the announcement.
Tourism Secretary Maheshwar Neupane says the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has forwarded the operating procedure’s draft to the Ministry of Finance, but the Finance Ministry is yet to give its comments. He claims the operating procedure will come into effect once the Ministry of Finance approves it.
Meanwhile, a source in the Ministry of Finance says it is studying the document.
Tourism entrepreneurs, on the other hand, have been putting pressure on the government to implement the announcement as soon as possible.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/travel-leave-not-yet.html,travel
Nepal cyclist’s dream of pedalling along the Great Himalayan Trail first time in history,"Tuesday, December 28, 2021","For Mangal Lama, the Great Himalayan Trail has been nothing but an obsession. That is all that he thinks and dreams about, and it is also the very thing that keeps him awake at night. The 37-year-old plans to become the first to cycle the entire upper route of the trail, but he is yet to find sponsors or any support.
Despite that, he is adamant. There is a drive in his voice and a gleam of hope in his eyes which show that regardless of the funding, he is going to go live his dream and rip through the trail around the highest parts of the world.
“This has been on my mind for a few years now. No one has ever done it and I want to be the first,” says Lama.
Over the course of history, many have done the Great Himalayan Trail. Some have even bicycled the lower route of the trail. But, no one has done so along the trail’s higher route that goes up as high as 6,100 metres. That is what Lama wants to do and he wants to do it in a record-breaking fashion.
Lama has been in the cycling trade for the past 15 years and it has been a few years since he has been thinking about cycling along the Great Himalayan Trail.
Starting off from the bottom, Lama has toiled hard to get where he is in life. Born in Kakani, a few kilometres away from Kathmandu, he was fascinated by bicycles from an early age as he, along with his friends, would run behind tourists who came to his village as a part of their bicycle tours. But, never had he felt that he would one day be guiding tourists around the country.
“I wasn’t great at studies and was neither going to school nor working, so my elder brother found a job in Thamel at a bicycle shop. I’ve not looked back since.”
The start was not easy. He hardly earned enough and was mostly asked to clean the bikes that had been out. He loved these bikes and wanted to ride them. But, the owners of the shop were not keen on that and forbade him from doing so.
“I used to reach the shop early, go biking and come back before the owners arrived and cleaned the bike like it wasn’t used.”
Soon, he started to learn about mountain bike races and wanted to take part in them. His first was the Damauli – Bandipur race back at the end of 2006 when he stood third. This was with his training in a laid back manner. That gave him the drive to work harder because he knew that if he worked hard, he could do a lot better.
“I even bought a bike and started to train after that podium finish.”
In 2007, he went to Sikkim to race. He had quit his job and taken loans from his friends to go take part in the race. No one had given him a chance, but he defied all odds and won. That opened a lot of doors for him.
Following that, Lama took part in many races finishing on the podium on most of them, but he knew that racing alone would not be a sustainable career choice.
“Despite racing, I started guiding almost full time. This gave me the chance to travel to many areas with people from all across the globe and helped sustain me and my family.”
But, the past two years have not been kind to Lama. Work is scarce due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and now, he wants to use the time to do something he has been dreaming of for the past few years: cycling along the Great Himalayan Trail.
“I want to take this time to go explore and see if it is possible to bike along the Great Himalayan Trail. If I can do that, maybe a niche crowd will come to Nepal to do this specific route.”
If he manages to do it, he will be the first to do the Great Himalayan Trail on wheels and create a record. But, he is not after the record. This trail is his one true calling, something, he says, he needs to do. Maybe it is to prove to himself or to others that he has still got what it takes.
To prepare for this gruelling adventure that can take anything between two to three months, Lama is training himself both mentally and physically. Although he has not been out on the trails preparing for the trip as he is busy looking for sponsors, Lama goes to the gym and works on his physical fitness because he knows how challenging it is going to get through the Great Himalayan Trail.
He needs to get ready for the altitude as he will be mostly above 3,500 metres. Along with that, he will need to be able to battle the snow that is sure to fall at one point in his journey. And, lastly, he will also need to know how to read the map.
“I will need to be extra careful around the far western part of Nepal because I’ve been told that there are high chances of getting lost. This is why I’m planning to take some wilderness training and map reading training so that I can be prepared for the worst.”
Lama also wants to hit the trails as soon as possible so that he can best prepare for the many new downhills and uphills that he will need to take to conquer the Great Himalayan Trail. But, that is not what he is worried about now as the major part right now will be funding.
As of now, there has been little to no support from Nepal or abroad. The only people who have supported so far are Everest Outfit with its lightweight sleeping bags and jackets. But, to achieve what he wants, he needs more help.
He wants to document his travels along the Great Himalayan Trail in order to inspire a new age of mountain bikers in and away from Nepal. But, that will need funds. He is also talking to many cycle brands asking for support, but none have come forward so far.
“People in Nepal tell me how good this is, but no one has pledged to support me on this endeavour. It’s okay though because I’ll do this with or without their help.”
Even though there are a lot of businesses that will gain from his Great Himalayan Trail achievement, help is scarce and that is surprising to Lama. Having been on numerous tours, he knows how much of a challenge people are into when mountain biking like and this, the Great Himalayan Trail, is going to be the biggest challenge.
But, he wants to make the route commercial so people from all over the world come and enjoy it.
“My end goal is to conduct a race along the Great Himalayan Trail and invite all the racers out there. This race will be the longest, highest and hardest. But most importantly, this race will be fun.”

5 best motorbiking destinations in Nepal for adventure lovers,"Tuesday, December 28, 2021","Riding a motorbike is fun as it is both exhilarating and adrenaline-pumping. Going on long tours on a motorbike past winding roads is something that one can only experience in a place like Nepal. This country has it all for the bikers – from smooth blacktop roads passing through national parks to dusty off-road tracks up in the mountains. Motorbiking in Nepal is something every biker should experience as the country offers you several interesting motorbiking destinations.
But, choosing the right tour to go on can be tricky. Today, we bring you a list of motorbiking destinations – from intermediate to extreme – which you can opt for if you want to hop on a bike and ride on the wild highways of Nepal.
A road trip to Mustang is something everyone in Nepal dreams of. While getting there in a car is also quite fun, the motorbike trip to the forbidden kingdom is just another experience. The road from Beni to Jomsom is brutal and will test a rider’s patience and skills as it is mostly off-road. From Jomsom, the road does get a bit better until Muktinath, but from then on, it is all off-road as you ride past waterfalls and huge cliffs. The view is quite magical too in the rain shadow area from where you get to see mountains like Dhaulagiri, Tukche and Nilgiri. It is better to take an off-road bike, but any other bike will do too. Just make sure you call and find out how the roads are before you go as it is prone to landslides despite being one of the best motorbiking destinations.
Difficulty: Moderate
Getting to Rara on a bike is challenging, but this challenge makes it one of the best motorbiking destinations. This ride will take you into the wilderness and on roads that are raw and wild. The first part is quite easy, but the trail gets technical as you take the road north from Kohalpur. As the area sees a lot of lorries, the roads are treacherous, and if you are not used to riding on slippery roads, it is better to avoid this route that needs one to be extremely careful. It is guaranteed that you will be shattered by the time you get to Rara, but when you get there, all your tiredness will go away. While Nepalis do take all kinds of bikes, if you really want to enjoy the trip, take an off-road bike to this motorbiking destination.
Difficulty: Hard
Manang is the gateway to heaven. But, to get there, it is going to take a lot of mental strength as the road from Besi Sahar to Chame is beyond rideable, especially the section before Dharapani. The road is almost exclusively uphill upto Pisang, after which you will start seeing some flats here and there. The view though is just magical throughout the trip. As the trail gets up to Humde, you can zoom through up to upper Manang with the mighty Annapurna range to your left. Although the road ends at Khangsar, it is recommended you stop in upper Manang and enjoy a few days in one of the best motorbiking destinations in the country before you head back down to Besi Sahar.
PS: Make sure you stay at Tal.
Difficulty: Hard
Riding around eastern Nepal has its own charm with several motorbiking destinations. You are mostly driving within the clouds. Whether it is strolling around Ilam or getting high up to Pathibhara, you have a road for the need to all types of riders. The trip starts from winding through the picturesque BP Highway up to Bardibas from Kathmandu, after which the road gets a bit boring until you get to Itahari. After that, you have the choice to either go north to Dhankuta and Hile or east towards Ilam. The road to Dhankuta is similar to the winding roads of the BP Highway but only bigger. The road to Ilam is a fun ride too, but make sure that you rest as riding from Kathmandu to these areas can be tiring.
Difficulty: Easy
The longest highway in Nepal also offers some motorbiking destinations for hard-core tarmac lovers. Also known as the Mahendra Highway, the 1,000-kilometre stretch is the best way to travel all over Nepal. Even though going through the mid-hill highway is more fun, that road is currently under construction. Hence, the East-West Highway is a great alternative to experience Nepal from the east to the west. It passes through all provinces of Nepal except Karnali.
This might seem easy, but it is not as easy as you would think it is. The road is mostly single carriageway and full of lorries and busses with the odd wide roads in some sections. But, many love the challenge of riding through them as the sun sets magically towards the west. Even though it might not look long, it is ideal to take a couple of days and stop at best motorbiking destinations that you have never been to because who knows when you will get a chance again

"Kathmandu Guest House inaugurates its newest building, Karan Annex","Sunday, December 26, 2021","Kathmandu, December 26
Kathmandu Guest House (KGH), one of the oldest hotels in Kathmandu, on Sunday formally opened its newest wing, The Karna Annex.
KGH founder Karna Shakya and legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner jointly inaugurated the new wing. The duo had also laid the foundation stone of the new wing in 2018.
The new wing was conceived after the 2015 earthquake damaged KGH’s main building, which was 100 years old, according to the company. The new wing has 35 super deluxe rooms. It is also home to the Museum of Nepali Art.
“We’ve come a long way since we started out over 50 years ago… Not bad for someone who became a hotelier by accident,” said Shakya during the launch event.
He also thanked Messner for coming to Nepal to inaugurate the building.
“He’s part of our family so much so we have a room dedicated to him,” he said.
Messner also spoke fondly of his love for the KGH. He said it was his home away from home and one of the best places to live in Kathmandu.
“This place is home it has always been home. I’ll come and stay here for years to come,” said Messner.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kgh-karna-annex.html,travel
Katrin Hagen: Pursuits to continue father Toni Hagen’s legacy in Nepal,"Wednesday, December 22, 2021","A Swiss man came to Nepal in the 1950s and travelled all over Nepal. He achieved the dream (of travelling across the country) of today’s Nepali travel enthusiasts, who probably were not even born or did not know they had such a dream. The man–Toni Hagen–may not need a big introduction today, but there was a time when Nepal had not realised who he was or what he accomplished in Nepal.
Behind this shift is Toni Hagen talking about his work in the early 2000s, and the relentless efforts of his eldest daughter, Katrin Hagen, even today.
“A lot of my time now goes into collection and organisation of his journals, sketches, photos and videos he had of Nepal. And, we have received a lot of love, respect and adoration from Nepal and Nepali people,” shares Katrin Hagen in a recent interview with Onlinekhabar.
Katrin Hagen herself is involved in several activities in Nepal, directly continuing her father’s legacy here.
“My father loved the Himalayas. He would tell us he had promised himself once he became a geologist that he would go to the Himalayas and study there. And, that is what he did,” recalls Katrin.
“So, he came here and travelled so much; he loved the people here,” she adds.
To mark 50 years of Toni Hagen’s visit to Nepal, the Toni Hagen Foundation was set up in 2001. Katrin is the president of the Toni Hagen Foundation (Switzerland).
Katrin Hagen now remembers how she got to spend time with her father in his later years. “It was only some 10 years ago before he passed that we worked together.”
“Looking back at the photos and videos now makes me realise how passionate he was that he travelled from east to west of Nepal in such adversities, with only three airports and no health or luxurious amenities like today,” she says.
Katrin became a surgeon in 1975 in Switzerland, became an orthopaedic doctor with a specialisation in hand surgery in 1985. Her professional life kept her busy. “I got to know his work better only after he passed away. But, it is better than nothing.”
Her relentless efforts to organise and publish her father’s work has made people realise what they missed. “In exhibitions we do, people look at the photos of Kathmandu valley then and react surprised about how there were no houses back then. Many have seen the documentary Uhile ko Nepal’ also put together by the Toni Hagen Foundation in 2018 and they refer them to me while approaching. Many call or write to me and ask me if I have photos of this region or that for their work. And, I help them when I can as well.”
In her recent visit to Nepal, Katrin Hagen visited the soon-to-be made Toni Hagen Park in Hetaunda, Makawanpur, in the Sub-metropolitan’s initiative. “The park has been envisioned to be a park for the youth and the senior citizens, with a library and recreational activities. The park has been initiated by the local government there and has the full support of the Toni Hagen Foundation. We are talking about installations, research centres, art projects, his old photos and videos to be put up on display as well.”
Katrin Hagen spends a lot of time in Nepal. Even in her 70s, she travels frequently between Switzerland and Nepal and manages both her life in different parts of the world. “The work here keeps me busy and I visit Nepal sometimes twice a year to twice a month, depending on the work,” shares Katrin, who was here in Nepal for two weeks recently, the first time after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world.
But, her first visit to Nepal was when she was a toddler and even has a cameo in the father’s documentary. “The first true memory that I have from the time here was seeing a large black snake that crawled up the stairs in Ekantakuna (Lalitpur) and me getting scared. This was when the Swiss embassy was there,” she remembers, “The rest of the things I remember–watching the mountains and travelling along the hills of Kathmandu–have all been mixed and I think I remember them from the photos and videos of that time only. But I will never forget the snake.”
“It was the time, as my mother used to say, when we would go to the American embassy Christmas events just to get the chocolates as there were no chocolates here at that time.”
“When I grew older and heard my parents talk about Nepal,” Katrin Hagen remembers, “I used to envision a different Nepal. But, when I came here myself again, I like the country, the trekking [opportunities], and the mountains. In 1961. my father was still working here, so we came back and visited Pokhara, Muktinath and went trekking. But, the country, the urban and rural areas are so different from the photos now.”
She was also a traveller like her father and has travelled to many places in Nepal and went trekking as she started visiting Nepal regularly after 1975. But now, due to old age, she is unable to travel. As a doctor, she also has been active in organising health camps for people outside Kathmandu.
One complaint about Nepal that she has to share is the unplanned management of roads. “If you see the roads, some are built poorly; some are built but do not reach the village; some are left in the middle, so it is a hassle.” She adds, “Many doctors are discouraged to go to remote areas. The unmanaged urbanisation and the expensive college fees are not motivation either. So, the government should provide some fellowship or aids to them.”
But, there is something that surprises Katrin Hagen even today. “The people here are still the same, very frank and helpful. I also meet a lot of young people who want to do something for the country and change it for the better despite problems and corruption.”
Going further, Katrin Hagen wants to continue working for Nepali people, especially in remote areas. “The foundation has been supporting in organising health camps in Bajura, supporting spinal injury patients, burn violence survivors, children with cerebral palsy and disabled children,” she informs, “Organisationally, we are looking forward to expanding research centres here in Nepal.”
“When the foundation was established, he [Toni] said he wanted to work for multi-ethnic and indigenous groups. So we will continue that as well. And, we are also supporting the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) for the last three years and will continue that,” she adds.
But, her primary motive is to collect her father’s geology notes on Nepal as the stakeholders here want to publish them. “They are the cultural heritage of Nepal and my father was the only person who took such photos and documented areas like Everest, Solukhumbhu, Dolpo–from east to west–as he travelled all across Nepal.”
Katrin Hagen is also working is to uncover more photos of Nepal that her father had in store. “There are many photos in the collection, but I do not know where they are or from when. Unfortunately, I cannot ask him where this is or that. Yet, I am trying to piece every bit of information together to make it cohesive.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/toni-hagen-katrin-hagen-nepal.html,travel
How homestays can help locals fight poverty in rural Nepal,"Saturday, December 18, 2021","Homestays are a modern paradigm of rural tourism, basically originated to highlight rural areas’ typical features, unlike star hotels. It is a service of lodging and food in locals’ own houses or in a natural topography.
Sirubari of the Syangja district is considered to be the first settlement to launch a homestay facility for tourists. In other parts of the country also, the concept has offered a paradise for ornithologists, nature lovers and researchers of various disciplines. Homestays can offer tourists facilities that modern types of accommodation may not be able to provide. It triggers the concept of protection and preservation of natural as well as the socio-cultural environment.
There are more than 500 homestays in Nepal and most of them are run by the communities themselves although a few are run by private companies. In the context of Nepal, the concept of homestay has become a boon for rural life to earn name and fame. It provides the locals with an opportunity of living in the village at the same time earning foreign currency and mobilising that local resources. It lessens the cost of marketing and delivery of local products in cities. Hence, it can be a great tool to fight poverty in rural Nepal.
Recently, a study was done in Shree Antu of Ilam to assess the impact of homestays on rural tourism and it also shows how homestays can help locals fight poverty in the area.
Shree Antudanda Community Homestay is a famous homestay located in Shree Antu, wards 4 and 5 of the Suryodaya municipality in the Ilam district, a beautiful ecotourism destination in eastern Nepal. It has around 43 houses and 172 rooms. In total, 544 beds are available for the guests.
Its main attractions are the following:
This study found that tourists come to the homestay for the following purposes: holiday celebration and pleasure-seeking (60.5%), pilgrimage (15.6%), trekking and mountaineering (12.4%), and others(11.5%). The maximum length of the stay reached was 15 days. A tourist spent USD 65 on average during the study period.
The lofty Himalayas, craggy hills and beautiful plains in Nepal create a unique ambience to make the country a remarkable tourist destination in the world. The study shows that the present socio-cultural aspects of tourism have brought lots of prosperity to all types of people like skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled ones. Thanks to an increase in their income, there is easy access to schools, colleges and health institutions, which are essential to improve the standard of living. The money can also be used as capital to start other forms of entrepreneurship. The homestay operators should use locally made products.
As a whole, homestays seem very good for developing countries. But, certain things are needed to be sorted out. There should be good hospitality and accommodation to fit the pricing of the facilities. Likewise, there should be tourist guides. Training them in language skills might be helpful.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/homestays-help-poverty-in-rural-nepal.html,travel
Gelje Sherpa: Nepal’s young mountaineer is looking for help to create history,"Friday, December 17, 2021","The past few weeks have been hectic for Gelje Sherpa. Ever since he announced that he will be spending his winter, attempting to climb the sixth highest mountain in the world, Cho Oyu from the Nepal side, he has been running around, trying to manage funds for the project. But, help has not been coming and that is making him anxious every day.
“I’ve got a team full of experienced mountaineers, but if I don’t have the funds, it’s going to be hard,” says the 29-year-old.
If Gelje Sherpa does manage to get to the top of Cho Oyu this winter, he will only have one more mountain remaining, Broad Peak in Pakistan, to become the youngest to have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders. But for that, he needs help and he needs it fast as he aims to become another Nepali mountaineer to create history.
Like many Nepali mountaineers, Gelje Sherpa started his career in the lower ranks. He worked as a porter for a few years and that helped him land a job as an icefall doctor (people who fix ropes and ladders along the treacherous Khumbu icefall) on Everest. He worked there five years, risking his life every day for a better future for his children, but as time went by, he yearned for more.
“When I told people that I’m an icefall doctor, they usually asked me if I’d climbed Everest. But, in my five years working there, I never got the chance to climb.”
That is when Gelje Sherpa set his sights on climbing 8,000-metre peaks. He wanted to turn his passion into a profession. He got his first chance in the spring of 2017 when he was asked to go to Kanchenjunga with a team. Even though he did not summit, he got a good first-hand experience of what to expect from 8,000-metre mountains.
He was upset, but he was determined. In the autumn of 2017, he got his first 8,000-metre summit on Manaslu.
“I was so excited I didn’t want to come back. The view was great and since then, I knew that this is where I belonged.”
The following year, Gelje Sherpa also climbed Everest and in 2019 became a part of Nirmal Purja‘s team to climb eight 8,000-metre peaks. It was then when he started to dream about climbing all 14 because, by the end of that project, he only needed to climb four to beat his climbing partner Mingma David Sherpa who climbed all the 14 eight-thousanders before his 32nd birthday.
“Nimsdai gave me hope. If he could climb 14 mountains in less than a year, I could climb four in a year. If there hadn’t been Covid-19, maybe I would have been able to climb all of them when I was 27.”
But, things did not go as planned. Even though Geljie Sherpa reached the top of K2 in Pakistan during the first winter ascent of the mountain in January 2021, he did nothing in 2020.
This year (2021), he also climbed Kanchenjunga, but with China closing its mountains again, he has a big task in hand to climb Cho Oyu and then leave for Pakistan to climb Broad Peak.
Although Cho Oyu is one of the less technical 8,000-metre mountains, from Nepal, it is the exact opposite. The mountain is treacherous compared to China and is steep and has some extremely technical portions. To date, only 14 people have reached the summit of Cho Oyu from the Nepal side, with the last one in 2009. But, that is not daunting Gelje Sherpa, who knows if he tackles the mountain carefully and with respect, he can reach the top.
What also helps him is the first-ever ascent of this mountain from Nepal was during the winter of 1984, when the Polish team led by Andrzej Zawada became the first expedition to reach the summit. He will also be helped by the experiences he garnered from various winter expeditions. Before he climbed K2 with nine other Nepalis, he also went on winter expeditions on Everest and Pumori.
“I know what to expect. But, that doesn’t mean I’ll get carried away.”
Gelje Sherpa says it will be easier to climb this mountain in the winter as there will be fewer chances of avalanches due to the freezing temperatures. But, that will also mean ice-cold wind, which is going to be his main challenge.
“I’ve been trying to get down suits from Marmot so we can test them in the mountains. But, they are yet to give us the green light on that.”
Another challenge he faces is getting oxygen. He says that he will probably need at least five bottles of supplemental oxygen and that will only be possible if he gets enough funds.
Gelje Sherpa says he has been asking major expedition outfits from Nepal like Seven Summit Treks for help and many have said they will help however they can. On the other hand, he is also getting some odd offers.
“One expedition outfit told me they’ll support me, but I’ll have to work for them for a number of years. It’s quite disheartening when that happens.”
When asked if any help has come from Nepal Mountaineering Association or the Nepal government, he says no. The climber says he has no link and without that, he will never be able to get the support from the government he needs.
What is interesting is there is a talk of the NMA sending a team of climbers to Cho Oyu in autumn 2022 to look at the possibility of finding a commercial route. A tentative budget of over $200,000 is also being set aside, but none of that is going to Gelje Sherpa although his input would help them a lot.
“It would be great if I could get part of that budget, but I don’t expect it, which is why I’m willing to take personal loans from banks to fulfil my lifelong dream.”
To support Gelje Sherpa on this quest are experienced mountaineers like Lakpa Dendi Sherpa, Nima Dorji Sherpa, Tashi Sherpa and Tenzing Gyalje Sherpa, but he still wants to take a few more because he knows he will need all the help he can.
“More people will depend on the funding. But, five of us are confirmed so far.”
While foreign climbers with next to no climbing records get funds to go on a guided trip to climb mountains like Everest, for Gelje Sherpa, things are looking bleak. He has set up a GoFundMe page that collected around $4,200 but he says he needs at least $50,000.
Gelje Sherpa says his family is quite worried too. His wife often asks him why he wants to spend his own money to climb mountains.
“She doesn’t understand, but mountaineering to me is more than just a job. It’s become an obsession. I’ve set myself a goal and want to fulfil it.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gelje-sherpa-nepal-mountaineer.html,travel
6 detours around Everest every trekker should take,"Monday, December 13, 2021","The Everest base camp trek is a trek every trekker dreams of doing at one point in his life. But, as iconic as the base camp is, it is not that great as you do not even see Everest from the base of it. For sure, you do get to see a lot of tall mountains like Pumori and Nuptse from the base camp, but there are a lot of other places in the region that deserve a visit.
These detours not only offer great views but also show you the other side of the Everest region and get you away from the crowd.
As Thame in the Everest region is home to all the legendary mountaineers like Tenzing Norgay, Apa Sherpa and Kami Rita Sherpa, you have to visit this Sherpa village that sits beneath the Kongde Peak. Roughly six hours walk from Namche Bazar, the village shows tourists the real essence of Khumbu. The trail winds through the countryside that is nice and quiet almost any time of the year. The Thame Gompa is a must-visit landmark in the village along with Sandar Peak which offers some great panoramic views of the surrounding regions. If you are looking for an adventure, the trail from Thame deviates to the west to Tesi Lapcha pass (5,755 m) and onto the Rolwaling valley.
Kongde is one of the most underrated places in the Khumbu/Everest region. You can see almost all the mountains in the region from this small village at 4,200 m.
The trek to Kongde is not easy. There are two ways you can get there. The first option is from Jorsalle, and the second is from Thame. It is recommended that you take the route from Thame as it is more practical as you will be acclimatised by then. The highlight of Konde is the Farak Ri that will offer you a bird’s eye view of the Khumbu valley and a view of 8000m peaks like Everest, Lhotse Makalu and Cho Oyu. A further climb from Konde is a beautiful turquoise lake that you should not miss out on. If you have the funds, Konde also has a high-end lodge owned by the Yeti Group.
Despite there being a trail that leads to the EBC, people hardly go to Phortse which is another quiet Sherpa village on the trail. Like Thame, Phortse is also home to a lot of mountaineers. The trail from Namche to Phortse is quite nice and not strenuous at all. This is a recommended trail even if you are going to the EBC as it takes you away from the crowd. Once there, make sure you go to Luri Peak (5,200 m) which is quite a climb from the village. But, the view from there is simply breathtaking. But, getting there is a bit tough so it is recommended that you take a local along. Apart from that, Phortse is also home to the Khumbu Climbing Center that has a Jon Johnston Mountaineering Library which is a haven for those who are climbing nerds. The trail that goes to Pangboche from Phortse is also quite amazing as the narrow trail winds up and down with Tengboche and Thamserku to your right. Maybe, the best walking section of the Everest trek…
Ama Dablam base camp is another section that people hardly take. A walk from Tengboche, for a day or two, takes you to the base of the Matterhorn of the Himalayas. If you are up for it, get some tents and camp at the base with mountaineers who will be climbing this gem of a mountain. The trail to Ama Dablam goes through the conifer forest where you see different types of Himalayan birds. The initial part of the trek is quite a climb, but gradually, the trail leads you above the tree line to yak pastures and contour around the ridge lines of Kantega.
Chola-Tsho is a stunning alpine lake that sits beneath the Cholatse peak. Most trekkers who go to Gokyo via Cho-La must have seen it, but you have to get down to really enjoy this lake that is bigger than Gokyo Lake. The trail to Chola-Tsho is the same as the Cho-La, but you will have to take a downhill as soon as you see the lake from afar. As you will be all acclimatised by then, trust us, you will not be disappointed with the extra walking.
Gokyo is the crown jewel of the Everest region. Do not listen to anyone who thinks otherwise.
If you are planning to go to the Everest region, you have to go to Gokyo and enjoy this spectacular freshwater lake. The main lake, Gokyo-Cho is the main attraction but the other five lakes–Thonak Cho, Gyazumpa Cho, Tanjung Cho, Ngojumba Cho, and Kyajumba Cho–are also quite nice. If you are only going to Gokyo, make sure that you hike a bit up and see other lakes around. Locals say there are around 20 high-altitude lakes in the area along the Ngozumpa glacier, which is the largest glacier in Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/detours-everest-trekking.html,travel
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa: Breaking barriers to become Nepal’s first internationally recognised female mountain guide,"Sunday, December 12, 2021","When Dawa Yangzum Sherpa told her family that she wanted to become a mountaineer, everyone took it as a joke. Even though a lot of men in her village went on expeditions to Everest, for a woman to even think about doing that was far-fetched.
She was told to sit home, farming potatoes, collecting cow dung and helping her parents. “Life was so monotonous,” says Sherpa. “It felt like I was in a loop. I wanted to go out.”
Not wanting to be stuck in a loop, she left her village at the tender age of 13 and since then, there has been no looking back. Over the course of the past 17 years, she has made quite a name for herself. Dawa Yangzum Sherpa has achieved her lifelong dream of climbing Everest, guided international expeditions and became South Asia’s first internationally recognised female guide (IFMGA). In 2019, she also joined The North Face as an athlete and has been climbing with legends like Conrad Anker.
Now, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa wants to pave the way for the younger generation of female climbers, mostly those that are from remote areas, as she does not want them to go through the same problems that she faced when she was making her way up in the mountaineering scene.
“I’ll do whatever I can to help these girls,” she says.
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa was born in Na, a small village in the Rolwaling valley in Dolakha. When she was six, she moved to Kathmandu where she spent her early childhood with her uncle. But, by the time she was 10, due to unavoidable reasons, her family returned to Na.
She was quite inquisitive from an early age. Having lived in Kathmandu, the village life became primal to her. She wanted to run and play and travel, but surrounded by mountains on almost all sides, she had nowhere to go and was confined to household work.
“Growing up in Na, I started to hate the mountains. We had no running water or electricity. Life was just so boring. I wanted an adventure.”
Then, the adventure came calling in the form of a trekking group. The group was going to Khumbu via the Tashi Lapcha Pass and wanted porters. Dawa Yangzum Sherpa said she would do it and lied to her parents and went with the group.
As young as she was, she was really strong. The village life had trained her well. But, trekking in altitude in excess of 5,000 metres was not easy as she suffered from mild altitude sickness. But, she made it out of her village and earned money which bought her a ticket to Kathmandu.
In Kathmandu, she stayed with her cousins. She joined school too but soon left as it did not interest her. She had seen how trekking guides were respected, adored and set her mind at being one. But for that, she knew that she needed to improve her communication skills and for that, she joined English classes.
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa got her first break at 18 when she was assigned her first trekking group. They were French trekkers.
“It was great going back with the group. My friends called me a sardar (a leader). People were quite impressed with what I was able to do.”
But, she yearned for more. She started taking part in long-distance running on the trails. But, the prospects of trail running were quite low, after which she stopped and continued being a trekking guide.
“After a while, guiding started to get a bit boring and as I knew a lot of people who were into mountaineering, I started taking courses.”
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa first did courses offered by the Nepal Mountaineering Association in 2009. In 2010, she found out about the Khumbu Climbing Centre and underwent their ice and rock climbing training. There she caught the eye of the founder of the KCC and adventurer Conrad Anker. He asked her if she would be interested in climbing Everest with North Face and National Geographic team members. Having dreamt that as a child, she did not think twice and accepted the offer.
In the spring of 2012, Sherpa climbed with the team with ease. She received a good amount for her work too.
“I didn’t know who they were. To me, they were just paying clients who were paying me money to climb Everest. But, later I knew how great they were.”
While Everest was tough, it was not as daunting. Dawa Yangzum Sherpa had climbed a few training peaks and mountains like Ama Dablam. But, Everest gave her a different perspective. She was one of only a few Nepali women in the mountain. That drove her to be the best Nepali woman to climb and decided to start her journey to become a mountain guide.
“I was earning more money than my friends who were working as nurses. They would tell me to invest the money in gold or shares, but I decided to invest the money to be a better climber.”
After Everest, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa went to the US to work with rangers at Mount Rainier. There, she learnt about the IFMGA and why people were spending thousands of dollars to take the course.
“It was a no-brainer. My mind was fixed on taking the training.”
In 2013, she enrolled in the first part of the training. While she was taking the training, she continued to climb mountains. When she was not climbing, she was either training or guiding.
But in Langshisha Ri, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa made a mistake that broke her. She was giving her final exam of her aspirant course, which was a part of the IFMGA training. Everything was going well as she climbed the peak along with her client.
“I was nervous because if I passed that, it would mean I just needed to pass one more test to become the first Nepali woman to become an IFMGA guide.”
However, fate had a different plan. She failed her test by the barest of margins. She had left her ice axe on the summit of the peak, which meant the examiners docked a point.
“I was so angry. It was extremely frustrating.”
Disappointed, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa knew that she had to go back. But, before that, she had other plans – the savage mountain K2. Even though people had advised her not to go, she, along with Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita and Maya Sherpa, reached the top of K2 and became the first all-women team to reach the top of K2 in the summer of 2014.
Summiting K2 gave Dawa Yangzum Sherpa renewed energy to complete the IFMGA course so as to become the first internationally recognised female mountain guide in Nepal. In autumn, she completed the section that she had failed before. But, to complete the entire course, she still needed to take the 21-day final exam.
She spent most of 2015 in the US, switching jobs to pay her bills. She was as far away from climbing as she could be. But, the climber in her would not let her quit.
“I could have quit as most do. But, I still wanted to achieve so much.”
In 2015, she heard that an expedition agency in Seattle, Alpine Ascents International, wanted mountain guides, she applied for their tryouts. Even though there were times where she messed up, the company still gave her the job and she has been working with them ever since.
Yet, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa still had to complete her final leg of the IFMGA training. In 2017, she did that and created history.
“It was emotional. All the struggle and hard work had paid off.”
She has been guiding on mountains ever since. In 2019, she reached the top of Makalu, becoming the first Nepali woman to do so. The same year, she also joined The North Face as an athlete and has also been going on expeditions with the team.
“Life is good now. But, getting here hasn’t been easy.”
This spring, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa also climbed Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and Lhotse; among them, she climbed Annapurna without the use of supplemental oxygen. In autumn, she reached the true summit of Manaslu with Mingma G Sherpa, creating a speed record in the process. All of this was done with an injured anterior cruciate ligament that she hurt while skiing last year.
Now, Dawa Yangzum Sherpa wants to help girls who are not fortunate. Having had such a journey in the mountaineering scene, she wants to help girls that are interested in climbing. Recently, she took girls to Yalung Ri Peak in Rolwaling.
“I wanted to show these girls where I came from. I wanted to give them hope that if someone from such a small village could get here, so could they.”
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa says she has been working with underprivileged girls and wants to use the funds she gets from The North Face and other sponsors to help them.
“I was helped by a lot of people, now I want to give back.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/dawa-yangzum-sherpa.html,travel
7 best destinations for ecotourism in Nepal,"Sunday, December 12, 2021","Since most of the places in Nepal have started to get urbanised, natural resources have been replaced with houses and modern equipment. Now, people are starting to notice the scarcity of greenery and its importance. Many are trying to enjoy themselves in nature and again travel for the cause. This whole process can be referred to as ecotourism.
In ecotourism, people are encouraged to enjoy nature or a setting in its natural environment, responsibly without disturbing the natural ecosystem. Ecotourism assists the locals in earning opportunities while publicising their local culture to the tourists and encourages them to preserve the ancient culture, environment, and wildlife at the same time.
Here are seven places in Nepal that are best for ecotourism:
The capital city of the country, Kathmandu, and its adjacent districts–Lalitpur and Bhaktapur–are located in the hilly region. The valley of three districts is filled with hills full of forests, woods, rivers, waterfalls, and various cultural importance, providing a variety of destinations for ecotourism.
One can always begin/end their day with a mesmerising sunrise/sunset from Nagarkot with a panoramic view of Mt Everest and the Langtang range. You can visit Nagarkot by vehicle or hike up to the top of the hill where there is accommodation for people from every sector. Tourists are always welcomed in by the locals from the Tamang village, where one can learn about their lifestyle, cultures and traditions. Other activities such as jungle walks, mountain biking, and bird watching can also be done.
The Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park is another famous destination within the woods where one can check the beautiful waterfall located at Bishnudwar. Also, there is Jamacho on the top of Shivapuri Nagarjun hill where one can see the amazing scenery of the Kathmandu valley. Other hills of the Kathmandu valley are also popular destinations for tourists.
Chitwan is mainly known for its lust jungles which house the Chitwan National Park. As a jewel of Nepal, the park is loved by many people and has become a popular destination for vacations and relaxation. Every year, there are lots and lots of people entering Chitwan to explore the national park.
The locals or the hotel operators are always there to assist the tourists by arranging jeeps as the means of transportation during their jungle safari. Apart from this, Chitwan is an apt place for birdwatching and encountering endangered species.
If you are visiting, you can join the locals for elephant bathing or canoe in the Rapti river. The tourists are always welcomed by the native people (Tharu people) to enjoy their traditional dances, foods, and their culture.
Taplejung has the Kanchenjunga National Park and the world’s third-highest peak Mt Kanchenjunga. With the help of a local guide, tourists are easily able to have a glimpse of the beautiful mountain and explore the different species of rhododendron, the national flower, and the diverse wildlife within the boundaries of the national park.
Panchthar Siddha-Devi is a religious place in Taplejung that has a crystal clear lake, named Timbung Pokhari, that can be seen covered in ice during winter. And, a hike to the Pathibhara Devi temple at 3,794 metres, is done by a number of people hoping for spiritual fulfilment.
The Kaski district is said to be a package full of adventure and beautiful places in Nepal. One such place is Pokhara where one can enjoy boating in the Phewa lake that has Tal Barahi temple at its centre and other beautiful lakes such as Rupa and Begnas. Other attractions such as Mahendra cave and Bat cave are famously loved by the visitors and there is Gupateshwor cave that takes tourists directly below the world-famous Devi’s Fall.
The Ghorepani-Poon Hill trek, known as the easiest but beautiful trek, can be completed along with the Annapurna base camp trek, Mardi Himal trek, and many other trekking experiences can be achieved while overlooking the amazing Annapurna, Dhaulagiri ranges. Sarangkot and Ghandruk can be visited to see the beautiful sunrise along with an opportunity to know more about the local practice of people living there.
Solukhumbu is the only place on this earth that has 99 named mountains in a single place along with the world’s highest peak Mt Everest and other great mountains such as Mt Lhotse, Ama Dablam. So, it is obvious that one can enjoy the best scenery of Mt Everest, Mt Lhotse, Mt Nuptse, and many other mountains. Tourists can do so from Namche Bazaar itself. The whole district holds a great potential to be one of the best ecotourism destinations in Nepal.
It is also a great destination to learn about the lifestyle, culture, and tradition of the brave mountaineers, the Sherpa community. One can also visit the beautiful Khumbu glaciers, the Gokyo lake, and enjoy nature while hiking to Kalapathar, Pike Peak. Lastly, there is Thukla Pass, a memorial made for mountaineers who climbed Mt Everest.
One of the two so-called deserts of Nepal, Mustang is a renowned tourist destination and among the best ecotourism destinations in Nepal. Mustang is a mystery in itself, the upper part of Mustang lies the ancient kingdom, which is also known as the land of Lo. Trekking from Jomsom to the Muktinath temple and going directly to Muktinath on the vehicles are some of the ways that tourists use to visit Muktinath.
The people who reach Mustang can enjoy horse rides, or travel the whole area on vehicles. It has proper food and lodging. Muktinath is a temple with 108 water taps where many people tend to take a cold bath. One can also visit other religious sites such as Marpha Monastery, Ghar Gompa and have a calm walk near the Kaligandaki river overlooking the beautiful Dhaulagiri range. Also, the eastern part of Mustang has the world’s best-preserved Tibetan Buddhism cave art.
Ilam is referred to as the tea garden of Nepal and caters for the whole nation with its delicious tea. In Ilam, wherever you go, there is greenery, it is a part of the beautiful nature. Because it is so closely connected to nature, Ilam stands as one of the best ecotourism destinations in Nepal.
During the visit to Ilam, people are allowed to get close to the tea garden, study them or wear traditional dress and create memories in the tea garden. For study and research, it is a great place to discover more about the unique plant and wildlife of Nepal. Lastly with the great support/ accommodation from the local people, an amazing scenic drive is made possible that pleases the eye of the viewer.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/best-ecotourism-destinations-in-nepal.html,travel
8 developments you can expect in Nepal tourism in the next 7 months,"Saturday, December 11, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic broke the back of Nepal’s tourism industry. Even though there are people coming in, they are in low numbers. Consequently, people who have spent millions of rupees in the industry fear they will never be able to recover the amount they lost to the pandemic.
Amid this situation, Nepal Tourism Board aims to create a space for recovery. The board estimate that Nepal will see around 200,000 tourists by the end of the current fiscal year (mid-July, 2022). To serve them, it has announced a budget of Rs 920 million.
Here, we present to you the major highlights of the budget plan of the country’s top tourism development body.
According to the NTB, around Rs 140 million will be spent on promoting Nepal’s tourism market. This includes taking part in international travel marts that take place across the globe.
A further Rs 40 million has been set aside for promotion, mostly through digital marketing. The fund will also be used by tourism board officials for emergency travel.
For the proposed research of an online market system, Rs 20 million has been set aside while Rs 15 million will be used for the development of information centres in different provinces.
As always, the board will take part in almost all the important travel marts that it has been taking part in, like the travel marts in Berlin and London.
The board also wants to promote Nepal by mobilising the country’s diplomatic missions abroad, and non-resident Nepalis spread around the world. It also wants to collaborate with airlines that fly to Nepal.
The NTB says it will also go to India and China to promote Nepal as a tourist destination and partner with the private sector to sell packages to the citizens of these two countries.
For heritage conservation, the board will spend around Rs 73 million. The money will also be used to hold fairs and festivals and improve regions that need improving for the long term.
The NTB’s Pokhara office has been allotted Rs 45 million, which it will spend on the development and promotion of heritage areas. Along with that, the NTB’s Pokhara office has said it will also use the funds to train people as well.
The NTB has also set aside Rs 180 million on improving the working standards of its staff. The funds will also be used on office operations.
The NTB has planned to start a recovery campaign to lift the tourism industry. The first initiative is changing the face of some tourist areas that are not yet recognised by creating a brand around them. The first place that this will happen so is Tokha of Kathmandu.
The NTB then wants to promote villages in Myagdi, Parbat, Baglung, Gulmi, Syangja, Tanahun, Kaski, Gorkha, Dhading, Arghakanchi, Nuwakot and Kavre as places for agro tourism.
There have also been talks of promoting the Chure region as a place for geo-tourism and the border between Nepal and India for religious tourism.
The NTB has decided that it will host travel marts across all provinces especially in Province 2 and Province 1. Talks are also underway to promote Province 1 as the hub of health tourism. The NTB has also been looking at promoting Sudurpaschim province as a farm-stay destination.
After all the years, the board has finally decided to honour people and organisations involved in mountain tourism. These people will be awarded medals and cash prizes for the work they have done in the mountaineering sector.
The NTB also says it will also honour the people who bring the most number of tourists to Nepal.
The board is looking at rediscovering the hippy trail around the Kathmandu valley. The board believes this will be a good pull factor for tourists who came to Nepal in the 70s and 80s.
A budget is also being set aside for the research of the benefits of hot springs.
Not having a tourist bus station in Kathmandu has been a problem for a while. While the roads in Jamal acted as a bus station for years, now, all the tourist busses can be found in Sorhakhutte.
After multiple complaints, the board is also looking at constructing a bus station in Kathmandu. A budget has already been set aside for this.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/developments-in-nepal-tourism-sector.html,travel

9 honeymoon destinations within Nepal–besides Pokhara and Chitwan–for the newlyweds,"Sunday, December 5, 2021","The Nepali month of Mangsir (mid-November to mid-December) is also called the month of marriage. Many couples who get married go on a honeymoon. The honeymoon period is a great opportunity for newlyweds to get to know each other better. Lately, going on a honeymoon has become a must for newlyweds. While some have started going to different places abroad for their honeymoon, besides usual places such as Pokhara and Chitwan, there are new destinations within Nepal being identified as ideal honeymoon destinations.
If you are newlyweds or soon to be married, where would you want to go for your honeymoon? If you are clueless, here are some fascinating honeymoon destinations you can consider:
From the Nepalgunj Airport, also known as the gateway to western Nepal, you can fly directly to Mugu’s Talcha Airport. After a  three-hour walk from Talcha, you reach the shore of Rara lake. Or, you can take a public bus from Surkhet to Gamgadhi, the district headquarters of Mugu. Then, in a two-hour journey, you can reach Rara, the paradise on earth.
As there can be up to one metre of snow in the winter, the temperature here drops below zero. So most people do not reach here for travel purposes. But, couples go to Rara to celebrate their honeymoon, and you can shortlist this as one of your honeymoon destinations.
Bardiya National Park can also be an attractive honeymoon destination for newlyweds. Located in the Bardiya district, this place is in a very accessible area as it is in close proximity to the East-West Highway. Attractive facilities are available in some of the hotels opened within the national park. Chisapani of Kailali, which is a short distance from Bardiya National Park, and various destinations within the park are also among the attractive destinations to visit.
Bandipur is another attractive destination for newlyweds to celebrate their honeymoon in cold and loving weather. From here, the couples can enjoy the view of mountains like Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, Dhaulagiri and other mountain ranges.
Bandipur is both culture-rick and tourist-friendly with houses built in the Bhaktapur style. With attractive destinations like Thanimai, Tindhara, Raniwan, Ramkot, Sunkhari, Khaddevi temple, Vindhyavasini temple, Mahalakshmi temple and an information centre, Bandipur has become a prime centre for tourists. There are about eight dozen hotels in Bandipur, so accommodation for the newlyweds is not a problem.
Mustang is not the choice of many in the winter season. However, Jomsom is also one of the attractive honeymoon destinations for those who want to start their wedding celebration in the cold. Nowadays, because snow covers the land up to Jomsom, people’s lives have been a little difficult. But in terms of happiness, there is unsurmountable peace that the new couples can experience here.
The centre of Gharapzhong rural municipality is about two kilometres southwest of Jomsom Bazaar. Here is a beautiful Thini village with the gift of unique nature, Dhumba Lake, situated about one km west of the village. During the winter, up to two feet of snow piles over the lake and the frozen snow changes colour. In the winter, this is a popular destination as tourists enjoy walking on the frozen lake.
Chitlang that lies in the Makawanpur district near Kathmandu is also an excellent honeymoon destination for newlyweds. Located at a distance of 27 kilometres away from Kathmandu, this place is also famous for its homestay and various local food. The place is ideal for day-long scenic views in a quiet and cool environment. Couples can enjoy village tours to see the destination rich in historical and cultural significance.
Here, you can enjoy peanut wine and wine produced in the village. Chitlang is also the perfect destination to taste local fish items and organically grown crops and vegetables from the home garden.
Kalinchok in the Dolakha district is considered an attractive destination, for travel or honeymoon, or for scenic views along with religious pilgrimage. This place is also one of the suitable honeymoon destinations for newlyweds. This place gets heavy snowfall in January/ February. Many tourists come to this place from Kathmandu and nearby cities to play snow in winter.
An attractive mountain range can be seen from this place where there is a temple of Kalinchok Bhagawati. This place is an hour-long trek from Kuri Bazaar. Located at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level, Kalinchok Bhagawati is believed to be one of the seven sisters including Shobha Bhagawati of Kathmandu and Palanchok Bhagawati of Kavre.
Janakpurdham, Province 2 capital, can also be a good honeymoon destination for the newlyweds. Janakpurdham is mainly known as a religious city.
However, the couples can spend their honeymoon time quietly and also visit the Janaki temple and the attractive lakes. Janakpur is also called the city of temples and lakes.
Dharan and Bhedetar can be attractive honeymoon destinations to experience both the serene atmosphere of the hills and the hot summer of the Terai. Located 16 km north of Dharan, the main feature of Bhedetar is to experience the sun and clouds playing hide and seek.
Bhedetar, located at an altitude of 1,420 metres, has an evergreen climate. It is a major tourist destination for people from eastern Terai and the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as well as a popularly growing attraction for others.
Ilam is one of the main attractive tourist and honeymoon destinations of Nepal. Kanyam in the Ilam district is a must-see destination for newlyweds. About 40 km north of Birtamode on the Mechi Highway, this place is covered with fog and the weather changes from time to time, so it keeps one entertained. There are good hotels and restaurants, enough to cater to the couples during their stay.
Since it is winter, the first thing to note is you should take warm clothes with you wherever you go for your honeymoon. Due to the increasing cold and the possibility of snowfall in the high mountain areas, it is advisable to carry the items to keep yourself warm. Also, carrying a lot of jewellery and money while travelling can be risky as well as a burden. There is no need to carry a lot of cash nowadays as the digital payment facility is now available in many tourist areas.
Apart from this, before going to any destination, you should get general information about the place, people, weather and culture. There is no problem with going on a honeymoon only after deciding on accommodation, food and other facilities as you like. Likewise, you should not forget to take your regular medication and the medicine for emergencies. As the medicines you need may not be available or expensive, it is a good idea to carry them yourself
After reaching any destination, staying in one place can be frustrating. So before you choose your destination, research and understand the surrounding area, note places to visit and plan out your trip rather than staying cooped up in the hotel rooms.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/honeymoon-destinations-nepal.html,travel
Bharat Bandhu Thapa’s new book: A perfect pictorial journey across Nepal,"Saturday, December 4, 2021","Photography and travelling have become Bharat Bandhu Thapa‘s life. Over the course of his career, Thapa has been to almost all of 77 districts in Nepal, capturing the beauty of the place, culture, flora and fauna and the people’s lifestyle in the districts.
“I love travelling and taking pictures, but what I really want to achieve through this is documentation of Nepal’s landscape and culture,” says Thapa.
In a bid to do that, he has released five books so far – Wild West Nepal, Gantabya Karnali, Karnali, Explore Farwest and Gantabya Madhyapur. In these books, he has documented the culture and heritage of the Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces showing prospective travellers what these two provinces offer. Now, Bharat Bandhu Thapa has released Tasbirma Nepal (Nepal in Pictures), a 320-page book that has documented all seven provinces, the major destinations in these provinces along its people and lifestyle.
“This has been a project that has been over two decades in the making,” adds Thapa.
He says he also wants to translate this book into English as he wants people from all over the world to know how much Nepal can offer to tourists.
“We think Nepal is just the mountains, but there is so much this country has to offer. That is what I want to promote through this book,” he says.
The book contains images that Bharat Bandhu Thapa has captured in his 25-year long career. While most of them have been captured during his numerous treks across the country, there are also photographs of some places so remote that he had to board a helicopter to get the desired shots he wanted.
The book has pictures shot before the devastating earthquake of 2015. The pictures of Basantapur before the earthquake are sure to make people nostalgic. He has also beautifully captured places like Helambu and Dolakha which are the Bagmati province’s best-kept secrets.
“These types of books are important because even people in Nepal don’t know how beautiful Nepal is,” says Ganga Prasad Uprety, the chancellor of Nepal Academi, the organisation that published the book.
Vice-Chancellor Jagaman Gurung also echoes Upreti and highlights the importance of showing the diverse culture seen in Nepal. “The book also shows people that Nepal is rich in culture along with its natural beauty. Documentations like these will go a long way at a time when everything is changing in the world,” he says.
The best section of the book is the one with pictures of the Karnali province where Bharat Bandhu Thapa has captured the grandeur of the Rara lake and along with villages of Humla very well.
“Karnali and Sudupaschim are two of my favourite places in Nepal. They are rich not only in natural beauty but also in culture and art. People should really go to these two provinces and see what real Nepal looks like,” says Thapa.
The book is available at Nepal Academy and all major bookstores and is priced at Rs 2,070.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bharat-bandhu-thapa-book-nepal-travel.html,travel
Mustang visit requires PCR report or vaccination card again,"Thursday, December 2, 2021","Mustang, December 2
A PCR report proving the visitor is not infected with the coronavirus or evidence of taking full-dose vaccines against Covid-19 has been made mandatory for persons entering the trans-Himalayan district, Mustang, in view of the new Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
The number of domestic and foreign visitors had been increasing of late in Mustang after the normalisation of the situation in the district with the second wave of coronavirus infection petering out. This had raised hope among the tourism entrepreneurs of the tourism business picking up. But, the news of detection of the new Omicron variant in several countries has dampened the hopes.
Chief District Officer Netra Prasad Sharma says the new measures have been taken and entry to Mustang has been made strict keeping in view the risk of the Omicron variant.
According to him, especially tourists have to show PCR negative report of seven days duration or immunisation card showing the person has taken full-dose vaccines or antigen test negative report in the last 72 hours.
Entry has been restricted if they cannot produce this evidence.
The District Covid-19 Management Committee says this decision, however, would not apply in the case of the permanent residents of the district and the employees, teachers and security personnel who have taken full dose vaccines.
The restriction has come into effect from Wednesday (December 1) and will last until midnight of December 15.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mustang-visit-tight-omicron.html,travel
7 trekking peaks in Nepal for beginners,"Tuesday, November 30, 2021","Climbing trekking peaks in Nepal is getting popular every year. While Nepal will definitely get people for the 8,000-ers, a large group of people come to climb the smaller peaks, popularly known as trekking peaks, in the country. Some climb these peaks for practice for larger mountains while some do it for the fun of it.
There are roughly 30 trekking peaks in Nepal with more being open every year. But, which one can a beginner do? Today, we bring you a list of seven trekking peaks ideal for beginners who have little to no mountaineering training.
Warning: Even to climb these trekking peaks, make sure that you choose a good guide and have ample training of climbing on some fixed ropes before you venture out into the mountains. Stay safe.
Despite being the highest trekking peak, Mera Peak is probably the easiest one out of all; it has no technical climbs. Yes, the altitude will be an issue, but the guides will give you basic training on how to use an ice axe and crampons so that you will be good to go. That said, the last part of the climb is quite steep so make sure you are fit enough because the view from the top is magical. Mountains like Cho Oyu, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu are so close that you want to get back to training and climb them one day.
Best time: Autumn but can be done in spring too
Duration: 15-20 days
Like Mera, Island Peak/Imja Tse is also quite popular among first-time mountaineers. But, this mountain is quite tough to climb as many have tried and failed to summit. Surrounded by mountains and glaciers, climbing this peak makes you worth your while. Back in the day, many climbed Island Peak before they ventured out towards Everest. Most parts of the climb are quite straight forward but there are parts that are quite technical so make sure you go climb it with a good guide.
Best time: Autumn
Duration: 21 days
A bit harder than Island and Mera, Lobuche in the Everest region is another gem. It is a bit more technical, which is ideal if you are getting into mountaineering. The steep climbs prepare you for almost all commercial mountains in Nepal. A lot of groups that come to climb Everest climb this for acclimatisation. Due to some steep technical sections, it is important you make sure your upper body strength is good. The view of the high snow peaks will be a treat to your eyes.
Best time: Autumn (lesser crowds) and spring (very crowded)
Duration: 14 days (can be more if weather is poor)
Pisang Peak is not really for amateurs, but with an experienced guide, the peak is quite doable. Located at a few days’ distance from the village of Pisang in the Manang district, you get quite an experience if you do manage to reach the summit from where you will get to see mountains like Annapurna Massif, Manaslu, Damodar, Tilicho Peak, and others. Make sure you choose a good guide and take some abseiling and belaying training as there are some rocky sections you need to tackle.
Best time: Autumn
Duration: 12-14 days
Kwangde is an impressive mountain. Southwest of Namche Bazar, the mountain stands out. Kwangde Ri is the collective name for the line of peaks running west to east that includes Nup, Kwangde Shar, Kwangde Lho and Nupla. All of them have their own difficulty level. The Kwangde Lho is probably the easiest out of all, but make sure you take the southern side. The view from the top is just magical.
Best time: Spring
Duration: 14 days (more if you want to climb more than one)
Chulu West is a part of the four Chulu peaks that overlook the Manang valley. This is one of the easier peaks as it is not technical but due to the risk of avalanches, it is tricky. According to mountain guides, the climb takes around three days, and the summit provides an outstanding view of the entire Annapurna range and Gangapurna.
Best time: Autumn
Duration: 21 days (Included the Thorong La)
It is another peak that is quite popular among novices. As its altitude is not that high, it has ideal for first-time mountaineers. As it is a non-technical peak, one does not require previous mountaineering experience but people who are not fit will not be able to climb this small Himalayan peak. The views you get from the top of the peak is just magical and make you come back to Nepal for more.
Best time: Spring
Duration:  10 days",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/trekking-peaks-in-nepal-for-beginners.html,travel
Why visiting Muktinath during snowy winter can be a rewarding affair,"Saturday, November 27, 2021","To visit Muktinath, a Hindu and Buddhist religious shrine in the Mustang district of western Nepal, autumn is considered the best season. The weather conditions during this season are perfect for walking around and sightseeing. I chose the same season for my trip in the past, but this time I wanted to experience something different.
I visited the trans-Himalayan district in December, the peak of the winter. The experience, however, was more rewarding as I saw the shrine snow-blanketed.
I had always wondered how snow-clad Muktinath would look like. I got the answer.
The tour began as December approached its end. My friend from Laprak, Gam Bahadur Gurung, and from Base Camp Trek, Sunil Shrestha fixed the date. I travelled as an interpreter as we were accompanying 12 journalists from France TV.
Muktinath needs no introduction. It is one of the most popular destinations, globally and locally. However, Jong, a nearby destination from Muktinath is not much heard of. We had planned to visit Jong this time.
We flew to Pokhara from Kathmandu and then hired a jeep to Jomsom. The next trip was up to Kagbeni on the jeep. The heavy snow meant we could not go further on the vehicle.
Therefore, we headed toward Jong on horses. The French team had come to film a documentary titled ‘Secret Path’.
The whole place was blanketed by snow. The Dhaulagiri Mountain looked astonishing from Jong village. The village is artistically and culturally rich. The gumbas around here are very old.

Sudip Gautam: Meet the man who rebranded Nepal’s popular Mardi trekking route,"Wednesday, November 24, 2021","In recent years, during the tourist season, one could consistently see a crowd of people in the lap of Mardi Himal. Between Dashain and Tihar every autumn, hundreds of Nepalis and an equal number of foreigners set out on the Mardi trekking route, ignoring the unpredictable weather. Every other day, some 200 to 500 tourists reach Mardi viewpoint and return after closely gazing at the mesmerising Annapurna range.
But if someone was to reach the spot a decade ago, the scene would have been very different. The surrounding was popular for the animal husbandry with sheep, buffaloes, buffaloes and yaks–brought from nearby villages including Siding and Ghalel–grazing everywhere.
The mountains look majestic from afar and it is fun to be close to them sometimes. But, it is difficult to live in the mountains. Locals were known to be practising a kind of shifting cultivation in which they would descend in winter and ascend in summer.
Entrepreneur Sudip Gautam is one of the pioneers who started catering to the tourists reaching the Mardi Himal trek and accommodating them in such difficult situations. He once dreamed of going to Switzerland to earn fortunes there. Today, he is working diligently to make the guests from Switzerland and other countries feel at home in the Mardi region.
Sudip Gautam was born and raised by his parents in the Machhapuchhre village of Kaski, the place with rich possibilities in tourism and the view of mountains greeting one since the morning.
Gautam was fascinated by fluent English-speaking tourists and then he got attracted by the charm of the foreigners who reached Kaski to see the same mountains. He was crazy about them so much that he would bunk the school and carry cold water and other beverages in a bucket and mingle with the tourists.
After completing his secondary education, he went to Pokhara, the provincial capital, to study further. He was dreaming of going to Switzerland to study hospitality management. But, he once happened to fail his exams and his dream was ruined. The guy who never even came second in any academic exams failed for the first time.
That failure changed the course of his life. When his dream to move to Switzerland failed, he started dreaming of a new one; to run a tea house, where his father runs a barn. Gautam then started knocking on the doors of tourism entrepreneurs and stakeholders to promote the Mardi trekking route.
Gautam’s life started being closely linked with tourism, but then he got the news that his failure was due to a technical error. Though Tribhuvan University corrected its results, he did not look back or “correct” the path he had embarked on in life. He continued to work hard and promote Mardi trekking.
Nowadays, the trekkers who reach Mardi are well accommodated with hotels where they can eat and spend the night. Routes have been made, stairs have been made to make walking easier, they have mineral water supply, and signboards, guiding them to their destination. But, it was not an easy journey in the past.
“The promotion started around the 1990s with the help of a foreign company named Himalayan Counter. When the tourists started coming, they met my father and advised us to sell beverages in baskets. That’s how our business started.”
According to Sudip Gautam, in the beginning, there was no house. So, they used to bury the goods inside a hole and retrieve them when tourists arrive. Meanwhile, they spent the night in a makeshift shelter. With the growing demand, the locals started adjusting the spaces for tents. But soon after the insurgency, Nepal’s tourism sector collapsed, and business took a hit.
With the success of the People’s Movement in 2006, Gautam took the initiative again and decided to open a tea house at the high camp. His thought behind this was that if the tourists find a place to stay, they at least do not have to carry tents with them, making it easier for them.
But, he was a young man, and he had no collateral to ask banks or financial institutions for loans. What he had was Rs 44,000 his father had sent from Malaysia.
Sudip Gautam says, “I took a loan from relatives and friends and build an eight-room house at the high camp at the cost of Rs 2.9 million.”
He encouraged his relatives to build houses at various places along the Mardi trekking route. Following his request, one of his uncles built a two-room house at the low camp, and another built a tea house at the forest camp.
However, the route was new and there were not enough tourists. There would always be a rush whenever they got the news that tourists were coming, unlike today where mules carry their goods. Gautam remembers, “My father and I used to carry heavy loads, and transport water, in a drum, from the bottom (of Siding).”
The locals used to be anxious when the guests did not come and scold Gautam. Tourists would only come for two seasons, and the rest of the time they had to lock and guard the hotels, with a heavy debt on their shoulders.
Gautam also doubted himself from time to time, tormented by the fear of having to go abroad like fathers. Regardless, he continued working and encouraged others to be patient. He would come to Kathmandu from Pokhara, carrying brochures, pamphlets and other materials for the promotion of the Mardi trekking route. He frequented the meetings and conventions of Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) and other tourism-related bodies.
And, his hard work bore fruit for the whole village in a multifaceted way. “Our vegetables have found a market and local products have been promoted. Locals also found employment and, gradually, the local economy began to thrive. Siding also changed its fate with new businesses, with cowsheds turning into hotels, buffalo milk being sold as coffee and tea, and plants turned into pickles.”
The Mardi Trek Tourism Management and Business Committee was registered at the District Administration Office, under Gautam’s leadership. After that, twice a year, the local entrepreneurs got their hands dirty and started cleaning as well as building the Mardi trekking route with 60 to 100 per cent of the money they earned from the business. They even received the local government’s support, says Gautam.
Though he remembers the days of struggle, Gautam smiles at the thought of being the person who established the identity of the place where he was born. And although he is appreciated more, he shares, he would like to share the credit with everyone working with him.
The Mardi trekking route is now a favourite to many domestic tourists as it was for foreign tourists until a few years ago. This ‘trend’ was not an overnight success. In Gautam’s experience, before the 2015 earthquake, only a few Nepalis returning from abroad used to go Mardi trekking. But, after the earthquake, the number of Nepali tourists increased rapidly in Mardi. For this, Gautam thanks social media activism. He says people also understood that one can go trekking at an expense that is not more than what one needs to stay in a hotel in Thamel of Kathmandu.
Nowadays, during the season, about 300 to 500 tourists reach the viewpoint daily. Every day, in the wee hours of the morning, people reach the view camp from the high camp and return happily from there.
This Mardi trekking route is also appropriate in terms of security as there is no fear of avalanches and landslides. It provides the trekkers with a 360-degree view of the mountains and all trekking trails leading up to Annapurna base camp, including Ghandruk-Ghorepani trek and Model trek, even the Pokhara valley.
Of late, up and down the mountainous slopes, Sudip Gautam has befriended books. His business is growing and stable but says it was his social responsibility. He still invests 10 per cent of his profits as his social responsibility. He has donated land to build a health post in Siding, where two health workers provide regular health care.
In solitude, he still reviews the past and imagines the future. The concrete development worries Gautam and says it will shorten all walking trails in Nepal, affecting the trekking routes and shortening the tourists’ stay and, hence, the tourism business. “The destruction in the name of development has to be stopped,” he says, “What would our situation be like without the mountains?”
Gautam has also not given up; he wants to make Mardi a sustainable tourist destination. He is now running a campaign to not cut down trees as well as exploring alternatives to firewood and gas. He is also conducting debates on policy shifts and wants to discuss what a guide should be like. Gautam says, “When you come to Mardi trekking, the guide should be able to tell you about the wildlife, flora, culture, traditions, ancient and historical facts found there.”
Other plans are also being drawn up. Sudip Gautam, who is now studying innovation and tourism, wants to link the experimental education of mountaineering to the Mardi trekking route. “There is the possibility on every hill in Nepal. Let’s promote product-based tourism rather than service-oriented ones,” shares Gautam.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sudip-gautam-mardi-trekking-nepal.html,travel
9 hidden gems in Nepal’s Sudurpaschim that should be on your next bucket list,"Tuesday, November 23, 2021","The Sudurpaschim province, the far-western region, is one of Nepal’s best-kept secrets. It is raw, untouched and extremely beautiful. This place has it all – from mountains to meadows, from wildlife to wilderness. It is a region that is so underrated that it hardly sees any tourists.
The place has mountains, lakes, temples, jungles and plains. In one province, you get to witness everything that Nepal has to offer. It is an area where time has stood still and if you are a foreigner or a Nepali who likes travelling to new places, this will show you the other side of Nepal that you do not get to see when travelling to Everest, Langtang or Annapurna regions.
Here are some places that you should go visit when you are in the region.
Let’s start from the plains. The Ghodaghodi lake is in the southern region of the Sudurpaschim province and is the largest lake in the province. The place is a gem for people who love solitude. It is also an ideal place for bird watching as it is home to around 140 bird species including the crested serpent eagle, grey-headed eagle, pochard and darter. Nearby, there are 13 other shallow lakes and ponds that create a unique landscape. Apart from birds, if lucky, you will get to see other wild animals too like the otter, gharial and the Bengal tiger.
West from the Ghodaghodi lake is the Shuklaphanta National Park, which is probably the largest grassland in the Sudurpaschim region. Home to the swamp deers, this national park is one of the prettiest national parks in the country. Like the lake, the national park also sees a lot of migratory birds and is also home to elephants, tigers and gharials.
Back in the 70s, the area was a hunting ground for the royals of Nepal, but things have changed as it is a protected zone now. The jungle and the park are not fully explored, which is why you find researchers and zoologists exploring. Apart from that, the place is also home to Rana Tharus, one of the earliest inhabitants of the Terai. So why not stay at their homestay and learn about their culture?
This is the heart and soul of the Sudurpaschaim province. This hilly plateau is the most popular place in the region. The air here is fresh and the terrain is lush green as if it were a carpet. There is a lot of flora and fauna in the Khaptad area as you will probably see musk deer, wild boar, and different birds like the chyakhura, kalij and danphe. A combination of green forest and meadows gives the place a calming atmosphere. Once there, be sure to go to the Khaptand lake and the Triveni Dham.
The best time to go is probably in the winter when there are white patches of snow in the green meadows that add additional beauty to the place.
Out of all the places in the Sudurpaschim province, this is arguably the most underrated area. Located in the Achham district, there are 12 lakes in the conservation area along with 18 meadows that give the place a unique landscape. From here, you also get views of mountains like Saipal and Api along with the Budhigankadi river basin. It is also home to tall cliffs that the locals climb to harvest honey.
There is something ancient about Badimalika. Maybe it is the landscape or maybe it is just the fact that it is a holy site, Badimalika is a must-visit place if you ever visit the Sudurpaschim Province. The scenery changes every season too. During the spring and monsoon, it is lush green while during the autumn, the green grass turns brown. In the winter, the place becomes even pretty with patches of snow all over the hills and meadows. There are a few lakes around too. The place is ideal for trekkers.
This is the crown jewel for trekkers as this is one of the prettiest conservation areas in Nepal. Api Nampa is the youngest conservation area in the country and may be due to that, it is one of the most preserved ones. As it is nestled in the northwest side of the country, it is untouched. The valley between Mount Api and Mount Nampa is one of the best parts of the conservation area as it is full of meadows, oak trees and coniferous forests. Animals like the snow leopard are quite common in the area too. You might also see the Byash community that still practices a nomadic lifestyle. The best time to get to this place in the Sudurpaschim province is autumn.
Mount Saipal in Sudurpaschim is quite popular among a niche group of climbers and trekkers. Getting to the Saipal base camp is not easy, but it is totally worth it. Walking on empty trails with a small group of people and sleeping on tents enjoying the night sky is what you should expect from this trek. It takes you past the Bhajhang district, past dense forests and a few local settlements. The best time to trek this region is between mid of October to the end of November, the festive months of Nepal, as the harvest has cleared fields to camp. The trek is quite challenging because it is less popular among tourists, is raw and unexplored. There are no facilities for lodging, and the trekkers have to be self-sufficient with tents and other logistics so do not venture out there alone.
Surma Sarovar is one of the hidden gems in the Sudurpaschim region. Located at an altitude of 4,300 metres, the trail to get there is not easy. You walk past high ridges that you get to by crossing passes and also get to walk past small lakes and ponds along with meadows with mountains like Jethi Bahurani. The lake is quite holy too as people consider it an option to the holy Mansarovar lake in Tibet.
An isolated lake in the middle of nowhere is another trek that is not for the faint-hearted. It takes around 13 days to complete. Walking steep cliffs and the base of hills of Sudurpaschim, this tough trek will test both your body and mind. Every year people get lost here so do not venture out alone and take a local along if you can. That way, you can enjoy the views that the place offers. The best time to go here is during Janai Purnima when a large group of pilgrims from the district go there. But, locals say that visiting the place during autumn is also good given you take a local along.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-sudurpaschim-destinations.html,travel
10 heritage sites of Nepal for outdoor photography,"Monday, November 22, 2021","Photography is fun and watching well-framed photos is even more fun. What more? When one chooses the perfect destination for photography, it sends chills down one’s body or leaves one in awe.
But, if you are not a professional photographer, you must be wondering where such destinations are to take your photos.
In Nepal itself, there are a handful of such destinations as the country offers you diverse topographical and geographical regions for outdoor photography. These destinations include erotic paradises, amazing landscapes, mountain views, temples, lakes, and many more. Also, Nepal has diverse destinations rich in cultural, ethnic as well as natural aspects.
Today, we will present you with a list of 10 heritage sites in the country that are best for outdoor photography.
Lying inside the Kathmandu valley, Kathmandu Durbar Square is a famous cultural photography hub among photographers for outdoor photography. It comprises temples and monuments like Taleju Bhawani, Kumari Ghar, Mahadev Parvati Temple, and Jagannath Temple, etc. To enhance your outdoor photography, keep any of these temples in the background to add cultural and aesthetic value to photos.
Also, it is good for street photography where you can snap the streets with portraits of local Newa culture and traditions. Thus, smaller details like pigeons surrounding the area, 4th-century foundations, temples, architecture, and cultures can be perfect for your outdoor shots. The Basantapur Dabali is another famous and common choice for you to explore.
Basantapur is a place in the Durbar Square area where feasts and jatras are often observed and one can snap amusing candid shots of the celebrations during Holi and other jatras. If you are lucky enough, you will also get to capture the image of the living goddess, Kumari.
Like Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square is also another destination to capture the local cultural traditions, temples, monuments, ancient water spouts, and many more. The streets of Patan are also famous for photography. Street photographers take pictures of the local street food, ancient water taps, sneak peeks of inside the temples, artworks along the streets, handicrafts, and portraits of local culture.
Similarly, there are many temples like Krishna Mandir, Taleju Bell, Tika Bhairav, and many more that give you the perfect background for your outdoor photography. Other elements that you can frame in the background of your photos can be crowded streets and the Durbar Square area, flying pigeons, ancient styled houses, ancient architecture taps and monuments.
The third Durbar Square of the Kathmandu valley that you cannot miss for outdoor photography is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The three Durbar Squares are equally accepted as the hub for street photography, vastly portraying the local Newa culture, and architecture in all its entirety.
The area in and around Bhaktapur Durbar Square also houses temples and places like Nyatapola Temple, Bhairavnath Temple, Siddha Pokhari etc. where you can strike a pose or capture the natural environment.
Bhaktapur is also surrounded by green hills and the scenic beauty around the place is mesmerising. Thus, outdoor photography in this ancient city is exciting and you can capture a variety of local ethnic Newa culture, narrow streets, handicrafts items, statues, ponds, hills surrounding the valley, etc to light up your photos.
Pashupatinath is considered one of the oldest Hindu temples. It is the sacred temple of the Hindus dedicated to Lord Shiva and is located on the bank of the Bagmati.
Though the main area of the Pashupatinath temple is restricted for photography, you can definitely capture the glorious temple in the background of your photos. Other than that, the area is full of elements you can capture including single-storey stone shiva linga temples, mischievous monkeys, the stairs, the riverbanks, the forest area and many more.
You can click photos of the Hindu pilgrims, sadhus, devotees performing rituals, and many more. One other thing you should not miss is the evening Pashupati arati.
Situated at an altitude of 1,406 metres, Swayambhu Stupa is atop a hill in the Kathmandu valley. This means from here, anyone can enjoy the stunning view of the valley. This also means you can capture the city in your photos.
It is a holy place for both the Hindu as well as Buddhist pilgrims. The lofty white dome and glittering golden spire of the main Swayambhunath stupa along with pigeons in the background make your photos glow. The sunset and sunrise from the viewpoint are also simply fascinating. In Swayambhu, you can take photographs of the portraits, fine monuments, statues, stairway to the temple, priests chanting prayers, photogenic monkeys, and the view of the entire valley from the top. Or place a subject in your photos and capture all of them in the background and make them aesthetically pleasing.
From here, you can also capture the beautiful valley with the sky and clouds looming on the horizon. You will have an exciting outdoor photography experience!
Kirtipur is an ancient city of Nepal and lies in the southwest part of the Kathmandu valley. When you go to Kirtipur, you find it a comparatively small area but the place has a lot to offer.
Like the Durbar Squares, this area is rich in Newa culture and traditions. Kirtipur is also a popular street photography destination. The beautiful Kirtiur is composed of Pagoda-style and Moughal-styled temples, monuments, suspension bridges, and numerous landscapes for your photos.

7 destinations you should visit to know Nepal’s diverse ethnic culture,"Saturday, November 20, 2021","Nepal is one of the best countries you can visit for your next holiday. It is a country of amazing individuals belonging to different castes from different ethnic groups, following different cultures and religions, and speaking different languages.
This makes the citizens and the nation unique in a beautiful way. Its identity is not just of being the land of the highest peak of the world, Mt Everest, but also the land with different natural, cultural, and historical resources. The ones who love nature enjoy Nepal, but the people who are interested in history also enjoy the historic values, monuments,  arts, and architecture of Nepal.Nepal is one of the oldest countries in South Asia containing various ethnic groups (i.e. people of the same attributes with similar ancestry, history, language, society) and its native people, where people live with the feeling of brotherhood, helping each other in need. If you are in Nepal, here are a few places you must visit for a culturally rich experience.
One of the most culturally rich destinations to visit in Nepal is Kathmandu. The valley is inhabited by the Newa community, because of which the city is rich with Newa culture. If you are visiting Nepal, Kathmandu–the capital city– is the must-visit destination for you as it gives you the perfect combination of culture, food, festivals, and landmarks that reflect the Newar culture.
The Newa population is one of the original, indigenous, & ethnic groups residing inside the Kathmandu Valley. They speak their language, Nepal Bhasa. They have more than 70 different subgroups occupying 4.99% population of Nepal according to the census of 2011.
In Kathmandu, some of the architecturally, culturally, and historically rich places you can visit are Kathmandu Durbar Square, Ason, Swayambhu, and Bouddha Stupa.
If you are in Kathmandu, you can try various local Newa food items such as yomari, chhoila, chatamari, aila and also enjoy some of the culturally-vibrant festivals like Gai Jatra, Indra Jatra, Ghode Jatra, Seto Machhindranath Jatra, Yomari Punhi, Swasthani, Kwati Purnima etc. Other places you can visit for a similar experience are Bhaktapur and Lalitpur.
Ghandruk is a beautiful village, an amazing place for trekking. From the village, you can get a magical view of Mt Annapurna, Mt Machapuchare, Mt Gangapurna, and Mt Hiuchuli. And, you can easily trek to Poon Hill from here.
The Gurung community is one of the indigenous and ethnic groups residing in Ghandruk.

Vinayak Jaya Malla: A non-Sherpa climber’s rise can be an inspiration for Nepal’s aspiring mountaineers,"Wednesday, November 17, 2021","Mountains have always fascinated Vinayak Jaya Malla. Growing up in Mallaj in Parbat district of western Nepal, he would often stare at Dhaulagiri, the seventh highest mountain in the world, and wonder what it would be like to stand on top of it. The mountain appealed to him like nothing in the world, but coming from a family that was not into mountaineering, he knew that climbing Dhaulagiri was a farfetched dream.
Fast-forward 30 years, things have changed for Malla. While he is yet to reach the summit of Dhaulagiri, through hard work and determination, he has climbed numerous mountains including Everest, Manaslu and Ama Dablam, and is one of few Nepalis certified as a mountain guide by the IFMGA. Initially, an outsider in Nepal’s mountaineering scene where 99 per cent of Nepal mountain guides are from the Sherpa community, Malla has defied all odds and done something only a few do.
Now, he wants to continue climbing and create a space for the younger generation of climbers as he wants to share what he has learnt in the past decade to aspiring and next generation of mountaineers along with creating a space for alpinism in Nepal.
“I knew nothing and had to spend a lot of time learning. I want to give back what I’ve learnt,” he says.
Vinayak Jaya Malla grew up in the village near Parbat and spent most of his free time helping his parents look after the farm and animals. The rest of the day he would spend with his friends, playing around the village, climbing trees and hiking looking for firewood and fodder for the cattle.
“Life was tough but simple,” he recalls.
He was as far away from the mountains as one could imagine. But things slowly changed when he moved to Kathmandu for his higher education.
“It was during the civil war. The Maoists had started to recruit young boys from our village to join them fight the war. My parents were afraid they’d take me and, hence, sent me to Kathmandu.”
In Kathmandu, he finished his intermediates and started pursuing a degree in business. It was then that he learned more about mountaineering as he had to prepare a report about tourism and mountaineering. During his research, he heard about trekking and mountaineering guides and learnt about their lives. That fascinated him.
“I was interning at an investment firm. I had to put on a neat shirt and go to work on a packed public bus,” Vinayak Jaya Malla remembers, “But, by this time, I’d already started climbing walls and hence didn’t last more than six months there.”
When he first climbed a wall, he started to get a feeling he belonged there. He was a natural. Climbing trees and hills in his village had prepared him for this. But, he had no idea about ropes and the ins and outs of climbing.
“I could easily climb the normal routes. Some, I had to practise a lot.”
By 2011, he started taking courses too. He knew he did not belong to an office. He wanted to be out and about. He started off as a trekking guide. On the other side, he kept practising rock climbing as he was hooked on it.
An adventurer at heart, Malla kept on pushing and started winning climbing competitions held at Pasang Lhamu Climbing Centre and Astrek Wall Climbing. He had also started to attend mountaineering training at the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). He knew that he wanted to climb mountains and being a trekking guide, and walking to the base of mountains made him sure that it was what he wanted to do.
Malla climbed his first peak around the same time. An avid traveller, he asked his employers if he could join a Japanese group that was climbing Scout Peak in Langtang. They agreed, and after that, there was no turning back for Malla.
“I had no gear or boots. I asked people to lend me their gear and rented some and reached the top of that peak.”
Other mountains soon “followed him” as he reached the top of Mera, Island and Lobuche as he continued taking advance training from the NMA. As he was doing that, he also heard about the IFMGA, an international umbrella for mountain guide associations from more than 20 countries. He enrolled in that organisation and started attending its mountaineering courses.
“This was different from the training provided by the NMA. It was more detailed and provided a lot more technical know-how. It took me a little over six years to complete that.”
By 2016, he was hooked on mountaineering. It was what made him feel alive. Going to places where the air was thin got him excited. Summiting mountains made him happy.
“Looking at other peaks from the summit of a mountain is something every outdoor lover should experience. It mustn’t be a big mountain; even small mountains have their charm.”
Malla stood first in his class of mountain guides at the IFMGA and that, he says, has helped a lot to get jobs because getting to climb mountains in Nepal if you are not from the Sherpa community is tough going. People do not believe you can climb and that doubt can get into you.
“After training, I wanted to climb 8,000-ers, but no one really believed that I could climb. Everyone felt what I could do on a mountain like Everest or Manaslu. They felt I didn’t belong there.”
But, that did not deter him. He carried on training and hoped he would get a chance. In 2017 spring, he got the chance to be an assistant guide on the world’s highest mountain. That was a great opportunity for him, a person not from the Sherpa community, to show expedition agencies that he belong there.
Climbing Everest was a big moment for him too. Everest is considered a benchmark. Whenever an aspiring mountain guide looks for a job, the first question people ask is if that person has climbed Everest.
When Malla stood on the summit of Everest, he felt he made it. “It was a feeling I can’t express.”
But, Everest also gave him a reality check. Walking past dead bodies, he soon realised that the consequences of climbing and that one mistake can lead to death. But, like these lifeless bodies, Malla had chosen to be there and he was as alive as he could be.
“It taught me to be extra careful.”
In the autumn of 2017, Malla reached the summit of his second 8000-metre peak, Manaslu, and since then, he has not looked back.
He has continued climbing peaks and guiding people to the summit mountain. He also completed his IFMGA training and topped it. When asked what his parents felt about him being a mountaineer, he says they were disappointed at first, but are gradually understanding his choices.
“Nepali parents typically want their children to work for the government or become a banker or a doctor, but I didn’t want to do anything like that. That disappointed them a bit, but they understood that this is what I was passionate about.”
Now, Malla also wants to try to do new things. Last winter, he and Tenji Sherpa tried climbing Manaslu in full alpine style. But, they had to cut their summit bid short because of poor weather.
“This project was dear to both of us but due to a lot of snow, we had to cut short our summit bid.”
Although he wants to do projects like these, the lack of sponsorships and support care causes problems for him. He says while it is easy for foreigners to get sponsorship deals, for Nepalis, that still seems very farfetched.
“Look how much Nimsdai had to do to get sponsorships.”
However, he is not disheartened. He says he will be concentrating on training aspiring and next generation of mountaineers as he wants them to learn about mountaineering. He is helping a lot of them too by providing gear and equipment as he does not want them to go through the same struggle he did.
He further wants to pave way for alpinism in Nepal as he believes there are so many mountains in Nepal that can attract people.
“For that, we need to do a lot of work and everyone needs to be on the same page. It won’t happen overnight and we need to change a lot of things.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/vinayak-jaya-malla.html,travel
7 best camping spots in and around Kathmandu,"Wednesday, November 17, 2021","Camping, if done right, is a magical experience. While you do not get the comfort of a hotel, camping offers you something different. Starry skies, campfires, and a bunch of close friends and family are all you need to make your trip memorable.
What is great about Kathmandu is there are so many places around the city where you can experience this. All you have to do is drive a few hours uphill and you reach a place where you can camp and have a memorable time looking at the rolling hills, the mountains, sunrises and sunsets.
Since the outskirts of Kathmandu valley are ideal for camping, we bring you a list of easy places for you to go camp and get an experience.
PS: If you want peace and quiet, make sure you get out before the groups come up to these places to hike or for a picnic.
For beginners, Hattiban is the perfect camping spot. It is close to the valley and has a lush pine forest. If you are a hiker, you can climb up the hill up to Champadevi hill and witness the grandeur of the mountains and Kathmandu valley. The camping spot is quite nice too. There might be other campers, but don’t worry, the hill has a lot of places where you can camp. If you are uncomfortable, you can go to the Hattiban Resort too.
To avoid tension with the locals, it is better you seek permission and pay a small fee before you enter the community forest. Locals around the area will help you out with firewood too.
Another place that is close by and has multiple camping spots is Shivapuri National Park. For beginners, Dandagaun is perfect as there are people in the area who can hook you up with wood, water and if inconvenient, a bed to sleep on.
But, for the adventurers, Tarebhir is the best place to camp as it is a lot more peaceful than Dandagaun that has a few hotels along the way. But, there is a downside too; you will have to carry everything from firewood to water in advance, to get there. But, don’t worry, you can drive up the hill with everything you need. The other downside about this place is that there will be a lot of hikers during the weekend so it is better to get there during the weekdays.
Kakani has its own unique charm. Another destination close to the Kathmandu valley, the place is untouched. The hamlets are extremely pretty and you get to witness the mountains along with rolling hills from there. The place is also ideal for stargazing. The best time to get there is during the spring when rhododendrons blossom. You can get firewood from houses around the village and it is better to seek permission if you are setting a camp next to them. If you are going to a hilltop, it is not necessary to seek permission, but there have been incidents where locals cause hassle so better to be safe than sorry.
This is place is just magical. The sunset from Lakuri Bhanjyang is too good to miss. Like Kakani, there are so many camping spots, but the best is the one close to Ganeshman Park. The night view of the Kathmandu valley is a remarkable sight. Getting there is easy as you can easily dive up to these spots on a motorbike or a car. Out of the places mentioned here, this might be the easiest and the best place to camp around Kathmandu.
Kavre is a dream for campers because there are so many places to camp there. The majority of the district has beautiful hamlets and hilltops that are ideal for camping. For beginners, the Patlekhet area is best as it is close to the main road. Balthali is also a nice place to set a camp. The hilltop above Balthali has a few spots but is quite a climb to get there. Bethanchok in the southern part of the district is probably the best place to camp. But, getting there is a challenge and it gets very windy during the evening, so carry as many warm clothes as you can.
There are so many places to camp around the Indrasarowar lake, in Marku. All you need to do is get on a boat and choose a spot. Ideal for all weathers, this place, even though a bit far, is probably the best for beginners. There are a few hotels in the area that offer camping services, but it is better you wander off on your own and find a place that best suits you. As there is water everywhere, all you will seek is some firewood which the locals will provide.
Khutumsang in Helambu is quite a ride away, but the views from there are breathtaking. Ideally, a weekend trip due to it being around five hours away, Khutumsang is known for its jaw-dropping sunrise and views of the valleys beyond. Located at an altitude of 2,500 metres, you will get an up-close view of the Himalayan range. The people there are lovely too so make sure you get there when you have a chance.
Things to carry before going camping:
All of these items can be rented from Thamel, Kathmandu.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/camping-spots-kathmandu.html,travel
Jiri: Travelling to ‘Nepal’s Switzerland’ in an unplanned yet fun way,"Tuesday, November 16, 2021","I used to feel everyone was travelling except me as my socials were inundated with travel photos. Even while listening to the travel diaries of my colleagues, I  used to feel like I was already lifeless.  At that moment, I wished I could add colours to my life via travelling.
My hands were already tied reacting and commenting on my friends’ travel photos on Facebook and Instagram. It was a festive time, a time to rejoice and travel for many who are usually bound by work commitments other times of the year. But, I also managed to visit Jiri, a beautiful town in the Dolakha district of central Nepal, recently, and it became a memorable experience.
On a usual Friday afternoon, a friend rang me on Messenger. I usually ignore such calls during office hours, but I happened to receive that call without thinking much. She asked me if I could join her to travel to Jiri.
“Yes,” I said with much excitement. But, in a second, I realised I needed to take permission. I asked her to give me some time.
Getting permission was a different story, which I choose not to discuss here. Whatever, both my family and workstation allowed me to join the trip.
I had a whole Saturday for packing and daydreaming about what Jiri would look like and what I would do there. To keep my trip free from any preconceived notion, I did not search for any information about the place that was on the internet. But, I had known the cliche that Jiri is “the Switzerland of Nepal”. That was all I knew about Jiri.
As I am a hoarder by nature, I packed a lot of stuff. Yet, I was suspicious if that trip would be any fun because I only had one person whom I had already known among a big group of people. But, little did I know that I would earn so many wonderful friends from the three-day trip and make so many memories.
As early as 6 in the morning, I left my house for the trip. At a decided meeting point in Shankhamul of Kathmandu, we all gathered and exchanged introductions and pleasantries.
At around 8, we divided ourselves into three groups (journalists, poets and photographers) and got into three vehicles, group-wise. The journalists’ group, which I was a part of, was women-only.
We were cracking jokes, teasing each other, singing ( actually, screaming) popular Nepali songs, dancing, and ‘enjoying’ the drive on the dusty and bumpy roads. Thanks to potholes, our heads frequently hit the roof of the vehicle.
Most parts of the roads were well-paved and the ride was smooth, but the road from Mude to Charikot was unbearable. What made the ride even worse for me was motion sickness. Yet, I was very actively participating with girls in fun, clicking photos and “screaming” the songs till we reached Dhulikhel for breakfast.
However, by the time we stopped for lunch at Kharidhunga, I had no energy left in me.
Before that, while I and my friend beside me were about to fall asleep, a loud and crazy lady (what I thought of her at that time) named Sajani threw water on our face. We two suddenly woke up. The water also entered my ear. Of course, it pissed me off, but I managed to not show that in front of the strangers.
Sajani neither allowed anyone to sleep nor to talk with one another. She made sure that all of us inside the vehicle were equally participating in fun activities collectively. She even did not let anyone receive calls and talk peacefully. She would go near the phone and sing a song in her loudest voice possible if people talked on the phone.
Nonetheless, Sajani ‘allowed’ me to rest for a while after lunch, considering my health status.
I experienced every emotion on the first day of the trip. As a Sufi music fan, I got annoyed with the taste of music or songs we were listening to. Still, I joined them happily. Sometimes, I felt left out, sometimes too involved and much more.
At around 5 in the evening, we crossed the Jiri Bridge and the cool breeze of Jiri presented us the warmest welcome. But, it was not anything like Switzerland that I had seen in Bollywood movies. At its first sight, Jiri Bazaar looked similar to any other bazaar in Nepal to me.
It was in the evening that I got to see the old photos of Jiri hanging on the walls of the hotel we stayed in. Now, they made sense why Jiri was/is called the Switzerland of Nepal.
But, the Jiri developed by the Swizz government was already shaken by the 2015 earthquakes and further disrupted by the construction of concrete buildings following that.
Leaving those human-made structures aside, Jiri, truly, was a naturally blessed place; I realised it on the second day as we did not visit much on the first day.
Yet, at around 8 pm, we went shopping in Jiri Bazaar. We walked past small shops with blocks of chhurpi hanging in front of them, and restaurants offering momos and thukpa. The Jiri Bazaar was alive and bright even in the night.
As a strict follower of the “early to bed, early to rise” formula, I went to sleep at around 9. Other colleagues were still chit-chatting and sharing their bittersweet experiences and stories.
I got up early, got ready and scanned Jiri from the balcony. The lush pine forests surrounding Jiri Bazaar were beautifully veiled by morning fog. The sunrise making its way through that fog was a treat to watch.
Lilaram Khadka, the coordinator of the whole trip, had asked us to get ready by 7 in the morning.  But, we got ready on as per our own Nepali time.
Khadka then briefed us about our travel plan for the day. It was the main day of the trip.
We started our day by visiting the Jireshwor temple. As planned, we walked for a while till the end of the bazaar and took our vehicle. The same vehicle, same women, but a lot more fun and laughter…
After a few minutes, we reached a gate that was five minutes away from the temple. From that point, we had to walk into the woods, accompanied by splashing small streams.
But, that five-minute path took us about 30 minutes as we were also busy, clicking photos and making videos for social media.
The temple was inside a cow’s udder-shaped tall stone cave and was filled with tridents of all sizes. Such a blissful place it was. I prayed there, put on tika and flowers and again got back to ‘the work’: photo session.
Meanwhile, Lila sir shared a legend about the temple. “A long time ago, a cow raised by a farmer here stopped giving milk. The anxious farmer went on to search why the cow was not giving milk. After reaching here (the cave),  the farmer found that the cow used to come there and give the milk to a stone. Hence, farmers started worshipping that stone as the Jireshwor temple.”
From the temple, Tara didi, Sajani and I decided to walk to the hotel. On the way, we knitted our bond much stronger. And I got my wonder friend, Sajani, the same lady who had pissed me off the day before becoming inseparable since that walk to the hotel.
For breakfast, we were served the local food including buckwheat roti, gundruk alu curry with some honey and cheese.  It was finger-lickingly yummy.
After breakfast, we visited a super-huge cow farm. The huge pasture land, once an airport, allured me; the cool strong breeze was hitting my face and making my hair fly. The river with crystal clear water flowing on the side of the pasture added to my excitement.
In one part of the land, a football match was going on. On the other side, cowherds were grazing cows, buffaloes, and goats on the very farm at a distance. And, we were in our own world, clicking photos and videos, posing, talking and teasing.
We then moved towards the cowshed, talked with cowherds, and caressed calves. Then, we left for a hotel for lunch. On our way, we rested for a while in the Tenzing Norgay Sherpa-Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial Park, the place where the duo rested on their journey to Mt Everest. We sat there for a while, took photos and headed for the hotel.
After having lunch, Sajani asked me to join her in a programme happening in Jiri Bazaar. I agreed. It was the finale of the regional volleyball competition. As soon as we reached there, four Newa children dressed up as Lakhe danced. Then followed some more cultural performances. Within a few minutes, I witnessed the cultural diversity of Jiri, at the same time their unity and harmony.
Then, we all left for Budhha Park located at an altitude of 2,384 meters, a 20 minutes drive from the hotel. But, our vehicle hit a glitch, we had to walk. But, the walk was so refreshing thanks to the nature and friends accompanying me. We literally laughed out loud, teasing each other.
Others listening to us wondered why we were laughing, some even asked us and later joined us. After walking for a while, I could see a huge Buddha stupa, calmly sitting on a huge pillar.
We then climbed the stairs between the flowers. As we reached the stupa, the sun was about to set and the view was just breathtaking. In a minute, the sun set and the fog started to cover all the surroundings.
We then walked downhill to the place where our vehicle, waiting to get repaired, was. Waiting for the repairs, we made a campfire, sang lok dohoris and danced.
By the time we returned hotel, it was already late evening. On the way, we also stopped for flying high on the traditional Nepali swing. As we were all hungry as a wolf, we indulged ourselves in dhindo and kalij pheasant curry and went straightway to bed.
We all gathered at around 7 the next day. Before leaving, all of us sat together and shared our feelings about Jiri. We then bought some koselis (souvenirs) and left for Kathmandu, capturing all the memories of Jiri in our hearts.
Just before we left, Lila Sir said this visit was just a trailer as we merely visited about 20 per cent of Jiri. This ignited my wish to come to Jiri again and further explore this wonderful place and make a visit to the places we missed this time.
Returning to Kathmandu, we passed the way with much enthusiasm and laughter as we did on the first day.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/jiri-nepal-switzerland-travel.html,travel
10 things every traveller should do in Nepal,"Saturday, November 13, 2021","Visiting Nepal is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When you are visiting another country for a vacation, you most probably will want to experience everything that the country has to offer. Nepal indeed has a lot of enticing experiences for you. From paragliding to climbing the tallest mountain in the world, there are lots of things in Nepal you might not want to miss during your trip.
Among that plethora of experiences, here are 10 things every traveller should do in Nepal for an ultimate Nepal-visiting experience:
You will most probably be entering Nepal through Kathmandu because the only international airport is located here. In such a case, going sightseeing around the Kathmandu valley might be the first thing you might want to do. This will also be the best thing to do on day 1 of your Nepal visit as you might be too exhausted to do something more adventurous.
Different parts of the valley are famous for various things. Starting from religious sites like Bouddhanath Stupa, Swayambhu Stupa and Pashupatinath Temple to tourist hubs like Thamel and Durbar Marg, you can explore the bests of Kathmandu. As for Lalitpur, Patan Durbar Square is the place to start. If you want to see the historical, cultural and religious side of the valley, another stop is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Other places to stop are Changu Narayan Temple, the oldest temple in Nepal, and Godavari Botanical Garden with different types of flora and fauna.
Any visit to Nepal will not be complete until and unless you come to Pokhara and engage in multitudes of adventurous activities this city has to offer. Pokhara is considered the hottest tourist destination in Nepal. There are many religious places you can visit including Tal Bahari Temple, Bindhyabasini, World Peace Stupa, etc. as well as many natural spots like Phewa Lake, Begnas and Rupa Lake along with Mahendra Cave, and Devi’s Falls.
For adventure lovers, Pokhara offers one of the best experiences for paragliding and ultralight flights. Zip flyer, skydiving and hand gliding are other great options in Pokhara. Or, relax and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Machhapuchhre and Mount Annapurna among others while air blows all around you. You can also choose to ride through various bike trails around the city and break some sweat. If you are feeling more adventurous, trekking to mountain peaks and their base camps is also an option.
Nepal is a country gifted with lots of water resources. The perennial rivers that come from many mountain ranges in Nepal are famous for rafting. Rivers like Bhote Koshi, Trishuli, Kali Gandaki, Sun Koshi are more popular. However, Bhote Khosi river is best for rafting and kayaking, and Trisuli river is best for canoeing due to its adventures. Another great water sport would be a stand-up paddle in Pokhara. This is the perfect thing to do if you ever visit Nepal and you are adventure enthusiasts.
Other than water sports, there are many things that you can do in Nepal in terms of adventure sports. Starting with the biking trails in Kathmandu, its lesser-known trails, hills and forests are perfect for biking enthusiasts. Mountain bikes are easily available in Kathmandu if you want to explore its exquisite landscape.
For the adrenaline rush, you can also go bungee jumping or canyon swing; Bhote Koshi Gorge and Hemja in Pokhara are the best places for sports respectively. You might also be interested in rock climbing at Nagarjun Forest Reserve as it is beginner-friendly and also good for professional ones. Also, you can always visit The village of Humde in the Annapurna region for ice climbing.
Nepal, though small, has many famous national parks with rich biodiversity in flora and fauna. Chitwan National Park is the oldest and one among the not-to-be-missed places you can visit during your Nepal visit. Wildlife safari is one of the most famous activities in the park, where you can get unforgettable experience to witness one-horned rhinoceros, royal Bengal tigers, ghariyals, peacocks, musk deers, kingfisher, brahminy duck and paradise flycatcher, etc. You can do this by riding on elephants or on jeeps. Animal rights activists have been discouraging elephant riding these days though.
Near the park, you can also visit the Elephant Breeding Centre to learn more about them, feed them, and help them be preserved as they are becoming one of the most endangered animals in the world. You can even go for an elephant bathing in Sauraha and get the opportunity for a dip and dive with the elephants. Not only that you can also enjoy ox and pony rides or go for boating along the Rapti river. The cultural stick-and-peacock dances are not to be missed.
Mountain climbing is also another option for you since Nepal is the home of eight of the highest mountains in the world. Nepal is famous for its astounding trekking routes of paradise. Annapurna and Everest are the two most popular trekking routes in Nepal. Everest trek starts from Lukla which can be reached by flight accompanied by the jaw-dropping view of Dudh Koshi valley. Likewise, the Annapurna hike offers you gorgeous mountains, hot springs and a delightful farming village.
If you do not want to choose an extreme peak like Mt Everest, you can always go for Kanchenjunga or Lhotse to enjoy the mountaineering experience. Yala Peak, Chulu West Peak, Pisang Peak and Island Peak are other few of the peaks that do not have much height but give you the thrill nevertheless.
If you are not into mountain climbing, but still want to enjoy the stunning view of Mount Everest, a helicopter flight might be perfect for you. This will not be as exciting as mountain climbing or trekking, but the view of the world’s tallest mountain will be a jaw-dropping sight. You will be soaring through the air over the Himalayan range up close, with the view of peaks like Gaurishankar, Cho-Oyu, Lhakpa Dorje and many others will be one of the best things you will do in your life.
In east Nepal, you can visit Ilam to feel the pleasant scent of tea leaves ever-present in the air. Ilam is one of the most beautiful tea gardens in the world. Also, the tea produced in this place is regarded as one of the best teas in Nepal. The weather in this place is also very mild and very favourable. One can calm down and enjoy some tea. While you are staying there, you can also taste some of the best Ilam teas and their varieties including Nepali spiced tea, Nilgiri tea or even organic Himalayan tea.
Lumbini is one of the most religiously and historically important sites in Nepal. Lumbini is the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and has many ancient temples. Maya Devi Temple here is regarded as the place where Gautam Buddha was born. Other than that, the major places to visit are Ashoka Pillar, Eternal Peace Flame, Holy Pond, etc.
Lumbini also has a multitude of monasteries and holds high importance in Buddhist rituals every year. Buddhist monks often sit under the tree meditating and chanting spiritual scripts. Not only that, but you can also visit amazing monasteries located here made by people from Germany, Nepal and China, Myanmar, and Vietnam. All have intricate architectural designs with high Buddhist influence.
If you are in Nepal, you must try Nepali cuisine, as it reflects the Nepali culture most tastefully. There are so many dishes available with their amazing blend and lip-smacking flavours. Staple foods like dal-bhat and dhindo are popular and healthy ones. These foods are best served with gundruk ko jhol (fermented leafy green pickles) or meat curry.
Other famous food includes Newari food items like samaybaji, chatamari, chhoila, etc. They all are a great option when it comes to cultural cuisines, and you cannot have enough.
If you are craving for local street foods, you can also try momo, chhoila, etc. or try some Indian snacks like pani-puri, chatpatay, and samosa, which are widely available in Nepal. You can always visit Bhaktapur for some authentic, delicious Juju Dhau (yoghurt) for some sweetness. You can also go for a food tour to eat different kinds of food items on your trip or go around to taste the same kind of food from different places. Both will be unforgettable experiences for you.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/things-traveller-should-do-in-nepal.html,travel
5 best MICE tourism destinations in Nepal,"Friday, November 12, 2021","Nepal has always been said to have untapped potential in the tourism sector. As a country of nature and culture, the tourism opportunities also revolve around the same, but there is one more section where Nepal can garner a substantial audience. That is MICE tourism.
MICE, here, simply stands for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions. It is business tourism at its best, focused on bringing together top experts from various industries in a more improved and catering to them with tailor-made hospitality services.
MICE is a wonderful blend of business and travel. Nepal has a competitive advantage and can build on a destination’s distinct characteristics, encouraging MICE tourism further. As this form of tourism base is closely related to the travel and hotel industries, Nepal’s tourism industry as a whole can benefit even more. It also aids any firm in expanding its client base while maintaining the current market.
Here are some places in Nepal that can be great destinations for MICE tourism providing you unique blends of prospects for enhancing your business with partners, possible investors, customers, and suppliers, as well as the sharing of innovative ideas.
When tourists come to Nepal, Chitwan is almost certainly on their list. Chitwan is surrounded by natural beauty and lush vegetation. But more than that, people are immediately drawn to the Chitwan National Park, which is also the biggest attraction in Chitwan. It is rather huge and offers the opportunity to see creatures such as rhinos and elephants, up-close with nature walks.
Chitwan has the potential to be a key player in Nepal’s MICE tourism industry. Participants can also enjoy jungle safaris while doing official work. The fact that Chitwan National Park is close to the Indian border is a perk in itself. It is relatively cool, in temperature, compared to Bhairawaha and Birgunj, therefore making it the best place to organise meetings, conferences, and exhibitions. MICE tourism in Chitwan is less expensive than in other tourist destinations, and it is also more conveniently accessible for participants.
Kathmandu is known to be the Shangrila city of Nepal. It is the first destination of any tourists while visiting Nepal. It is the cradle of Nepali civilisation and culture, made more beautiful with the view of the snowy peaks and mountains in the north. It is also the realm of kings, queens, princes, princesses, and living deities, all of whom are still revered today. Ancient temples, palaces, shrines, squares, and courtyards in the city makes it a living museum, and various parades, celebrations, and feasts give a richer experience.
Being the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu has a large number of conference halls to choose from, as stand-alone venues or in three to five-star hotels. With sophisticated audio, video, lighting, communications, catering, ventilation, and parking facilities, there are many state-of-the-art facilities for conferences and conventions, supporting and promoting MICE tourism.
Pokhara, like Kathmandu and Chitwan, is a popular MICE tourism destination. When it comes to tourism, Pokhara has a lot to offer already.
Pokhara is known as Nepal’s tourism capital. Many travel authors have written about its enthralling beauty. The tranquil Phewa, Begnas, and Rupa lakes, as well as the fresh air in the beautiful backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range, make this place ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’.
It is the beginning point for many treks and is home to wonderfully kind and fascinating people, helping the city to evolve into a tourist hub. Pokhara can cater to everyone’s needs, from business events to recreational activities. A variety of hotels and conference halls are available to accommodate different events of the corporate world for business and networking.
Lumbini is famous worldwide for being the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Lumbini, like Chitwan, is located close to the Nepal-India border. Because it is the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha, Lumbini is an excellent MICE tourism destination. It has a lot to offer in terms of religion as well as natural beauty.
Lord Buddha was born in Lumbini as Siddhartha Gautam in a famous garden that eventually became a pilgrimage site or one of the world’s most important sacred sites. The Indian monarch Ashoka was among the pilgrims, and one of his commemorative pillars was constructed there. Buddha travelled the region where he spent his infancy as Prince Siddhartha.
With the Gautam Buddha International Airport scheduled to come into operation soon, the travel and business opportunities are likely to multiply progressively.
Janakpur is another city that is culturally and historically rich, and famous for being the birthplace of Goddess Sita and mentioned in the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Janakpur, often known as the city of ponds, has over 70 ponds dotting its lush environment.
The city is the capital of Nepal’s Province 2, and the administrative centre of the Dhanusha district. It has the Ram Janaki temple as one of the primary attractions and one of the venerated destinations on the sacred Parikrama (religious pilgrimage) including Ayodhya, Kashi, and Brij.
Plus, it is so close to India, making it a beneficial and advantageous destination in terms of tourism and trade. In other words, it makes Janakpur an excellent destination for MICE tourism.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/best-mice-tourism-destinations-nepal.html,travel
7 places to visit in the Dolpo region of Nepal,"Monday, November 8, 2021","The land of the mythical snow leopard, Upper Dolpo in Dolpa has a lot to offer. Home to the pristine Phoksundo lake, the area is untouched, raw, rugged and extremely beautiful. It’s a place in Nepal that will take you back in time with its simplicity.
Over the past few years, a lot of people have been going to Dolpo to witness the grandeur of the Phoksundo lake. But, the lake is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot more that you can experience in the region. From learning about the Bon religion to visiting one of the highest human settlements in the world, Dolpo will make you come back for more.
Today, we bring you a list of places you can visit when you are in the region.
This pristine lake is the crown jewel of Dolpa. Situated at an elevation of 3,612 metres, the turquoise blue lake is mystical on its own. There is a belief among locals that the lake is so pure that no organism lives there. People are not allowed to swim or boat in the lake, but they do not have to. If you stare long enough at the lake from the multiple viewpoints on the trail, you will definitely be mesmerised.
Another gem in the region is the Shey Gompa or the Crystal Monastery that was built in the 11th century just below the holy Crystal Mountain. Many consider this monastery the spiritual heart of the region and was made famous by Peter Matthiessen in the book the Snow Leopard.
It is also known for its 12-metre tall-breezed golden statue of Shakyamuni (Gautam) Buddha which covers three floors of the monastery. It lies in the trekking route to cross Kanga La pass (5,151 m), which is among the highest passes in the Himalayas, from where one can see the mesmerising beauty of the mountains and panoramic landscapes.
Dolpa is home to the Shey-Phoksundo National Park, arguably the prettiest national park in the country. The place is full of different species like the elusive snow leopard, blue sheep, grey wolf and musk deer among many others. Elevations in the park range from 2,130 m in Ankhe to 6,883 m at the summit of Kanjiroba Himal. Apart from Shey Gompa, the national park is home to multiple other monasteries along with different glaciers. Because this place is remote, many call this place a heaven on earth and a must-visit place if you love trekking.
Dolpa is one of few places where the Bon religion is practised. The Bon religion in Dolpo offers you its unique and primitive culture including monasteries and temples that are practising and preserving the culture of Bonpo (followers of Bon) in different parts of this region. These places seek the attention of the world to preserve and flourish this ancient religion before it disappears.
The village of Dho Tarap is one of the highest settlements on earth. This used to be the capital of Dolpo before Prithvi Narayan Shah annexed it in the 18th century. This village, like others in the region, follows the Bon culture, and there are eight monasteries including a Bon monastery. Dho Tarap is located in a very strategic centre and can be reached in a travel distance of one day from nine different villages of Dolpo.
Ringmo is another traditional village in Dolpo that preaches the Bon religion. The village is small and is by a lake. It sits on the landslide dam that formed the Phoksundo lake at about 3,660 m (12,000 ft) above sea level. A Bon temple also named Ringmo can be found just outside the town, and the river that drains from Phoksundo plunges over an impressive 167 m (548 ft) waterfall about half a kilometre south of the village.
Near Ringmo is the Suligad waterfall, which is 167 metres long. The water comes straight from the Phoksundo lake and is a gem to look at. Not many people venture out to these places. The waterfall drops into the Bheri river forming Thulo Bheri and is quite a hike from Ringmo, but once there, you will surely feel that the hike is worth it.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visit-dolpo-region-nepal.html,travel
Going to Mardi? You can’t afford to not meet Chiya Kaka on Nepal’s popular trekking route,"Sunday, November 7, 2021","At around 3 am, he wakes up and walks towards the Mardi view camp. Walking fast, he surpasses the hikers on the way. On his one hand is a 15-litre water gallon and, on the other, a big bag of tea. When the hikers reach the top of the view camp, a hot cup of tea awaits them. This is how the day of Tanka Prasad Gautam (46) or Chiya Kaka, his alias, goes every day for the better part of the past eight years.
The high camp is the last point with an accommodation facility you get during Mardi trekking. From here, trekkers walk for two hours and reach the view camp before dawn whereas the Mardi base camp is another one-and-a-half hour ahead of the view camp.
From the view camp, one can see nine mountain peaks. When you reach the base camp, you get the opportunity to get close to the mountains, but they are not visible properly. That is why tourists return from the view camp itself, he says. At present, it is not foreign tourists but domestic tourists who throng there.
In the last two years [due to the Covid-19 pandemic], tourists have seldomly trekked to Mardi Himal. The business seemed to have taken a turn for the worse. But this year, the trekking culture has flourished back. So is his tea business.
Everyone calls Gautam ‘Chiya Kaka’ (the Tea Uncle); it has now become his identity. Before he started selling tea, he was Tanka Prasad Gautam. But now, even Gautam answers his name is ‘Chiya Kaka’ when anyone asks what his name is. “Even those who have not met me in the past call me Chiya Kaka. Many, in their first meeting, leave a lot of love and compassion. I am happy to be able to serve [tea to] everyone.”
Sometimes, many tourists who reach the Mardi view camp to see the mountains up close return sadly after the heavy fog. But, they always get to have tea at Chiya Kaka’s place. “Many have tea here and take photos of my tea stall.”
But, how did he become Chiya Kaka?
His newfound identity can be credited to Sudeep Gautam, a pioneer businessman from Mardi and Chiya Kaka’s nephew. He also takes the credit for making Mardi a popular trek in a short time. Any tourist or trekker who reached Mardi stayed at Sudeep’s hotel. Tanka Prasad would be at the view camp in the morning and frequently seen in Sudeep’s hotel in the evening.
An uncle of one became the uncle of all. Then following his new tea business, people added ‘chiya’ (or tea) and called him ‘Chiya Kaka’ that stayed with him as his new identity.
When he first started the tea shop, no one was there. But, then with increasing tourists, over time, he alone could not cater to all. Other business persons also set up stalls and, at present, there are five huts of tea sellers in the view camp.
Of the five, the first hut belongs to Chiya Kaka and many first stumble into his stall.
Chiya Kaka, who now sells tea and coffee at Mardi view camp, actually wanted to be a shepherd. Born in Siding near the mountain, his skill was to raise sheep and goats. His previous generation used to raise sheep on route to the Mardi trek and even had a shed there, shares Kaka.
There were no other employment opportunities in the village, neither starting a business was easy. So, like many other villagers, he also made his passport and went abroad to the Gulf countries for foreign employment and worked in Malaysia, Qatar and the UAE. “In the beginning, it was Rs 25,000, then I earned up to 35,000,” says Kaka. At that time, Rs 35,000 was a big amount for him, he started sending money to the family.
It was only a matter of time, and he returned home. Upon return, he first thought he would go to the village and raise sheep. But, then, he saw that the number of tourists trekking in Mardi Himal had been increasing. Tourists had to walk more than two hours from the high camp to the view camp, and there was no accommodation, nor a source to drink water.
A batch of tourists returning from the view camp talked on the way about how wonderful it would be to have tea at the upper camp. So, he took the opportunity and started selling tea there. After starting the business, he has never had to look back with a decent income from the start. “What I earned in a month in the Gulf country, I can earn here in four/five days now,” shares Chiya Kaka.
Nonetheless, his business is not as smooth during the off-season for tourists. Yet, he is now happier to at least work in his own country.
For tourists who reached the mountains in the harsh cold winter, it was a great relief for them to be able to have tea.
“There was once a couple from Switzerland who reached Mardi. Sitting in my hut, they ordered two cups of tea. That winter was very cold and the tourists were shivering from the cold. Tears were dripping from the man’s eyes and had a runny nose,” Chiya Kaka shares, “I put their tea nearby but they could not hold the cup of tea. It was so cold that their hands stopped working. But, my tea was so helpful to them.”
There is no water in the view camp. He always carries water from the high camp in the wee hours every day. “In winter, the water freezes and I make tea by breaking that ice,” he says.
Moon is setting and the sun is red in the east. The mountains including Annapurna, Machhapuchhre and Mardi are covered with fog. As the fog leaves, the mountains are left glistening and the tourists start taking pictures of and with the mountains. When it gets foggy again, it covers the mountains and the tourists are disappointed. Then, they resort to sipping tea.
“Kaka, make nine cups of tea for us,”  says a young man. “Tea or coffee?” asks Chiya Kaka, noting that coffee is also available as an alternative to tea. The young man questions, “How much does it cost?” and Kaka replies, “150 for black tea, 200 for coffee” and the young man orders nine cups of coffee.
Another team comes, “Kaka, make four cups of tea for us.” And, the process continues. So does Chiya Kaka’s business.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mardi-himal-view-camp-nepal-trek-chiya-kaka.html,travel

Nepal tourism entrepreneurs want a ‘special package’ from govt for the revival,"Sunday, October 31, 2021","Kathmandu, October 31
Tourism entrepreneurs of Nepal have demanded that the government provide them with a special package for the revival of the industry that has been severely hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a recent meeting with Tourism Minister Prem Ale, the entrepreneurs said the government should prioritise the industry’s revival as it was worst hit by the pandemic.
During the meeting, the entrepreneurs informed the minister of several pandemic-inducted problems such as the closure of businesses, nominal arrival of foreign tourists and a lack of foreign currencies among others. Raja Ram Giri, one of the members of the delegation, says they have requested the minister to form a special committee to address all such concerns.
“The minister has listened to us and looks concerned. Now, we will discuss what the special package should include among the stakeholders first,” he says.

For beginners: 7 easy trekking routes in Nepal,"Saturday, October 30, 2021","A lot of people get intimidated when they hear the word ‘trekking’. Many feel that it is just not worth it. The thought of walking for days away from home out in the wild is something they cannot fathom. But, there are some really easy trekking routes in Nepal that be ideal for people who have never trekked, especially during the spring when the weather is just perfect. You get to see blossoming spring flowers, including Nepal’s national flower, rhododendrons.
But, what are these easy routes? And, how does one choose them?
Well, we have brought to you seven of Nepal’s relatively easy trekking routes based on the number of hours one needs to walk and the number of days it takes to complete them.
It is one of the easiest trekking routes that even a baby can do it. There is an option for you to walk from as high as Ulleri where you can reach on a jeep from either Pokhara itself or from Nayapul. For those who can walk, you can start walking from Nayapul itself or go up to Tikedhunda. The trail is simple with a slight uphill on a few sections. Over five days, you will get to experience the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges and the heritage village of Ghandruk. The trail from Ghorepani to Poon Hill is full of rhododendrons. Don’t miss the sunrise from Poon Hill.
The route is straightforward and quite easy for new trekkers. Apart from the last day, when you have to wake up a bit early to head up to the Mardi viewpoint, the trek is as easy as it can get. It is so easy that there have been a few people who have trekked it in just a day. Passing through green forests, the trek passes through lush rhododendrons in the lower elevation. The terrain changes as you go higher up as you get to witness the best angle of Machhapuchare along with Annapurna South and Himchuli. This is one of the trekking routes that does not require you to be fit.
This seven-day trek is one of the shortest trekking routes in the Everest region. The trek can finish in five days but if you spend an extra two days, you can get up from Namche to Khumjung and Khunde, home of a lot of legendary mountaineers. This trek will give you unbeatable views of the Himalayan peaks including Everest, Ama Dablam, Thamserku, Kangteng, Kusum Kangaru, Kongde, Cholatse, Tabuche and Nuptse. It is ideal for those who do not want to go to high altitudes but want to see the mountains.
This three-day trek in eastern Nepal can be quite enriching. The hills are chilly and rocky and even though do not go higher than 3,800 metres, you will feel that you are. The trek starts at Charikot and passes through Nepal’s only ski village Kuri and ends up at the Kalinchok shrine from where you get to witness mountains like Gaurishankar, Jugal, Annapurna and Everest. There are quite a lot of birds too in the area, so watch the skies.
Don’t have time to get away from the Kathmandu valley? There is a trek you can embark on here in the Kathmandu valley itself. The trek starts from Sundarijal from where you climb along the Bagmati river and reach Chisapani. There, you can witness sunrise along with a hike to Chisapani lake. There, the trail goes to Nagarkot through an okay but long trail. One night rest at Nagarkot will take you to Dhulikhel where you end the trek. It may not be one of the exciting trekking routes there are, but if you have never trekked, this is perfect. Go out on the trails and take your family along.
Close to Pokhara, this is quite an underrated trek that can be done in four days. Ideal for beginners, you only have to walk four hours a day walking through a lush green forest full of different flowers and orchids. As you do not have to walk as much, you get to enjoy splendid views of Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri from Bumdi, Panchase Bhanjyang, and Bhadaure.
This is the easiest of all trekking routes on the list as you hardly have to walk uphill. Trekking along the foothill of the Annapurnas, the trek starts north of Pokhara and takes you Kalikasthan, Syaklung and Chisapani and finally ends at Begnas lake. The trek got its name after Prince Charles and his entourage trekked around the area in the 80s.
The trail gives you an opportunity to observe the distinctly different Gurung culture and people along the way. Along with that, you can also get to witness the Annapurna range, along with Machapuchhre and the Langtang range. The trek also does not see a lot of people which means it is perfect during Covid-19 times.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/beginners-easy-trekking-routes-nepal.html,travel
Visit Nepal: 9 top travel destinations for snow-lovers this winter,"Wednesday, October 27, 2021","Travelling during the winter has its own charm. The skies are mostly clear, the sun’s warmth is comforting and if lucky, you might even see some snow. Snow is something that appeals to Nepal’s urban crowd. Their love is evident during the wintertime when most of them flood places like Chandragiri and Phulchoki in Kathmandu and Ghandruk and Sikles outside Pokhara.
Besides these usual places, where else can you see snow? Today, we bring you a list of places where you can go to watch the snow and make snowmen and snow angels.
A place that acts both as a tourist destination and a pilgrimage site, Pathibhara is located at an altitude of almost 3,800 metres and becomes clad in white during the winter. It is quite majestic as the temple located atop a hill offers some magnificent views of the mountains like Kanchenjunga. It is quite a journey to get there, but if you do not have time but have money, helicopter companies provide deals to get you to and back from Pathibhara.
If you have plenty of time, the Everest region should be your go-to destination. You do not have to go to the Everest base camp. You can just hike up to Tengboche to see snow and the snowy peaks that are barren during the autumn and spring seasons. The hike is easy and quite pleasant. While it does not snow as much down low, it does in areas like Namche, Kunde, Khumjung and Tengboche. The view of snow Khumbu from the Everest View Hotel in Syanboche will leave you wanting more.
A day’s drive from Kathmandu, Kalinchok offers a lot. With snowing, pilgrimage, a cable car ride and if lucky, a chance to ski in the valley’s slopes, Kalinchok should be a place on your bucket list if you want to travel to a place with snow this winter. The time to visit this little paradise if you want to see snow is during December and February. This time, you might also be lucky enough to walk through some rhododendron forests along with a view of the Himalayas.
Another place in Dolakha, on the border of Ramechhap, Sailung is ideal for people who want to experience snow. Closer than Kalinchok, Sailung offers an amazing view of the snowy peaks. With hills over 3000 metres, most of the district is blanketed in snow as soon as temperatures drop. The view from some places in the area is quite majestic when there is snowfall as one can see over 100 hills from the area. Definitely, a must-visit if you have not visited earlier. If you have time, you can do both Sailung and Kalinchok.
An underrated gem, Ama Yangri in Helambu is the place to be. A part of the Helambu circuit, the place is white with snow during the winters. The view, which is quite majestic, is secondary. Along with the Langtang range, you also see Panchpokhari from Ama Yangri. What makes it better is the view along the top. You will see yaks and yaks, and meadows covered in snow. A place to go if you have not already…
Bethanchok might be the closest place people from Kathmandu can enjoy snowfall. At an altitude of 3,00 metres, the place offers a unique view of not just the mountains to the north, but also of the endless hills.

Snowfall in Daman is a common affair. Close to Kathmandu, this hill station is an ideal destination for people to go play with snow. Apart from that, the place offers a panoramic view of the greatest mountains of Nepal from Everest to Manaslu to the Annapurnas. Sunrise and sunset from the hill station are also quite magical. Given the place is just three hours drive from Kathmandu, the place can be your ideal place to visit this winter if you do not have time.
Sikles is the closest place that people from Pokhara can go to witness snow. Only four hours drive from Pokhara, the Gurung village is a fun place.

It is one of the prettiest places to experience snow. Surrounded by mountains, Poonhil along with Ghorepani has to be on your bucket list if you have not been. It is best to go there during the spring, but for a different experience, travelling there during the winter might be quite an experience.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visit-nepal-destinations-winter.html,travel
10 lesser-known base camps in Nepal that can be your next holiday destinations,"Saturday, October 23, 2021","Trekking, commercial, started in Nepal in the 1960s when Col Jimmy Roberts organised the first trek to Everest Base Camp with six American women. In the following six decades, trekking around various Himalayan peaks of Nepal, either to the summit or to their respective base camps, has been popular among both national and international tourists.
The country has a unique and rich blend of geographical, natural, and cultural diversity to support tourism. Also, in the mesmerising Himalayan trails, one can experience all kinds of local lifestyles, languages, food habits, culture, and people. Trekking can be done in all seasons in Nepal. However, autumn (September to December) and spring (March to May) are more preferred times.
Nepal boasts eight peaks taller than 8,000 metres,  and over 1,300 peaks above 6,000 metres, giving ample opportunities for trekking, both to the summits and to their respective base camps.

10 things you can experience only in Nepal,"Saturday, October 23, 2021","Nepal is a landlocked country, famously called the yam between the two stones. The country is so small that it can be easily missed on the world map. Nonetheless, it is filled with diversity in every aspect. It consists of not only beautiful landscapes but also amazing traditions and languages with multiple ethnic and religious groups. There is so much to experience in this small country. In fact, there are certain things you can experience only in Nepal. Here are some of such experiences:
It must be no surprise that Everest climbing is the most famous thing you can do in Nepal. Climbing the highest peak in the world, which stands at an astounding 8848 metres above the sea level, is not a simple task or an achievement to scoff at. Your endurance and patience must be extraordinary if you want to climb Mount Everest. But, at the summit, the top of the world, you will experience a majestic view, and you are sure to feel accomplished.
If you ever visit Nepal, tasting delicious Nepali food is a must. Nepali cuisines are a perfect combination of flavours, ingredients and cooking styles. Many of these cuisines are inspired by neighbouring countries like China, and India, but they have their own unique style based on geography and climate.
Local Nepali staple foods like dal bhat and dhindo are one of the most popular ones. These are best served with different curries like gundrukko jhol (fermented leafy green pickle soup) or meat curries like chicken or mutton. When it comes to cultural cuisine, Newari cuisines is the most famous one. These dishes are not only made with varieties of ingredients but are also supposed to be healthy and are cooked in less fat.
Jatra is a type of carnival/street festival which is celebrated prominently by the Newari community in the Kathmandu valley. Jatras carry huge importance to the Newari community. Major jatras include Yenya (Indra Jatra), Janbahadya Jatra, Bungdya Jatra, Biska Jatra, Bhoto Dekhaune Jatra, Handigaunko Jatra, etc.
Most of this jatras are celebrated inside the valley with the exception of Shikali Jatra which is celebrated in Banepa and Dolakha Jatra is celebrated in Dolakha. Each of these jatras has its own origins and importance to the Newari community. They are huge events that a whole city celebrates with fervour. They are an experience you should not miss in your Nepal visit.
Lumbini is one of the holiest and most famous Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Nepal and the world. Siddhartha Gautam, who later achieved enlightenment and became Gautam Buddha, was born and raised in this place. He also founded Buddhism, one of the major religions we know today. This place holds the record of his life, and you can find various other sites that hold extreme religious and historical importance. Some of those sites include Maya Devi temple, the Ashoka pillar, Myanmar golden temple, Dharma Swami Maharjan Buddha Bihar, and the World Peace Pagoda.
Bouddha stupa is one of the largest stupas in the world. It is also a popular tourist site in Nepal. It is believed this stupa contains holy relics like pieces of bone from the skeleton of Lord Buddha. Boudha is an important place for pilgrimage and mediation for Tibetans.
This stupa is also used by merchants for peace and resting place. It is a go-to place for the youth and tourists as well. One can find places, people, cuisines and cultures highly influenced by Tibetan culture here.
Another great experience in Nepal is to visit the ‘living goddess’. Kathmandu has a tradition in which young girls from Bajracharya and Shakya clans are considered as manifestations of divine energy. They are known as Kumari. In the Newari culture, Kumari is revered and believed to have the ability to cure sickness. There are many kumaris throughout the cities, but the best-known kumari is The Royal Kumari of Kathmandu. She lives in the Kumari Ghar which is situated in the centre of the city.
These are one of the most important herbs found in the Himalayan region of Nepal, for both economic and medical purposes. There are whole communities that are engaged in the collection and selling of this rare and precious fungi. They are unique as they are parasitic in nature and require a host caterpillar to reproduce. They are found around the altitude of 3500 m. They are insanely expensive such that a single kilogram of these rare fungi can cost around $130,000 in the international market. It also has many health benefits like curing respiratory problems like tuberculosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc. Not only that, but they also have the ability to cure and prevent heart problems.
Nepal is also extremely famous for khukuris. Khukuri is a machete-type weapon which is commonly associated with Gurkha warriors of Nepal. It can be easily recognised because of its distinct curve. Gurkha warriors are extremely famous for their fearless military prowess and excellent performance in two world wars. Due to this reputation of Gurkhas, the value of khukuri has skyrocketed as a souvenir for a knife enthusiast. Small khukuris are also commonly used for cutting and chopping purposes.
Thangka is a type of scroll painting in which a picture of Buddhist deity or a mandala is inscribed. These types of paintings are considered holy and pure in Tibetan Buddhist communities. A thangka can cost from Rs 1,000 to more than Rs 100,000, depending on the process it was made and material used. They are more commonly found in Buddhist houses where they are used for worshipping. Thangkas are also considered as one of the most beautiful forms of art. Many people who are not Buddhists also keep these thangkas in their home to admire their beauty.
Pashmina is considered the softest, fluffy, and highly delicate fibres. These fibres are made with Himalayan goat extract and are also known as diamond fibres. There are varieties of pashmina found in Nepal and the most popular one is known as Nepali Pashmina. This type of pashmina is made with silk yarn combined with pashmina yarn to produce better fibre for extra strength, durability, and quality. These fibres are widely loved all over Nepal and around the globe and are a good investment for your wardrobe.

7 films about Nepal you should watch before your trip,"Wednesday, October 20, 2021","You should watch films about Nepal before visiting the country as movies say a lot about a country. They paint a great picture of the people and places and give the audience a general overview of the place. If you want to visit a new country, it is best to watch a documentary or a movie to get know-how about what to expect from the place and its people.
Nepal is no different. A lot of movies and documentaries have been shot in Nepal that has shown the country to the world. From telling stories about people from the mountains to showing life in Kathmandu and various other cities across the country, directors, both local and foreign, have done a great job in showcasing things Nepal offers to the world.
Today, we bring you a list of such films about Nepal, which are a must-watch before you plan on visiting Nepal.
Hare Rama Hare Krishna starring the eternal Dev Anand is an all-time classic that shows Nepal during the hippy era. Shot during the peak hippy era, the film shows how the hippie movement’s drug culture was destroying individuals and families. The movie was an instant hit both in Nepal and India as was its song Dum Maro Dum. Shot all over Kathmandu, the movie was a grand celebration, say Nepali locals. It shows how Nepal was during the hippy era and shows how much the capital city has changed since then. A must-watch!
This movie starring popular Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves helped bolster Nepal’s tourism in the mid to late 90s. The movie paints a picture of ancient Nepal and focuses mostly on the life of the Buddha. Shot mostly around Bhaktapur, the movie did not do well at the box office but helped bring in a lot of tourists to Nepal and Tibet as one of the best films about Nepal.
One of the best films about Nepal, this movie did more than what Little Buddha did; it introduced Nepal’s Himalayas to the world. Set around the untouched region of Dolpo, this was one of the first ‘Nepali’ films to receive an Academy Award nomination. It shows how a group of people from the rain shadow area of Nepal used to make annual treks with a caravan of yaks to trade salt for grain. The filmmaker Eric Valli used locals of the region for the movie, which makes the movie extra special. Foreigners who come to Nepal to visit Dolpa even today say they have come only because they watched Himalaya.
The Wildest Dream is a 2010 theatrical-release feature documentary film about the famous adventurer and climber George Mallory who disappeared on Mount Everest with his climbing partner Andrew Irvine in 1924. The film shows life in the mountains and profiles Mallory and Conrad Anker, who discovered Mallory’s body in 1999. In this documentary, Anker tries to climb Everest in the same manner Mallory did in 1924. It is not a movie specifically about Nepal, but still worth a watch as it shows people the hardship of climbing a mountain over 70 years apart.
This Spanish movie, as one of the best films about Nepal, paints a real picture of what Nepal is about. It does not show you mountains or temples; it shows you a harsh reality of what Nepal really is. It shows poverty, Nepal’s bleak education system and social discrimination. The movie shows the truth and is a must-watch for anyone who wants to visit Nepal… because Nepal is more than just the mountains.
This one is for all the climbers. The movie shows the harsh reality of what it takes to reach the top of the world. It shows the beauty of the Khumbu valley as well as the dangers of climbing a mountain like Everest. Based on Into Thin Air, a book by Jon Krakauer, the movie recounts the 1996 Everest disaster, in which eight people died on their descent from Everest. The movie lacks the nuance that the book provides, but it is still a great watch.
Sherpa is one of the best films about Nepal, a must-watch for everyone who wants to understand the people who live in the shadow of the mountains. While mainstream movies like Everest have not done justice to the Sherpa community, this documentary by Jennifer Peedom has. Focused around the life of legendary climber Phurba Tashi Sherpa, the film explores the Sherpa culture and their spiritual relationship with the mountain, as well as the heavy work and risks Sherpas take in making multiple ascents to take equipment and supplies up the mountain and make the climb possible for foreign climbers.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/films-about-nepal.html,travel
Purnima Shrestha: A photojournalist’s bid to establish herself atop mountains,"Tuesday, October 19, 2021","On October 2, Purnima Shrestha and Pasang Lhamu Sherpa became the first Nepali women to reach the summit of Dhaulagiri, the seventh highest mountain in the world. The duo had tried to scale the mountain with different expedition agencies during the spring, but due to unfavourable weather and other circumstances, Shrestha and Sherpa had to cut short their summit bid.
But, on October 2, the duo created history and etched their names in the record books.
“You never know what happens when you’re up in the mountains. Both your next step and breath can be your last,” says Shrestha. “There are times I feel I will not come back. But, I always set a goal before I get up a mountain and the goal is to come back safe.”
Born in Arughat, Gorkha, the mountains never appealed to Shrestha. Growing up, she barely saw them from her village. But, as time went by, her love for the mountains grew.
A photojournalist by profession, Shrestha got to travel all over Nepal. In 2017, she went to the Everest Base Camp to cover the Everest Marathon. It was then when she was pulled towards the mountains. Talking to foreigners who had come to climb the mountain, she understood why they came to Nepal. It was then that she decided that she too would climb.
Today, she is on a mission to climb all eight-thousanders in the world despite several challenges.
“I wanted to climb Everest. But, everyone suggested I opt for a smaller mountain, which is why I went to Manaslu in my home district first,” she says. After summiting the eighth highest mountain in the world, in 2018, she started dreaming about Everest.
The dream became a reality as she reached the top of the world on May 19, 2018. After Everest, she set her sights on Ama Dablam, also known as ‘mother’s necklace’. Determined to summit one of the most technical mountains in Nepal, Shrestha reached the summit of Ama Dablam on November 10, 2019.
“It always looks easy to climb a mountain from afar, but when you get up close, you get a bigger picture of how hard it is going to be. Every step is important and if you make one mistake, you might die. If you look at it, if you win, you’re a summiter; if you lose, you’re dead,” she says.
She says mountaineering is like playing with fire. To her, this is like romance but not with a person, but with death. She says there are times she questions herself why she is up there. Taking loans of millions of rupees, she thinks she is going up to meet death. But, her day is yet to come as she continues to surprise herself with one summit after another.
Mountaineering gives her added energy, she says. After each expedition, she comes back with added zeal and enthusiasm. She feels alive.
“After coming back, I always feel nothing in this world is impossible. All you have to do is keep focus and you’ll be sorted for life,” she says.
She wants to climb one mountain every year. That plan was almost halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but she did not let it affect her as she reached the top of Annapurna on April 16 and Dhaulagiri most recently.
“I want to climb all 14 eight-thousanders. They appeal to me and call me,” she says.
But, she knows it is not going to be easy. Mountaineering is an expensive sport. It can take anything between Rs 1.5 million to Rs 3 million to climb an 8,000-metre peak. While she has been taking loans to reach her goals, the next phase is not going to be as smooth as she will have to go to Pakistan and China to climb a few of the remaining 8,000-metre peaks.
She has been receiving some sort of help though. The Gandaki provincial government and officials from her local government helped her out when she went climbing Annapurna I during the spring as she looks for more sponsors for the remaining mountains.
“It’s quite expensive to go on an expedition that is why I get really sad when I do not reach the summit,” she says.
That was what had happened in the spring when she tried to get to the summit of Dhaulagiri. Due to bad weather, her team had to return from the mountain and end their summit bid. That was a kind of reality check, she says.
“We were lucky this time around. The weather was on our side as we reached the top,” she says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/purnima-shrestha-nepal-mountain.html,travel
Why visiting Nepal in the monsoon is a good decision,"Monday, October 18, 2021","Many of you already know that the monsoons rule over Nepal in the summer months. Therefore, summer is not exactly a popular travel time among tourists, which of course is also noticeable in the airfare. If you look early for cheap Nepal flights for the summer via flight search portals such as Skyscanner, you will often find real bargains for less than € 500.
In fact, I am getting more and more messages from tourists who are about to travel to Nepal in the summer. Often, it is about the travel conditions – and possibly restrictions – during the monsoons. Lately, there has also been an increasing number of inquiries about security. The images of the flood disasters in the south of Nepal have understandably burned into the minds of many.
First of all, I would like to correct the error of many travellers. Monsoon does not mean it rains all day! It, in fact, has some positives too.
The monsoons in Kathmandu are usually characterised by the fact that the temperatures and humidity are a lot higher than those during the dry season. A slightly oppressive sultriness is noticeable in all travellers. Some cope better with it; others need a slightly longer acclimatisation period. The monsoon rains provide cooling. Usually a relatively short but heavy rainfall, sometimes, it is so strong that the soil or the sewage system cannot absorb the water masses.
Despite the sometimes very muddy streets, everyday life in Kathmandu is hardly restricted during the monsoons. What is cursed as an annoying and uncomfortable climate phenomenon for many travellers is a blessing for their respiratory system for Nepali people because most of the year the air pollution in Kathmandu is unbearable.
As soon as the monsoon subsides, particulate matter pollution in the capital rises again. In the winter months (the period with the least rainfall), the standards of the WHO for clean, harmless particulate matter values ​​are exceeded in Nepal by a factor of ten. People are even instructed to avoid all outdoor sports and physical activity and never leave home without a respirator.
The values ​​of the measuring stations set up at 17 locations in the Kathmandu valley show terrifying figures. The differences in particulate matter pollution between the monsoon peak (July) and the driest time (January / February) are incredible.
ALSO READ:
The graphics already show the positive effects of the monsoons in Kathmandu. But, the monsoons also play a decisive role in agriculture and are urgently needed. Without monsoons, there would be no fertile soil, no river level, no groundwater. The monsoons are absolutely necessary for survival! It is an integral part of a climatic cycle that affects an entire subcontinent.
Unfortunately, natural disasters caused by the monsoons have increased in recent years. Floods, landslides and mudslides destroy more and more livelihoods every year and cost more and more lives. Especially in the south of Nepal, on the border with India, the monsoons are more extreme every year. The monsoon rains are much heavier, the duration much longer. One can hardly speak of a “normal” cycle. As early as the beginning of April this year, heavy rains in southern Terai resulted in many deaths.
How much longer can we use the word “extreme” in connection with heavy monsoons when the extreme has already become normal?

Nepal is more than just the Himalayas and Buddha,"Saturday, October 16, 2021","Most people in the world associate Nepal with the Himalayas and Buddhism. What many do not know, however, is that the Himalayas and Buddhism only make up a small part of the country. Okay, I have to admit I have never used the word “small” in connection with the Himalayas
But, even travellers to Nepal often return from their vacation with this distorted picture. When I talk to people who have already been to Nepal, I always hear about the friendliness of the Nepalis, the fascination with Buddhism, and the breathtaking mountains. These three points are always mentioned first – by travellers travelling with a tour group.
Incidentally, this limited perspective of many tourists has led to the creation of the website Ask Me About Nepal, by Nikki Thapa.
The founder wrote to me: “My idea is to tell the world that Nepal is not just the land of Everest or Buddha, nor it is limited to the Newars of Kathmandu valley or Sherpas of high Himalayas.”
First of all, I want to make it clear that it is not wrong to mention the Himalayas and Buddhism in the context of Nepal.
My Nepali friends and I are just very amazed that most of the time it is just what tourists limit themselves to.
We ask ourselves how such an image of Nepal comes about when not even 10% (!!!!) of the population of Nepal follow Buddhism and the mountains do not make up the majority of the natural diversity of Nepal.
We, therefore, suspect travellers only want to see what they believe is an integral part of Nepal. What is now part of Nepal is externally attributed to the country by other tourists, tour operators and the media.
Only the properties that are also “sexy” are mentioned; that is the Himalayas and Buddhism. All mountain lovers and hikers find the Himalayas attractive. Buddhism is currently very popular in the western world. And, that is how it is advertised for Nepal … And so the Himalayas and Buddha are on everyone’s lips with tourists.
Right from the start, I was fortunate that I found a place with the Nepalis. From the first day, I learned a lot more about everyday life, traditions and customs. In the meantime, my friends Rajeev and Vishal have founded a small accommodation in Kathmandu, which I always find accommodation during my travels. The big advantage is that the guys can answer all my questions about the country, the culture, society, religion, customs and even the political structure.
Each of our guests will be able to confirm that their stay with us has broadened their Nepal horizons. That, thanks to they stay with us, Nepal is now much more for me than originally thought.
You can only learn more about the country if someone can explain something to you.
You can only penetrate the tourist bubble of the Himalayas and Buddhism with a suitable contact person on site, and only then will you be able to immerse yourself in the real everyday life of the country and get to know the many facets of the country. This is the only way to change the personal image of Nepal.
Of course, the Himalayas and Buddhism also play a role in our travels – but as part of the cultural and natural diversity of Nepal, there is so much to see.

9 one-day travel destinations for people in Kathmandu,"Thursday, October 14, 2021","Life in Kathmandu, the hustling and bustling capital of Nepal, can oftentimes be overwhelming. Everyone is looking for a quick escape from a rather monotonous lifestyle, but travelling afar is not quite practical either. The solution to it is travel destinations that one can travel in a day.
But, believe it or not, Kathmandu and its neighbouring towns are filled with various travelling destinations, enough to keep people entertained. What is more amazing is to know that you can visit those amazing places, and return to your residence in Kathmandu on the same day. Here are some of the wonderful places for one-day travel destinations for you if and when you are in Kathmandu:
Some 2,551 metres above sea level, Chandragiri hill is a beautiful place located 16 km southwest of central Kathmandu. There are various ways through which one can reach the top of the hill: using the cable car, driving or hiking.
Taking a cable car takes you to Chandragiri in just about 10 to 15 minutes. But, you will get the best of experience if you choose to hike. And, you can reach there in two hours or less. This makes Chandragiri one of the top one-day travel destinations for Kathmanduities.
At the top of the hill, one can visit the Bhaleshwar Mahadev temple and enjoy the panoramic views of the Kathmandu valley, surrounding green hills and mountain ranges from Annapurna to Everest.
If you are into the culture more than nature, Bungamati, which is around 10 km or 45 minutes drive away from Kathmandu, is your one-day travel destination. You can enjoy a simple, traditional Newa village-town untouched by modernisation.
Reaching Bungamati gives you a special opportunity to learn about the culture, traditions of rural and indigenous people in the Kathmandu valley. Bungamati village has become an attractive place with a number of ancient temples which overlook the Bagmati river in the backdrop of mountains. Bungamati is also said to be the birthplace of Rato Machhindranath, the patron god of Kathmandu valley.
Khokhana is another ancient Newa village-town that you can visit on your one-day travel. Though it is a bit smaller than Bungamati, the two villages consist of various features of traditional and cultural importance and are filled with pleasant natural resources.
In the heart of Khokana, one can engage with friendly villagers, observe their traditional, religious practices and also visit their famous Shikali temple. If you go there during October, you might get a chance to see their Khokana festival, where masked dancers liven the streets to honour the goddess Shikali.
The Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park is the closest national park to Kathmandu. It is located only 12 km away from central Kathmandu making it a great option among all the travel destinations. The Shivapuri hill stands tall at an altitude of 2,563 metres and is said to be the second-highest hill near Kathmandu. The national park spreads over 159 square kilometres, consisting of various species of birds, butterflies, animals, and mushrooms.
One can take a private or public vehicle up to Budhanilakantha, the gateways to the park. It is a 15 km hike to the peak that can take you around six hours to complete. But depending on your preference, you can hike to other stops along the hill; Bishnudwar and Baghdwar are particularly famous and you can enjoy various waterfalls and beautiful scenery.
Another major tourist destination of Nepal, Dhulikhel is a hill station situated 30 km east of central Kathmandu. It is also a perfect one-day outing destination for you. You can easily reach there within one to two hours of the bus ride and come back to Kathmandu the same day.
Dhulikhel consists of natural beauty as well as the mesmerising scenery of snow-clad mountains such as Mt Annapurna, Mt Ganesh Himal, and many more. In addition, it is also full of religious and historical resources. Not only that, if you are up for an adrenaline rush, you are always welcome for a bungee jump and zipline, in and around Dhulikhel.
Phulchoki lies southeast of the Kathmandu valley. The Phulchoki hill stands at a height of 2,781 metres above sea level. For this hike, one has to start their journey from Godawari. The hike will be about 15 km; it will take around eight hours for a normal walker to go up and come back down.
It is one of the highest points inside the Kathmandu valley which offers beautiful hiking trails full of greenery. During the hike, one can enjoy nature, enjoy the company of a variety of flora and fauna. From the top, you can enjoy the majestic view of the mountain ranges around the Kathmandu valley. And, if you go there during winter, just after a rainy day, you might even witness snow, which is a rare phenomenon in core Kathmandu.
A hill station in southeast Kathmandu is Lakuri Bhanjyang. It is popular as a picnic spot and one of the easiest travel destinations to choose from. But, one can also go up to the peak of Lakuri Bhanjyang via vehicle or on foot, which is completely your choice.
However, for a more immersive experience, it is better if you hike and take in the fresh breeze, break a sweat, and enjoy nature. It is just a two hour-walk from Sanagaun/ Siddhipur or Lamatar, the base of Lakuri Bhanjyang. Like other hikes, the peak of Lakuri Bhanjyang too offers you amazing scenery of snow-capped mountain ranges as well as the entire view of the Kathmandu valley.
Nagarkot is renowned for its breathtaking scenery of sunrises, sunsets, scenes of mountain ranges, including Mt Everest. Except for sightseeing, Nagarkot offers you plenty of options for relaxation, enjoyment and other outdoor activities and which is why it has been one of the popular travel destinations from Kathmandu.
Nagarkot is around 32 km far from Kathmandu but it can be reached by vehicle in just around two hours. If you are more sporty, you can also choose to hike. Starting from an old Newa village, Sankhu in Kathmandu, the total hike is of 16 km distance up to Nagarkot. And, within just three to five hours of hike, one can easily reach the summit of Nagarkot.
Champadevi is on the southern side of Kathmandu. It is the third-highest hill around the Kathmandu valley, at an altitude of 2,278 metres, and is very famous for hiking. People from very far come to hike here and it has been a top travel destination in recent times.
Because of its height, you get the best birds-eye view of the Kathmandu valley and surrounding mountain ranges. On the top of the hill, there is a Hindu shrine, that also conducts a festival every year for Hindu devotees.
You can take the bus going to Dakshinkali and get off at the Khahare bus stop. From there, you will see a sign indicating the start of your Champadevi trail. The total hike is 13 km long, which can take you around six to seven hours to complete.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/one-day-travel-destinations-kathmandu.html,travel
Travelling in Nepal: A meditation that is all about willpower,"Tuesday, October 12, 2021","I was born was in the flat Terai. What I saw was the eternal shore of the Koshi river and the vast plains beside it. The first time I saw a hill and stepped on one was when I came to Kathmandu. It was my first time travelling in Nepal.
It was always a growing dream of mine to see mountains up close and experience their roughness. Then Into the Wild–a biographical adventure movie about a young person’s carefree journey– multiplied those emotions so much so that I wanted to be like that movie’s protagonist.
Then, my dream came true that made me realise different facts about Nepal and travelling in Nepal. Do you want to know about it?
For the first time, I planned a trek to the Annapurna circuit. But, making the arrangements for the trip was not as easy as it was to plan the trip. Why? No one believed me or was willing to accompany me on the trek. But, finally, after repeated attempts, I set out for the Annapurna circuit trek.
I experienced a whole new world while wandering those rough roads of the trek. Those uphills, downhills, gorges and those hilly settlements: I was ecstatic.
After my Annapurna trek, I became more determined to travel; there was no looking back. Now, I go for treks as soon as I get a chance. There is no district left in Nepal that my feet have not walked. Uncountable geographies, varied people, their lifestyles and food: I experienced them all.
I was born in eastern Nepal. But, when it comes to travel, I am attracted by the geography of western Nepal. In comparison, there are more places to travel there from various lakes, fields, waterfalls, to rivers and more.
The places change their appearance according to the seasons. There is greenery now whereas in winter it appears white. And because of this, I visit these places time and time again.
I have just returned from Badimalika. It was my third time there.
It is easier to be in the east than the west be it in transportation or accommodation. There are well-connected road networks. The east is warm and hospitable. In the same accord, the west is rather cautious and embarrassed or scared as far as welcoming new people is concerned.
However, a traveller should not seek convenience. It should be more about excitement for them and the west is perfect for it. Though the west is hard to navigate, it is very tempting. For a fulfilling journey, there must be a mixture of sorrow, happiness, fear and joy.
Sadly, these places have not received their due attention. If there were infrastructure and enough promotions, those areas would have an influx of domestic and foreign tourists. But, travelling in Nepal has made me realise many beautiful tourist destinations have been overshadowed.
Strangely, I enjoy the journey no matter how arduous it gets.
When you are travelling in Nepal, you have to be ready to face any kind of situation be it fatigue, hunger, fear, or anything else. You might have to walk hungry, have no decent place to stay, meet unwelcoming hosts, people smoking marijuana or people with good and bad intentions.
On this journey to Badimalika, I met a helpful young man. I followed him as he walked through the forest. But, as the night got darker, we lost our way, yet we did not stop walking.
We could hear the gushing sound of water somewhere far. Only after walking downhill, we found it was a huge and very intimidating waterfall.
After more walking, we finally reached a cowshed. We saw three children there who got scared of us at first. But, after many requests, they agreed to guide us to a place where we finally got a place to stay.
Lately, I have been walking with my dog. The cowshed we found was because we followed the dog who led the way through a narrow path.
I had just bought a Siberian husky ​​during the recent lockdown and I named it ‘Covid’ because I bought it at the time of the pandemic.
I have been walking with him, but walking with a dog increase the travel costs. Nevertheless, travelling with a dog as a partner is a different joy, you can exchange your grief. After all, dogs are said to be human’s most loyal companions.
In the cities, we practice meditation. We do it by first sitting in Padmasana, practising to concentrate on our breath with our eyes closed. But, such a practice is spontaneous and voluntary while travelling.
While walking, you can feel the motion of your breaths, their speed and you are not as distracted. Your focus stays within you, your journey. And, this brings a different kind of peace and happiness.
But, in Nepal, we do not have a culture of travelling. Whenever one plans to travel too, a lot of things come in between like work, money or time. So, travelling on a whim is not common.
Here I want to say, what you need is willpower and not money or free time to travel.
In the beginning, it might be difficult to muster the courage to just start, to get up and travel. But, I have reached many parts of the country, some places more than once. In fact, I am still travelling.
And, with all that experience of travelling in Nepal, I can attest it is more about the willpower you have that will help you travel.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/travelling-in-nepal-is-a-meditation.html,travel

Will an ascent of Manaslu ‘true summit’ end a historic debate on Nepal mountains?,"Tuesday, October 5, 2021","When Mingma Gyalje Sherpa (better known as Mingma G) announced that he was going to the “true summit” of Manaslu this autumn, everyone was sceptical. Why would not they be? No one had been there for the past 45 years.
According to the Himalayan Database, the last people to reach the main summit during the autumn were Iranian Mohammad Jafar Assadi, Japanese Jun Kageyama and Nepali Passang Sherpa in 1976. Since then, many have tried, but no one had reached the mountain’s true summit. But on September 27, a team of highly skilled mountain guides led by Mingma G reached the true summit of the mountain as they became only the second team to reach it during the autumn season.
Between these years, one team made it to the true summit in spring, but no one could in autumn.
It means several dozens of Manaslu summits reported in the autumn season between 1976 and 2021 were not about the “true summit” but a lower point. Hence, Mingma G says all of them were controversial and his team ended that now onwards. However, other stakeholders including the government authority say they are not certain yet.
“The Manaslu controversy has been plaguing Nepal’s mountaineering industry for years. Ever since I found out that the point where I stopped before was not the true summit, I wanted to get to the real one,” says Mingma G, one of the climbers who created history by summitted K2 in the winter. “This year I told everyone, from my team to my clients to others on the mountain that I was going to go to the true summit.”
Over 2,000 people have climbed Manaslu since it was first climbed in 1956. But, how many reached the mountain’s true summit has always been questionable. The Himalayan Database data suggest the last team to have reached the true summit in the autumn was the Japanese and Iranian team of 1976 while they say Guy Cotter who led his Adventure Consultants’ group was the last to reach the true summit in 2012 spring.
Since then, many have claimed to have reached the mountain’s true summit, including popular mountaineers like Adrian Ballinger, Andrej Bargiel, Edurne Pasaban and Nirmal Purja among many others but it looks like that their attempts might have an asterisk put next to them as they might not have reached the true summit.
“Many people are unaware that there is a fore summit and a true summit. I hope I’ve finally put this debate to rest and people will no longer stop at the fore summit claiming that it’s the true summit,” says Mingma G.
Following his tracks, other teams also got to the true summit, says Mingma G.
Following Mingma G’s accent to the top, Pakistani climber Shehroze Kashif has said he will be coming back to Manaslu as he had not reached its true summit. Posting a video on Instagram, the 19-year-old said he did not know about the summit controversy and although he had received the certificate, he would not be counting this summit which is a part of his project to climb all 8000-metre mountains and said he would return to Nepal to reach its true summit.
“What Mingma G did was amazing and I hope I can get there and earn my summit certificate,” said Kashif on Instagram.
But, why do not they fix the ropes to the true summit?
Well, a few mountaineers say that fixers are lazy. As it has been the norm to fix ropes to a certain point, they stop there. The last part of the climb is quite tricky too as the final ridge is narrow and does not have good spots to put up anchors.
“I tried walking through the ridge, but I felt it was too dangerous. Only slip and the entire team would be affected, which is why I went down and traversed it diagonally and then climbed up,” says Mingma G, adding it took him less than 20 minutes to reach the true summit from the fore summit.
This moment has been beautifully captured by photographer and climber Jackson Groves where it shows Mingma G leading from the front while some members of his team are following him while some are waiting at the fore summit for his green signal.
“That was quite cool, no,” he says.
The Himalayan Database hopes that things will change from 2022 onwards as now they have all proof of what the true summit looks like. The institution is considered an authority across the world when it comes to Himalayan mountaineering.
Billi Bierling, who leads the legendary institution, says the team will sit together and come up with a strategy on how to deal with future and past summits. “What Mingma G has done is remarkable and impressive. Hopefully, this puts this debate to rest,” says Bierling.
She says it is likely that the organisation would only be taking Mingma G’s 2021 summit as the real summit.
“We can’t change history, but what we can do is put up a note next to the old summits and say that these were considered summits until 2021. But, now thanks to Mingma G and technology, we have proof of the summit and the way to the summit and will likely only take his summit as the real summit.”
Apart from the database, the Department of Tourism that offers summit certificates to climbers to reach the top will also have to make changes. But, the department’s director Meera Acharya says the department is not aware that Manaslu has two summits. She says the department had been giving certificates to everyone after confirming from the expedition organisers.
“This is news to us. We’ll discuss it among ourselves and expedition operators,” says Acharya.
In the meantime, Bierling admits there is risk in going to the true summit and the extent of the corniced ridge was previously not known. This is why Elizabeth Hawley, the founder of the Himalayan Database, gave leeway to climbers. She says that many commercial teams will still go to the fore summit and the database will record it as the fore summit and not the true summit.
Meanwhile, Mingma Sherpa, the chairman of Seven Summit Treks, a leading expedition organiser of Nepal, says people cannot discount those who have reached the fore summit as the government has been recognising the summit.
“It’s the same if you look at it,” says Mingma Sherpa. “If people want to go to the other summit, we’ll take them, but be rest assured, if more people start going there, there will be more deaths and that is bad for Nepal’s mountaineering.”
“Remember that almost 90 per cent of accents of this mountain have been until the fore summit,” he says.
But, Bierling says that the two summit’s heights are not the same and these claims are quite baseless. Mingma G, on the other hand, is hopeful this will change. “Most people will demand to get to the true summit. I’m sure things will change because like I said before, a summit is a summit.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/manaslu-true-summit-nepal.html,travel

Visit Nepal: Which is the best season?,"Saturday, October 2, 2021","Nepal is a country filled with rich natural beauty and cultural history. The country is the land of Mount Everest and also the deepest gorge/valley, Arun valley. It is the land of brave warriors and the land of peace as the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha.
The diverse resources that are full in the country make it perfect to visit Nepal throughout the year. Having said that, there are a few places that are more suitable for travel according to the seasons. So, here is an overview of places to travel to in Nepal according to the seasons.
Autumn in Nepal welcomes you with a bright blue sky. It usually begins in September and lasts till November with a pleasant breeze and weather of between 18 °C to 22 °C.
This is the best time to visit Nepal and roam around or walk along the trails of fascinating peaks such as Mount Everest, and Mount Annapurna among others. People also love to visit Pokhara for its amazing lakes and mountain views as well as bungee jumping and paragliding during this season. Another popular destination is Ilam and the tea garden.
One can also enjoy various festivals such as Indra Jatra, and the two biggest and important festivals of Nepal, Dashain and Tihar. They are the celebration of the victory of good over evil and one can see the vibrant and lively Kathmandu during the festive seasons.
Winter in Nepal can be a bit restricting if you want to travel the mountains as temperatures can dip till 0 or even to minus. But, the hilly and plain areas are great to travel to. The season begins in December and lasts till February.
Kalinchok, a snow paradise and a popular destination in recent years, would be a wonderful place to travel to during this time. But, if you are up for a challenge, the Ghorepani trek and the Chisapani-Nagarkot trek are there for you. Pokhara, in the hilly region of Nepal, is another great choice to travel with as it is filled with lakes with a backdrop of beautiful mountain ranges and several adventure sports options. Other places one can visit are Nagarkot, Poon Hill, Bandipur, Kakani, Chitwan, and Mustang.
Winter is often referred to as an offseason in Nepal as there are fewer travellers. But, that gives you the perfect opportunity to travel as there is less crowd and more discounts to grab. As winter here can be harsh, one has to come prepared. It is wise to have a proper plan ahead of time and carry thick clothes to keep one warm as well as necessary medicines to keep one safe.
Spring season indicates a new beginning, fresh buds blooming and nature is filled with beautiful flowers and greenery. This season starts from March to May where the temperature varies from 28 °C to 8 °C. If you are a nature lover, this is the perfect time to travel within Nepal.
Spring is the best time for trekking to Ghorepani-Poon Hill and Mardi Himal. Also, one can visit Chitwan National Park and Bardia/Bardiya National Park for the jungle safari. And, one cannot miss the beautiful world heritage sites such as Bouddha, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Pashupatinath, and many more amazing places located inside the Kathmandu valley. People here also celebrate the Nepali New year and the birthday of Lord Gautam Buddha with much fervour.
To travel in Nepal during Spring, it is better to have a light jacket, sunscreen and sunglasses on.
Starting from June to August, Nepal experiences summer with an average temperature of 20 °C to 35 °C. The days are warm, hot, longer with higher humidity. But, this also makes summer a good season for sightseeing and trekking.
In this season, one can enjoy jungle safari in Shivapuri, Banke, Bardiya and Chitwan national parks. Treks to Annapurna base camp, Langtang valley, Manaslu circuit, and Upper mustang are another way one can explore Nepal. You will see beautiful nature, scenarios, diverse culture and traditions as well as wildlife of that region.
If you are more on the adventurous side, mountain biking is also an option for you. For the people who are into history, culture and arts, Kathmandu valley offers various cultural heritage sites that you can visit.
It is also the season of monsoon so you might expect some light to heavy rainfall from time to time, which means you need to plan and carry an umbrella or a raincoat, sunglasses, sunscreen, or light jackets.  Plus, while going through the woods, one needs to be extra cautious as there might be leeches, and other wild animals lingering around.
One should also be mindful as the roads can be slippery, and trekking routes can be blocked due to landslides and other natural disasters. So, one should stay updated with the news and carry light yet warm clothes and sunglasses.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visit-nepal-best-season-to-travel.html,travel
"From Sundarijal to Magingoth: A 2-day trek from Kathmandu, challenging yet fun","Saturday, October 2, 2021","The warm love I received is unforgettable. The new yet familiar taste of Tibetan tea and that fresh batch of chhurpi [chewable hardened cheese] is still with me. Even the so-familiar potato dishes left quite a unique imprint on me.
This was all in my journey from Sundarijal of Kathmandu to Magingoth of Sindhupalchok.
In the rainy season, hiking in itself became challenging. Yet, it was fun thanks to the elements I just mentioned.
Right after a continuous ascent of about two hours, from Sundarijal, we reached Borlang Bhanjyang at an altitude of 1,800 metres. I could still see the sky and the horizon as seen from Kathmandu.
And as we reached the centre of Shivpuri National Park, we began our descent.
Chisapani is a four-hour walk from Sundarijal. Though the settlement is normal, you are sure to get warm hospitality and the place is surely charming. You get a beautiful view of Melamchi as well.
From there, we again descended and continued our journey towards Pati Bhanjyang.
When we heard the name, we wondered why was it called Pati Bhanjyang.
The answer: There was an old phalchha or pati (traditional patio) here, and according to the locals, the place was named after the only pati in the bhanjyang (a saddleback).
From here, our downhill journey ended and now it was time to walk uphill again.
At one’s normal pace, they can reach Thangkuni, the next stop, in just about half-and-hour. One can also reach here by bus, as there are two regular buses coming from Kathmandu. But here, you will not find well-managed hotels.
The next stop is Chipling. For many, travelling on foot, Chipling is where they rest on their first night as there are also plenty of hotels and scenic views to enjoy. But, we did not stay in Chipling.
The next stop for pedestrians is at Golphu Bhanjyang. This is a fairly new settlement of Gurungs, Tamangs, Sherpas and Dalits. The stop is two hours away from Chipling, on foot.
We reached there at 8 pm and stayed the night. Hotels had already closed for the day, but we got shelter at the home of a former armed police staffer. The food there was excellent too.
From Golphu Bhanjyang, our second-day journey started early in the morning. Passing through the settlements there, we reached Kutungsang for breakfast. It was a two-hour walk.
It was here that we got a new taste of corn saatu (flour) and pocha (salt tea).
Kutungsang is one of the entry points for the Langtang National Park.
The place began our journey towards Magingoth through the dense forest of the national park.
On the route there, there were many kharkas (grasslands) and a few abandoned patios. The rest of the journey was uneventful, but we were accompanied by the chirping of birds all along.
But, there were some hurdles too. It was raining and the fog clouded most of the views. Hence, we missed the beautiful scenic sight of Helambu, which would have been visible if the sky was clear.
In that three-and-a-half-hour walk, we reached Magingoth. There were about half a dozen hotels in Magingoth. We stayed at Kalu Sherpa’s Green View Hotel. Next to our hotel, there was a yak shed/farm.
My experience there was particularly warm and of new taste as the shed owner, Karsang Dawa, offered the Tibetan tea, the chhurpi and a new taste of locally-grown and homemade potatoes.
The two-day trek was very fruitful for me.
Magingoth, in Helambu-7, is in fact a must-visit destination for anyone.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sundarijal-kathmandu-trek-magingoth.html,travel

Nepalis visiting a Gulf country or Thailand needs only USD 250 at least,"Thursday, September 30, 2021","Kathmandu, September 30
Nepalis visiting a Gulf country, a SAARC member state, Malaysia or Thailand needs only USD 250 to carry with them to leave the country on a visit visa.
Previously, one would exchange at least USD 500 to visit one of these countries.
A ministerial decision on Wednesday lowered the requirement of the money one needs to exchange for a foreign trip, informs Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, the director-general of the Department of Immigration.
“If they have a letter that shows there are sponsors, that money is not necessary,” he says.

"Manang is open to foreign tourists, but health protocol compliance is mandatory","Wednesday, September 29, 2021","Manang, September 29
The Manang District Administration Office has allowed the entrance of foreign tourists to the district amid Covid-19. But, it has imposed health protocols.
The visitors must have a Covid-19 test report, hotel bookings and be fully vaccinated against the virus, says Chief District Officer Bishnu Lamichhane.
“The infection has not been controlled fully. Only infection rate is decreasing. Health protocols should be followed while reviving tourism amid the infection,” he says.
The decision in this regard was taken by the meetings of the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee and the District Administration Office, he says.
Meanwhile, one visiting the district needs to take permission from the district administration. Those entering the district should be tested for the infection.

Diplomats gather in Pokhara to revive Covid-19-hit Nepal tourism,"Wednesday, September 29, 2021","Just as the clouds were covering the Annapurna range, Park Chong-Suk, South Korean ambassador to Nepal, quickly took a selfie with his wife. This was at Naudanda, a few kilometres away from Pokhara, the tourism capital of Nepal.
Waking up early, the diplomat was treated with a view he had only seen in pictures. Almost the entire Annapurna range was visible, and he could not wait to go to a higher point to witness the grandeur of the mountains.
Ever since he was appointed the ambassador last year, he had always wanted to visit Pokhara. But, due to work issues and the Covid-19 pandemic, he could not.
As he moved towards the Kaskikot palace, he was even more mesmerised. To the south was the Phewa lake and Pokhara city and to the north was the Annapurna range. Looking at them, he stood there, speechless taking it all in.
“I feel fortunate to have been here. The views I’ve seen today are amazing,” says the ambassador.
As many as 11 ambassadors and various other diplomats were in Pokhara earlier this week. They were there to visit the place and to encourage people to come to visit Nepal, post Covid-19. Park Chong-Suk was joined by German Ambassador Thomas Prinz, UN Resident Coordinator Sara Beysolow Nyanti, and various other diplomats. This visit was a part of an initiative by the Gandaki government to promote tourism in the province.
According to statistics, around 40,000 Koreans come to Nepal every year. That number now, due to the pandemic, is zero.
“I knew Nepal was pretty, but I didn’t know it was this beautiful. I’ll surely encourage people of my country to come to visit Nepal and immerse themselves in the culture and tradition,” said Park.
Similarly, German Ambassador Prinz said he was blown away more by the hospitality than the natural beauty of the place. Talking to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief of Protocol Durga Bahadur Subedi, he said this might have been one of the best days of his life.
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment,” he said.
Prinz has been in office for less than a month and was quite happy having had the chance to visit Pokhara in such a short time.
“I’ve been to many places, but Nepal is incomparable,” says Prinz. “The natural beauty coupled with the people and their hospitality has left me speechless. I’ve never seen that anywhere in the world.”
The tour, organised on the occasion of World Tourism Day, was primarily aimed at helping Nepal’s Covid-19-hit tourism industry get back to its previous status following the government announcement to restart the on-arrival visa service.
UN Resident Coordinator Nyanti reached Sarangkot and put up a video, encouraging people who follow her and the world to come to visit Nepal.
“Nepal is open,” she said in the video as she stood in front of the Annapurna range.
Apart from hiking to Naudanda, they also visited Davis Fall, indulged in boating in the Phewa lake, visited the Tal Barahi temple and observed the evening aarati. Almost all ambassadors spread the message that Nepal was a safe place to visit. Noah Mehdi Ahmed, Egypt’s ambassador to Nepal, like everyone, reiterated that she would ask her country’s citizens, who like travelling, to visit Nepal. Around 10 million Egyptians leave the country for holidays every year, she said.
Pertti Anttinen, Finland’s head of mission in Kathmandu, stated that Nepal had a lot of promise and added that Nepal is much more than just the Kathmandu valley and the mountains.
This was the first time that 11 different ambassadors had graced an event like this. Tourism professionals, particularly from Pokhara, feel that this will help boost tourism in Nepal.
Pokhara Tourism Council’s vice-president Pom Narayan Shrestha says events like these give tourism entrepreneurs hope because Pokhara will be every tourist’s second choice after Kathmandu.
“We’re hopeful things will turn a corner now after the pandemic,” says Shrestha.
Even though ambassadors of the US, China and India were also requested to join, none of them came. But, the government has requested them to visit Pokhara soon.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/diplomats-pokhara-nepal-tourism.html,travel
Muktinath temple in Mustang reopens to visitors,"Sunday, September 26, 2021","Myagdi, September 26
The Muktinath temple in Mustang, a holy place of pilgrimage for Hindus and Buddhists, has reopened from today.
A meeting of the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre and the Security Committee held at the Mustang District Administration Office on September 21 had decided to open the temple.
The temple had remained closed since last April owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Chief District Officer Srinath Poudel, who is also the chairperson of the Muktinath Development Committee, shares that worshipping at the Muktinath temple has been opened for the pilgrims and devotees from outside the district.
However, admission to the Muktinath temple premises requires a PCR/antigen test report or the Covid-19 vaccination certificate for the Nepali nationals and a seven-day valid RT-PCR report for foreigners.
After the opening of Muktinath and the tourist spot, the number of people going to Mustang by road and air has increased.
Fifteen people have lost their lives in Mustang, including seven in Ranipowa near the Muktinath temple, due to the coronavirus infection.

Khumbu Climbing Center: Training mountaineering safety on the lap of Mount Everest,"Sunday, September 26, 2021","There is pin-drop silence at the village of Phortse in Khumbu near Mount Everest. Almost everyone from the village during the months of April and May is at the base camp of Mount Everest. Such is the legacy of the place that every household in the village has at least one Everest summitter. Almost all of them are either climbing or supporting the climbers.
Things, however, change drastically around January when the village is full of people from Khumbu and other parts of the country. Aspiring mountaineers, both Nepali and foreign, gather around the Khumbu Climbing Center, a training centre that teaches them about the ins and outs of mountaineering on Nepal’s Himalayas. There, they learn the basics of mountaineering, from tying knots to climbing ice. In 15 days, they go back with the ability to tackle mighty mountains like Everest where most of them go looking for jobs in the spring.
“This is probably my biggest legacy. I couldn’t be prouder of what we have been able to do with this centre,” says Conrad Anker, adventurer and one of the founding members of the climbing school. “I like how this place has changed the lives of so many people.”
The centre was established in 2003 by Jennifer Lowe-Anker and Conrad Anker and is a part of the Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation with the aim of teaching the people of Khumbu the basics of climbing a mountain safely. It has trained  National Geographic athletes like Dawa Yangzum Sherpa and Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita among many others who have been guiding on mighty 8,000-metre peaks like Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and Everest.
The centre is the brainchild of Jennifer who wanted to help the community that spent so much time on the mountains. Things were made easier when locals of Phortse, who had gone with Conrad to look for Gorge Mallory’s body on the north face of Everest, showed interest in such a project. One person at the centre of it was Panuru Sherpa.
“It was clear we needed training,” he says. “I’d been on the mountain many times and had been lucky to come back home to my family. Many, however, were not lucky.”
That drove Panuru to find a solution and when he was climbing with Conrad, he asked him if they would set up a school.
“He was kind enough to say, and by 2003, we started basic and advanced ice climbing courses in Phortse,” says Panuru.
Initially, not many turned up. They felt they were good enough as they had already climbed mountains like Everest. But, soon, that mindset changed as they saw how their peers who had taken the training were gradually getting better.
By 2009, things had developed a lot. Rangers from Yosemite and Denali national parks started coming to Nepal to train Nepali climbers. Nepali climbers were going to these places to learn the art of climbing and safely too. Two families, Lhakpa Dorje, Nawang and Karma Tsering, and Panuru and Pasang Diki even donated their land for a building for the project that was completed in 2019.
“It’s the least we could do,” says Panuru.
The building took time to complete as it was a logistical hassle to get everything up there. But, during that time, the training never stopped.
The training takes place mostly around January when the climbers are free and takes place for 15 days. During this time, they learn the basics: From tying a knot and using crampons to using safety equipment like harnesses, ropes, ice axe, ice screws and pickets.
“What we learn there are climbing techniques. The world says we are not technical and use our physiology to climb, but we want that to stop and show people that we have the technical skills as well,” says Amrit Ale, director of the centre.
He says once Nepali climbers started to take these courses, their technical ability improved. Many realised that they were not climbing safely and that was a real eye-opener.“Climbing, for many, is a necessity. But, this sport or a profession is life-threatening which is why they needed this training and the KCC has been doing just that,” says Ale.
Apart from climbing skills, they are also taught mountain safety, rescue and wilderness first aid. They are also given basic English classes so that the climbers can communicate with their clients and explain to them the things they can expect on the mountains.
“It is very holistic. Our aim from day one has been safety and that is what we go by today as well,” says Ale, adding the English courses have helped climbers a lot.
During the early years, a lot of instructors were from the US, but as time went by, Nepalis started to develop the skill and have been providing training themselves. Ale is one of them who went to the US to get trained in safety and has been going to KCC to teach for the past five years. He says currently 80 per cent of the instructors are Nepali and that the number would be a lot more if there were other few Nepalis who did not return from the US after they were sent there for training.
“We were sent to a school like National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) for training. When some people get ungrateful, others pay the price,” says Ale.
The exchange programme has stopped for the time being as the US stopped giving visas to young climbers owing to the hiding of some trainees in the US.
“It sucks, but it’s okay, I do get to work with people like Conrad, Jimmy Chin, Renan Ozturk when they are in Nepal,” says Pemba, who was rejected a US training opportunity.
He also adds how the KCC has helped the village of Phortse in general. As it is off-route from the main trekking trail, the village sees a lot of tourists who come to see the KCC. That has, to some extent, helped out the village’s economy too.
“There is not a lot to do at Phortse, but people still come and spend time at the KCC. They visit the Jon Johnston Mountaineering Library and the Magic Yeti Children’s Library that have a collection of over 1,200 mountaineering books. “Some books are older than so many people that come there,” says Pemba.
Now, the team is working towards making the centre self-sustainable. It knows that at one point the funding will stop and hence it wants to be ready when it does happen. Ale says it is planning to extend the number of training days from 15 to 21 and is in talks to raise the course fee from Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,500.
The local government of the area has also started to show interest in the school as it has helped so many local climbers get the training they need without having to spend money and go to Kathmandu and take a similar course provided by Nepal Mountaineering Association.
“We have to evolve now. Jenny and Conrad have helped us a lot. Now, it’s our time to work and make this school self-sustainable,” says Ale.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/khumbu-climbing-center-nepal.html,travel
9 major attractions you shouldn’t miss during Annapurna Circuit trek,"Saturday, September 25, 2021","A tourist has diverse destinations and trek options to choose from in Nepal, and the Annapurna Circuit trek is considered one of the most stunning and satisfying ones. More than 25,000 tourists reach the trek route every year; at least 50 tourists visit the trek route in the winter, the least busy time of the year.
Annapurna region, conserved under the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, has major attractive destinations like Thorung La pass, Tilicho, Manang, Mustang, etc. Being a diverse trekking area of Nepal, a visitor can have varying experiences with this trek. And, the best time to embark on the trek is from October to early December and from late February to April.
On the trek, one can get a clear view of Mt Annapurna (8,091m), the tenth highest peak in the world located in this region, and also Dhaulagiri (8,167 m), and Manaslu (8,163 m). Besides, one can also experience numerous waterfalls, beautiful and diverse landscapes, lush green forests, and diverse flora and fauna.

As the circuit is popular with many landmarks, there are many routes one can take within the Annapurna Circuit. There are four major and popular routes, and depending on the route, some major attractions might change.
Nonetheless, here are the major destinations that you should not miss anyway:
To reach the Annapurna Circuit, one will have to first take a road trip to Beshishahar of Lamjung. From Kathmandu, it is a five to seven hours’ journey on a bus. The majority of trekkers start their trek from Beshishahar, the Lamjung district headquarters. But, to shorten the trek, some even choose Chame or Pisang of Manang as their starting point.
The trek from Beshishahar is best suited since you get to experience the trek with beautiful scenic beauty, ancient traditional fountains, and waterfalls.
Located in the Marshyangdi river valley at an altitude of 3,250 m, Pisang village is a deserted village of Gurungs, Ghales, and Tibetan immigrants. There are various ancient-style hotels and lodges to stay in and have beautiful sightseeing having. Taking a tour of the village, you experience traditional beauty, mountains, and simply amazing environment around.
After crossing the Pisang and Braga villages and their amazing landscape and scenic beauty, you reach Manang (3,540 m). Manang is a traditional ancient town with wonderful traditional foundations and astonishing mountain views.
Manang is the largest town on the Annapurna Circuit trek. With arid landscapes, Manang is a rain shadow area with prevailing winds and views comprising traditional villages, temples, monasteries, mountains and viewpoints that relax the trek stress and give soothing relaxation.
The Gangapurna glacier lake is such a lake that gives portrayal of a freezing waterfall. In spring and autumn, it looks cyan; in the monsoon, white; and freezes completely in the winter.
At an altitude of 4,620 m, the froze-up lake is very satisfying to watch on the trek. It is in fact the second most desired tourist attraction in the Annapurna circuit after Tilicho lake. Similarly, the largest and heaviest bird of the mountainous region, the Himalayan vulture, can also be seen roaming in the sky above the lake.
Alpine Homes is a place with colourful cottages or hotels run by the families of locals in Upper Manang. The area with colourful homes below the Himalayas and surrounded by scenic beauty is an attractive destination during the trek to not miss out.
One can rest here comfortably with proper food and lodging as well as enjoy the mesmerising view, take photos, before heading on towards the Tilicho lake or the destinations ahead, along the Annapurna circuit.
Tilicho is the highest lake in the world located at 4,949 m from sea level. This blue lake has a beautiful landscape as it is surrounded by mountains, mesmerising people on their trek. This is the most desired destination to be along the Annapurna circuit trek.
In the mornings, as there is no wind, the water of the Tilicho lake gets very still so the clear still water reflects the mountains on it. Thus, the view becomes even more heavenly. Interestingly, this lake has no aquatic organism recorded to date.
Thorang/Thorung La (Pass), at an altitude of 5,416 m, is the highest point of the Annapurna Circuit trek. Located at such a height, the trek to this point is considered the most difficult and challenging one in the area. But once the trekkers reach the end, it journey will be worth it; one of your life’s biggest achievements.
From the top, one can get a mesmerising view of the Annapurna Himalaya range and Great Barrier Ridge, and the scenic deserted landscape.
At a distance of 1,600 m down from Thorang La, you enter the Mustang district of Nepal. On the trek, you see a clearer view of Mt Dhaulagiri and the deserted hills of Mustang. There lies Muktinath, a popular destination with many visitors and a holy site for both the Hindu and the Buddhist pilgrims.
Going to the lower parts of Mustang, there are places like Kagbeni (2,840 m) and Jomsom (2,670 m) which are unique medieval cities. There is also Jomsom airport in Jomsom where you can take a direct flight to Pokhara and terminate the trek.
Many who wish to make the trek longer, pass through Poon Hill. At an altitude of 3,193 m, the Ghorepani-Poon Hill trek is a bonus destination place to travel even though, the trek from Jomsom to Poon Hill is a different trip and can be tiresome, there are some who go through the trek. The trek is one of the easiest routes separately, and very popular.
With a sight of pleasing and eye-catching sunrise and sunset and a clear view of the mountain ranges and mountains like Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Annapurna I, this place is a famous destination in the Annapurna circuit. On the trekking path from Jomsom to Poon Hill, one can see the blooming rhododendron forest along with places like Larjung, Ghasa and Tatopani and the entire experience will be mesmerising.

Lately, tourists and climbers have preferred a costlier airway to reach the base camp, thanks to a long journey involving hardship and a lack of security and communications along the trail.

As a result, the local economy has been affected. Hotel entrepreneurs and mule transportation services have been marred as they have faced a double whammy of the infection and tourists reaching the base camp preferring airway in many cases.

"Photographing Chhyam Puja at Yalbang Gumba, Humla: A treat of natural beauty and cultural heritage","Saturday, September 18, 2021","The Covid-19 pandemic was raging everywhere. People were locked inside the house. Amidst all this chaos, I reached Humla in April 2021. To be precise, the Namkha Khyangzhong Gumba (Yalbang Gumba) of Humla was my destination. The annual Chhyam Puja there had attracted me there.
It was not my first time at this monastery. My maiden visit was 15 years ago on my way to Kailash Mansarovar from Simikot. Similarly, in 2011, I walked the Simikot -Hilsa-Limi section on the Great Himalayan Trail. At that time, this area was not touched by motor roads.
It took four days to reach Hilsa from Simkot and two more days to reach Yalbang Gumba on foot. On the way, there were herds of buffaloes, sheep, and goats. Some were going to Taklakot with rice and pulses to get back salt while others were returning from Taklakot with salt and wool. However, such scenes have become rare after road transportation has reached there.
This time, I travelled from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj, then to Namkha Khyangzhong Gumba via Simikot. Since the flight was uncertain, we had already kicked off our journey before the puja started. After reaching there, open mountains, warm and blooming spring filled my heart with enthusiasm and happiness before I got to observe a grand cultural event.
Coincidentally, it started snowing when we reached Yalbang. I love to play with the snow, to touch the snow.
And, the day of Chhyam Puja came. On the day, after the rain, the sky looked wide and open. With the vast infinite blue sky in the background, the mountain looked canadianpharmacy365.net majestic. I reached the monastery as early as 6 o’clock in the morning. There was an eternal kingdom of snow.
The rays of the early morning sunlight painted the monastery golden. A lump of melted snow was falling from the roof of the monastery. The sound of chanting was coming from inside the monastery. And, outside, it was mostly quiet.
Above the monastery was a dense forest of angular pine trees, all covered in white snow. And, above the forest, eagles and crows were flying freely in the open sky.
The snow-covered pine forest allured me and I went straight to the forest with the camera lens. The mixed sound of the Karnali river and the wind sounded musical in itself.
Several musical instruments were playing loudly in the monastery. People gathered around the monastery. And, I also joined their crowd.
The monastery was decorated with pomp. To its right were precious Thangka paintings. On the left, Rinpoche and the guests, and in front, the villagers, all wearing masks, were sitting quietly.
Soon after that, a stream of people dressed in very attractive clothes came out of the door of the monastery followed by the playing of musical instruments. They started dancing, making a circle in the empty space in front of them. I also immediately rushed to capture this scene with my camera.
The first dance continued for an hour and the dance was very calm, gentle and meanwhile, very grand. When the fifth dance was over, the atmosphere suddenly deteriorated. All of a sudden, a  loud noise came from inside the monastery.
Some ghosts came out of the monastery dancing, jumping, fighting, shouting and playing thunderous instruments. They jumped up and came to the place where the devotees were sitting.
In a way, the atmosphere was tense and fearful. But, actually, there was nothing to be afraid of because it was a dance that carries the main message of the Chhyam puja.
Explaining the meaning of the dance, the founder of the monastery, Rinpoche Guru Pema Riskal, shares, “According to Buddhist scriptures, until the 49th day after our death, we do not take any new birth. We see a lot of scary things. At that time, hunger and thirst haunt us.”
According to him, earlier, in that period, people see the flash of half of what one will be in the next birth and half of what they are born in. As time passes by, various thoughts come to mind. They feel anxious, due to which many frightening illustrations appear. It makes you panic. From there, the road to heaven and hell is decided.
If you do not recognise that what you see are yourself and your own shadow, you will suffer for many days. Therefore, one should look at their shadow with reverence and understand that that frightening illustration that can be seen for 49 days is none other than one of many forms of Guru Padmasambhava, who is seen due to the nature of Buddha. This is something we have already seen in the Chhyam.
After realising that this is just a form of Guru Padmasambhava,  there is no fear. This is an opportunity to get acquainted with the Buddha. At the end of the dance, Guru Padmasambhava comes in front and blesses us. Then, it is believed that sin is removed and virtue is attained.
Eight Bajra dances based on the biography of Guru Padmasambhava are performed during the Chhyam Puja. This puja, which has been performed for thousands of years, has been performed uninterruptedly at Namkha Khyangzhong Gumba Yalbang for the last 13 years. The Chhyam Puja should be promoted not only religiously but also in terms of tourism.

17 items to carry while trekking in Nepal,"Saturday, September 18, 2021","Trekking is a tiring but fun experience. Walking along the high hills of the Himalayas overlooking all the big mountains is something that everyone should experience at least once.
But, planning for these trips can be quite tricky. What do you pack is a question that comes across everyone’s mind. How much to pack is another question as no one wants to be carrying the excess load while climbing a steep hill at 4,000 metres.
Don’t worry. We have got you covered as we bring to you a list of essential items that you will be needing if you go on a trek, in particular in Nepal, that will last more than four days.
A good rucksack is the most important thing you will need. This is a part of your body so ensure that it is both durable and most importantly, comfortable. You do not want to carry something uncomfortable for five hours a day. A 50L rucksack will be enough for most areas in Nepal, but if you want to go on an adventure later, get at least a 70L one as it is spacious and will save you from carrying an extra bag on longer treks.
While buying your backpack, you should check its straps, if some side pockets and departments are provided and if it has a supporting frame fitted into it. If you have the funds, get a branded one. If not, get a Nepali one but be prepared for it not lasting you more than two treks.
Shoes should be the second most important thing you buy, maybe even the most important. Given you will be walking around five hours a day on average, these should be as comfortable as possible. The boots must have a good grip, their soles a bit hard so you do not feel pointy rock and, ideally, they should be waterproof. Investing in good quality will be worth it.
Also, carry light slippers because you do not want to be wearing the shoes for long.
Many say they do not require trekking poles, but these really help you out during both uphills and downhills. It provides stability and can act as another limb.
It is better to carry at least two litres and an extra thermos for hot water, but it is an absolute must that you carry at least one litre.
Pack only such clothing that you are comfortable in. There is no point trying to be stylish at 5,000 metres so that means no heavy clothes like jeans.
Must carry clothing are:
This is just as important as the shoes you wear. These woollen socks will be your lifesaver in the high mountains.
Pro tip: Always carry an extra pair.
You never know what can happen at high altitudes in the wilderness, which is why carrying medicines for acute mountain sickness, motion sickness, fever and diarrhoea are of utmost importance. Adding to that, antifungal powder, pain relief spray, bandages and ointment for shoe bites, etc are a few of the medicines you should consider carrying in your first-aid kit.
It might feel like you do not need this, but in a country like Nepal trekking without one is plain stupidity. Carry a lot of batteries; you will need them if you want to chase sunrises.
It is not a must-carry tool, but it is ideal if you carry one because you never know what kind of situation you will end up in.
A cap is also okay, but a hat will protect you even more. And you look like Indiana Jones, so it is a win-win. Sunscreen is also mandatory because it gets quite warm up http://getzonedup.com there and without it, you will likely get a horrible tan.
Again not mandatory, but it is better if you carry one as sometimes the lodge you stay in might not be the cleanest and you would not want to sleep in a bed which has not been cleaned for days. That is where the sleeping bag comes in.
This is mandatory. Make no mistake, you will need it. Carry at least three.
The mountain air really dries out your skin and lips and having a little tube of moisturiser and something to protect them both will really come in handy.
One book should be enough, but if you are a reader, carry at least a couple so that you have something to be entertained on while on the trek. For this, those extra head torch batteries will come in handy. Trust us.
If you are a group, board games will be the way forward. Carry a fun one. Not everyone wants to sit and play chess.
This one is completely on you. The high Himalayas of Nepal is drop-dead gorgeous. Carrying a camera will be a hassle, so if you have a nice phone, use that. But, a camera will always capture more. And, the more is what you will cherish when you get back home.
Shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, towels, cold cream, toothbrush along handwashes are a few must-carry items.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/items-to-carry-when-trekking-in-nepal.html,travel

Nepal tourism entrepreneurs urge govt to issue a travel advisory inviting foreign tourists,"Monday, September 13, 2021","Kathmandu, September 13
Nepal tourism entrepreneurs and stakeholders have demanded that the government issue a travel advisory stating Nepal is safe for tourists, claiming the Covid-19 pandemic effects have significantly subsided.
They say Nepal is a safe destination for tourists now as the coronavirus infection rate is decreasing whereas most workers in the industry have been vaccinated.
During an interaction held in Kathmandu on Sunday, they decided to officially put forth this demand to the government.
Meanwhile, the tourism entrepreneurs said the government should remove all quarantine provisions for fully vaccinated tourists and provide on-arrival visas. Likewise, the government should promote Nepal as a safe destination at the international level, they said.
Although domestic tourism activities are on the rise gradually, the entrepreneurs say they are still losing a big chunk of their income as foreign tourists are rarely visiting the country.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tourism-entrepreneurs-foreign-tourists.html,travel
Tsho Rolpa lake: A dream destination that should be on your Nepal trip bucket list,"Saturday, September 11, 2021","With mountains all around, there is a lake in the middle, covered with snow. Tsho Rolpa is like a great painting by a skilled painter; everyone who casts their eyes upon it thinks it is heaven on earth.
It was difficult to reach the lake though. Reaching the shore of the lake filled my heart with the feeling of insurmountable joy. And sitting on the edge of the lake and looking over, I felt like pinching myself to check if I am dreaming.
I am working in the health sector, but I go out of the Kathmandu valley twice a year. But last year, due to the coronavirus spread, it was not possible.
This year, I reached Tsho Rolpa in Dolakha during the third week of April. I made plans many times to go there, but it did not pan out as planned. But once I got there, sitting by the lakeside with the view of the mountains, I was mesmerised by the beautiful view.
My trip was possible with the help of Bikram Bhatta of Zipmandu Travels and Tour.
In all my treks so far, I found that the route to Tsho Rolpa was more organised than others with exceptional views of the surrounding along the road. While travelling to many touristic destinations in Nepal, one has to travel uphill on the way there and downhill on the way back. But here, there were as many ups as downs along the road. The roads were filled with red rhododendrons blooming along the way as if they were welcoming us.
There were 10 of us on the trip and we had fun along the way. The six days of the Tsho Rolpa trek passed in a blink.
The Tsho Rolpa lake is a popular destination for both domestic and foreign tourists. Located in Dolakha, this lake is one of the highest glacial lakes in Nepal at an altitude of 4,580 metres. And, one of the features of the lake is the panoramic view of the Gaurishankar mountain range.
The lake is estimated to have originated only 50 years ago. In 1963, the glacier lake covered an area of only ​​0.23 square kilometres. According to a satellite map of 1997, the lake expanded to ​an area of ​1.65 square kilometres. The depth of the lake is 135 metres.
The first day’s journey can be covered in 10 hours on a jeep from Kathmandu via Dolakha district headquarters Charikot to Chhetchhet village near Singati. You have to walk for three hours from Chhetchhet to Simigaon. That is the end of day one and you stay in Simigaon.
On the second day, it is an eight-hour walk from Simigaon to Dongyang. And on the third day, it is another eight-hour walk from Dongyang to Na village.
On the fourth day, you reach the Tsho Rolpa lake from the Na village.
Returning, first come to Beding. The next day, you reach Simigaon from Beding in eight hours. And on the final day, it is a three-hour walk from Simigaon to Chhetchhet again. From there, you can return to Kathmandu on a jeep.
This naturally-rich Tsho Rolpa lake is an easily accessible destination from the capital, Kathmandu.
Although the local government there is trying from its side, it has not seen the number of tourists as expected, maybe because of weak publicity. Tsho Rolpa trek got the limelight only after there was a rumour that the glacier lake would erupt.
However, there has been little to no effort on publicity from the national level. If the state pays even little attention, this area can immediately become a fast-growing destination for tourists.
At present, the tourism sector is deserted not only in Nepal but all over the world. So, it would be great if we could focus on domestic tourists and promote them at this time and correct our past mistakes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tsho-rolpa-nepal-domestic-destination.html,travel

Dolpo, or Dolpa, is the biggest district of Nepal in terms of area and also one of the most remote parts of the country. The area lies in western Nepal and has a scarce population, limited infrastructures and other facilities. This makes one’s trip even more daring and unique.

Likewise, you can also reach the Shey Phoksundo lake, an alpine freshwater lake, inside the Shey Phoksundo National Park. This lake is one of the deepest and majestic lakes of Nepal giving a heavenly view to the travellers. The trip to Dolpo is one of the most famous trips among tourists.

The destination at a higher altitude allows travellers to have a close view of the third highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga (8,586 m).

Besides this, you can experience the Himalayan wildlife like pheasants and yaks, dazzling rivers and waterfalls, natural hot springs (Tatopani), amazing mountain and hill views, pastoral villages, valleys, and rice fields on the way to Khopra Danda. Due to the remoteness, this region is not exposed much to the travellers as well. The destination also pictures the traditional Nepali lifestyle and exposes various ethnicities of the region.

Promotion of accessible tourism helps boost Nepal economy: Report,"Thursday, August 26, 2021","Kathmandu, August 26
A study has argued the promotion of accessible tourism could help Nepal drive the sector’s recovery and boost the economy.
“Investing in disability-friendly infrastructure and services can help hoteliers and entrepreneurs tap the accessible tourism market in Nepal, a growing segment globally while driving economic growth and accelerating recovery,” says the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
The study was conducted by the Society of Economic Journalists Nepal in collaboration with the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal, which was financially and technically assisted by the IFC.
A Survey on Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities in Nepal’s Hotels covered 90 starred hotels in major cities. While 95 per cent of the participating hoteliers were aware of accessible tourism as a concept, they had not invested in necessary measures to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.
The report mentioned with existing facilities limited to ramps and lifts in most hotels, only 17 per cent of the surveyed hotels put up signs to help visually-impaired guests and 74 per cent of the hotels did not have any Braille signage on door plaques and room directories, according to the survey.
Further, only about nine per cent of the hotels had staff who were trained in or had the basic knowledge of sign language while only 33 per cent of the participating hotels had extra wheelchairs for guests.
“Globally, the concept of accessible or inclusive tourism has gained ground in recent times. Accessibility at tourism destinations is key to responsible and sustainable tourism to ensure everyone can be a part of the tourism experience, regardless of physical limitations, disabilities, or age,” says Wendy Werner, the IFC country manager for Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. “Accessible tourism is not only a human right, but it also makes business sense.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/promotion-of-accessible-tourism-helps-boost-nepal-economy-report.html,travel
Nepal gives many tourists 1-year travel ban ‘for overstaying’ amid Covid-19,"Wednesday, August 25, 2021","Mr M came to Nepal from South America in March 2020. As Nepal was relatively free of the Covid-19 pandemic, he had come here on a holiday with his wife. But, a few weeks after his arrival, Nepal went on lockdown; the government cancelled all flights in and out of the country.
Stuck in Nepal with nowhere to go, the couple rented an apartment in Pokhara and decided to stay there until flights resumed. But, things did not change as much as they hoped they would. There were repatriation flights out of Kathmandu in August 2020, but those were few and far between and none of them flew to South America. While commercial flights did resume in late 2020, they were limited and tickets cost three times more than the actual fare.
“We were stuck. There was no chance to get home, that is why we stayed here,” says Mr M, who asked not to be called by his real name, fearing the government’s wrath.
Mr M finally flew to Kenya on August 5, but the Department of Immigration’s red stamp on his passport, banning him from Nepal for one year, has disappointed him.
“It was quite hurtful because I love this place and have been coming here every year since 2014. I wished the government could be a bit compassionate, but I guess things are what they are,” says Mr M.
This is not an isolated incident. Of late, many foreign tourists have had a red stamp issued on their passports barring them from Nepal for at least a year if they stayed beyond July 29, 2021. This has resulted in tourists having to fly to countries that offer them free visas. Some have flown to the Balkans where they have been getting free visas for a year while some have gone to Africa as Nepal’s immigration department’s ever-changing rules drove them out of the country.
“I’d have stayed had I been given the chance. I’m still willing to come back, but sadly, this red stamp means I can’t come till August 2022,” says Mr M.
But, things have changed since he left on August 5.
On August 20, the Department of Immigration released a notice stating tourists who were stranded in Nepal even if their visa had expired could stay in Nepal until September 29. Even though the department says that this will be the absolute last that it is going to allow people to stay, with rules changing every month, tourists are puzzled if they want to leave or stay put.
“I feel cheated in a way because this is unfair. Had I known this would happen, I’d have happily stayed in Nepal,” says Mr M.
But, it is not that the government has not shown any compassion. Upon orders from the Home Ministry, the department allowed people to be in Nepal for seven months, even though they can only be here for five months on a tourist visa. This came as a boon to many tourists who just could not afford to pay extortionate rates for flight tickets in 2020.
But, things changed in June. The department published a notice on its website asking tourists who had their visa expiring to leave the country by July 29, leaving people like Mr M in a pickle. According to the notice, if tourists did not leave Nepal by July 29, they would be barred from entering the country for a year.
Like Mr M, Linda was red-stamped by the department before she left Nepal for the Balkans. She says it was quite uncalled for during the pandemic. Based in Pokhara, she went to the immigration office there time and again asking for a pardon, but that did not happen. But unlike Mr M, Linda only got banned from the country until December 2021.
“The rules changed which resulted in us making that decision,” says the department’s spokesperson Jhanka Nath Dhakal. “I know that it doesn’t look nice but these decisions come from the Home Ministry. We are just a regulatory body that follows these decisions.”
When asked if people like Linda or Mr M’s red stamp would be removed, Dhakal said that it was unlikely as a decision had already been made during that time.
Dhakal and other government officials say that even though they understand the tourists’ problems, they feel the visitors have had plenty of time to get away from Nepal. But, that has not been as straightforward as they claim it to be. Flights have not been regular as the Delta variant has spread throughout the world.
With most of them yet to be vaccinated, the tourists are scared to leave their bubble and travel abroad amidst the pandemic as they argue that a case-by-case basis needs to be implemented by immigration.
Linda, 65, was terrified to leave, as she had not been vaccinated. But, as the rules stated she had to leave, she did so with a heavy heart. “I would have loved to stay there. But, sadly, the rules didn’t allow for that to happen,” she says.
To make things easy (and complicated), the government has released a new statement last week, in which it writes that tourists can stay in Nepal until September 29. While some have cherished this, others are not as happy.
Ryan is an Australian citizen who cannot get to Australia anytime soon. Tickets cost as much as AUD 11,000, but his main problem is there is a long waiting list that only allows him inside his own country by November.
“I’m desperate to return, but I can’t. I understand the Nepal government’s stand, but I’ll be red-stamped regardless. It’s like being treated as a criminal,” he says.
But, department officials say they are just following orders (from the Ministry of Home Affairs). Spokesperson Dhakal says the decision to extend the date to leave Nepal was made to ensure that tourists like Ryan who cannot go back to their countries have time to find alternate routes.
“We are aware of this and have been holding meetings with the ministry regularly. We don’t want people to feel that they are being cheated,” says Dhakal.
An official from the department tells Onlinekhar on the condition of anonymity that it is not in charge of the rules and that it comes from the ministry. The official says they do not want to be issuing these red stamps as it increases more paperwork for them.
“Who wants to do more work,” he says.
The official adds that they have been trying to raise this issue with the ministry for a long time, but due to ministers changing on a regular basis, their message gets lost.
“We want to make it easy for the tourists, but for now we can’t do anything because the government has just changed, and a new minister is at the helm. If they change things, we can make things easy for tourists; if they don’t, there is nothing we can do,” he says.
But, Phanindra Mani Pokharel, the Home Ministry spokesperson, says whatever the department is doing is as per the law. He does not want to accept that a concrete decision has not been made due to a new minister being appointed recently.
“We’ve been taking action against people who overstayed and sending them back. This is what is in the rule books,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-covid-19-tourists-red-stamp-travel-ban.html,travel

"9 must-visit destinations in Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital","Saturday, August 21, 2021","Pokhara, a mesmerising place just 200 km west of Kathmandu, is on the bucket list of, most probably, every traveller. The city is known as the city of mountains and beautiful lakes, making it a tourist hub for national and international tourists. Though small, the city, also known as Nepal’s tourism capital, has a lot to offer.
Most of the places in Pokhara can be travelled in a day, but it is best if you take time to experience the city’s one element at a time. So, whether you are in a rush or you are a first-time traveller, here are a few must-visit destinations to travel in Pokhara:
The Phewa lake, also spelt as the Fewa lake, is the most popular and most visited lake in Pokhara and in Nepal. What many might not know is that the lake, located in the southern part of Pokhara, was previously known as Baidam Lake.
It is the second-largest lake in the country. The lake is also a famous destination for having a temple at its central part, Tal Barahi Temple. The lake is also renowned for being a point where one can see the reflection of Mount Machhapuchhre as well as Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges on its surface.
With water sports, fun parks, and lakeside hotels, restaurants and bars, the ambience of the lake and the vibrant attractions around it pull in people so much so that people spend the whole day or evening there.
Devi’s Fall or Davis Fall today has become one of the major attractions of Pokhara with a park. It is a waterfall with a 500-foot-long underground tunnel. The best time to visit the place is the monsoon when the water level is high.
It is also called the Patale Chhango, which means underworld waterfall. One can enjoy the view of the waterfall going underground from Gupteshwor Mahadev cave, situated across the street of Devi’s Fall. Both the landmarks are popular, separately and together.
Named after the former king Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah, the Mahendra cave is a large limestone cave in Pokhara. It is a 125-metre-long passage, attracting thousands of tourists every year. It is made from limestone, and when it falls to the ground, it forms electrical sparks. Because of this, it is also considered one of the adventurous activities to do in Pokhara.
Nearby is the Chamere (Bat) cave, as it is filled with the nocturnal mammal. Due to darkness, tourists get a torchlight to observe the bats. The exit of the cave is the one that is considered adventurous, as the gap is narrow and it boosts one’s adrenaline as they attempt to go out from there.
Among the many popular sites in Pokhara is also Sarangkot. It is a hill on the west of Pokhara with a view tower at the height of around 1600 m above sea level. Sarangkot is known for its mesmerising landscape of Pokhara, with Phewa lake, and the mountains range including peaks like Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu.
Sarangkot is one of the best paragliding locations in the world, so many tourists travel there for paragliding as well as the beautiful sunrise over the Annapurna range. One can walk or take a cab to reach the top, they can also experience the local village life on the way.
Pokhara has many thematic museums, a popular one is the International Mountain Museum. The entire place is one big exhibition of themes related to the mountains of Nepal, its history, mountain climbing, mountaineers, cultures and lifestyle of the people living in the mountains.
The museum consists of three parts, Hall of Great Himalayas, Hall of Fame, and Hall of World Mountains. It is spread across an area of 4,000 sq metres. The museum also exhibits a variety of flora and fauna that one can find in the Himalayan region of the country.
Another thematic and popular museum of Pokhara is Gurkha Memorial Museum. It was established in the memory of the brave Gurkhas and focuses on the rich history of the Gurkha warriors who were a part of the British Army and the Indian Army.
As one enters, they will be greeted by vintage pictures and coins and souvenirs from the past. On the two floors, one can see the background story of the Gurkha warriors along with their lifestyle and their journey and achievements. Along with that, one can also see the uniforms, medals–including the highest bravery medals such as Victoria Cross– and khukuris as well as other military ensembles.
The Seti Gandaki or just the Seti is a river of western Nepal. It gets the name for being white (seto) in colour. It rises from the base of the Annapurna range and flows southeast past Pokhara.
Near the Gurkha Museum, a section of the water has been redirected for people to closely look at it. There, on a bridge, one can observe the gorge, said to be 250 metres in depth.
Seti river is very famous as it is close to many holy places and is the main point of many stories of Hindu mythology such as Mahabharata. As there is swift-flowing water,  many tourists go there for adventurous rafting.
One of the 80 peace pagodas in the world, Nepal has two in Pokhara and Lumbini. ‘Shanti’ is a Nepali word meaning ‘peace’, so this stupa was built as a symbol of peace. The landmark discourages any loud noises.
The shrine is built in the Buddhist pagoda-style on the Anadu Hill. The place can be reached on a vehicle or on foot. It has become a major attraction, which holds big religious importance. Along with that, one can enjoy the beautiful scenario of the Phewa lake and Pokhara city as well as the mountains.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tourism-pokhara-major-destinations.html,travel

Resham Firiri alternatives: 6 easy Nepali songs for foreigners,"Thursday, August 19, 2021","Music has always played an important part in making the surroundings more pleasant. Whether it is singing songs during a long tour or indoor to lift the mood, there is music for every mood. Nepali songs are no different.
Music also pulls people closer together. It has, on many occasions, demonstrated that it is the most understood global language. But when a foreigner is introduced to Nepali music, they are most probably made familiar with ‘Resham Firiri’. However, Nepali music is much more than that, and there are many more easy, peppy and interesting songs to start with.
So, if you are trying to get familiar with Nepali music and also learn the language with it, here are some simple yet catchy Nepali songs you can sing.
Durga Lal Shrestha wrote this lovely, soothing song, which is performed by Ani Choying Dolma. This song’s lyrics, inspired by the philosophies of Buddhism, make it one of the most popular Nepali songs among the people here. This has reached 2.2 m views on YouTube. It is a lovely song to listen to while travelling, and the lyrics are simple and catchy.
It goes ’Phulko aankhaa maa phulai sansara, kaandako aankhaa maa kaandai sansara’ (if you are a flower, you will see the world as a flower; if you are a thorn, you will see a thorn). It simply means your perception of the world is a reflection of yourself. It repeats quite a few times so you can hum it next time you hear it.
This love song was penned and sung 25 years ago by Nabin K Bhattarai. This song is from his album Raharai Raharma, which made him a household name in Nepal almost overnight. His music video for this song was recently released and has had over 1 million views already. It is both romantic and catchy, and you might just find yourself falling in love with it.
The song says ‘Aankhaa maa timilai, pauchhu ma dherai dherai’ which means whenever he closes his eyes, he sees his lover, and finds her there forever. The song is an expression his feelings, of his love. The song further says he loves her so much that he sees her even in his dreams and wants to spend the rest of his life together. So it should be pretty easy to follow.
‘Kutu maa kutu’ is another superhit song released in 2017. This song appeared in the Nepali film Dui Rupaiya. It was written and sung by Rajan Raj Shiwakoti along with Melina Rai and Rajan Ishan, and was directed by Asim Shah.
This song became the first Nepali YouTube video to reach 100 million views on December 22, 2017, and still is the most viewed Nepali video on YouTube, with over 150 million views. This is one of the best and easiest Nepali songs to listen to when travelling or just to kill time or even dance to it because it is everywhere.
The main chorus for this song is ‘Kutu maa kutu supadi dana, kutu maa kutu’ and means supadi (betelnuts) being cracked and chewed. Kutukutu, the onomatopoeia, refers to the sound it makes. This may or may not make sense, to foreign listeners, and the lyrics might even feel fast-paced to follow. But, it is still worth it even if you learn just the chorus. The music video is also entertaining to watch.
Tulsi Gajmer wrote and composed the song ‘Asaare mahinaa maa’, inspired by Nepali migrant workers in Darjeeling, India. It was sung by Chhujang Dukpa, with Aruna Lama joining in on the chorus. It is about a male migrant worker, who is abroad for work and is remembering his family, in particular, his young son. This song was released back in 2005 and it was immediately admired by many. Its popularity was boosted by Prashant Tamang singing it on the Indian Idol (2007).
‘Asaare mahinaa maa’ refers to the third month in the Nepali calendar (June/ July) when it is monsoon season in Nepal. The song goes ‘Asaare mahinaa maa, paani paryo rujhaune, eklo yo mero man kasari bujhaune’ (it is the monsoon rain, one that can drench me, but how do I convince my lonely heart). This Nepali song has a slow tempo, is emotional, and is easy to follow.
This is an older song, but it is still popular among Nepali music fans. Chandani Shah composed the song and legendary Tara Devi provided her voice. This is one of the singer’s most popular songs, and her soothing voice in this song is highly appreciated. Although ‘Ukaali Oraali’ was released before 1990, it is still one of the popular Nepali songs of today. You can even hum it; it is sure to get you in the good books of the elder generation.
To give you a peek, the singer sings, ‘Ukaali oraali harumaa…. Jaha jaha janchhau timi, ma paila bani pachhyayi rahanchu’. It means no matter wherever her loved one goes, anywhere in the world, she will always follow him like a shadow and be together although she may not be physically present.
Another popular song is ‘Parelimaa’ from the band 1974 AD and was released in 1998. From their album Samjhi Baschhu, this Nepali song became a smashing hit when it first came out because the song was acoustic, simple and genuine. It had a simple feel to it, evoking romanticism and is still a fan favourite. There are many covers of this song you can check as well.
The song goes ‘Pareli maa lukai rakha na, angaalo maa bandhi rakha’ where the singer is expressing his love by requesting his lover to hide him in her eyes and embrace him. This song is the best one to start with because it is slow, easy and speaks about the love that is a universal language too, like music.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/easy-nepali-songs-for-foreigners.html,travel
8 adventure sports in Nepal–and ideal spots for them–that should be on your bucket list,"Tuesday, August 10, 2021","Nepal is synonymous with adventure. There is so much one can do here apart from the normal adventure activities that are promoted by tour agencies. People come here for trekking, rafting, bungee and climbing among many others but there are other adventure sports that one can do here too like zip-lining, kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing and slacklining.
But, finding the right areas for these activities can be quite tedious as there are only a few areas where these are done. Today, we bring you a list of eight major adventure sports and the locations where these can be done.
Bungee is an adventure sport that has been quite popular in Nepal ever since it was first established. The thrill people get when jumping off a suspension bridge is second to none. Initially, there was only one spot in Nepal where this could be done: The Last Resort near the Bhotekoshi gorge in Sindhupalchok.
But since then, a few more have opened. There are a few in Pokhara including the one operated by  High Grounds Adventure. Another recent one has opened in Kusma on a suspension bridge above the Kaligandaki. You can go up to these places and book your jump, but if you want a good deal, companies like Bungy Nepal Adventure, Highground Bungee Station, Bhotekosi Bungee jump, The Eco-Trek and Nepal Eco Adventure will help you out.
Rafting, like bungee, is not for the faint-hearted. The thrill and the excitement one gets on a raft going through the high rapids of Nepal’s Himalayan rivers is something that everyone should experience at least once.
The best and the quickest is the one in Trishuli river, which is quite moderate and easy. But, if you are looking for a more adventurous one, white river rafting in the Seti river is one you should not miss out on. Apart from these two, rafting in the Karnali and Bheri rivers in west Nepal is also a popular choice among adventure lovers along with the ones in the Maryangdi, Tamur and Bhotekoshi rivers.
Nepal Hiking Team, Incredible Treks, GRG’s Adventure Kayaking, White Water Nepal, Holy Sherpa Vision and Himalayan Joy Adventure are a few companies that offer rafting in Nepal.
Rock and wall climbing as an adventure sport is picking up in Nepal. While it was primarily done by people associated with mountaineering, now it is being done as recreation by many. For wall climbing, Astrek Climbing Wall, Kathmandu Sports Climbing Centre and Pasang Lhamu Climbing Centre are the ideal places in Kathmandu while one has opened in Pokhara called West Indoor Sport Hub. Climbing these walls can help one a lot when they go rock climbing in areas like Hattiban, Bimalnagar and Monjo. If you are planning a rock climbing trip, ask any of the wall climbing centres to help you out.
Nepal is a paradise for mountain bikers. Almost all trekking designations are ideal for cycling. The trails around Kathmandu are just as good, but there will be times when you will have to carry your bikes. An ideal destination for long-distance mountain biking is the Annapurna Circuit. Along with that, trails in far-western Nepal like Upper Dolpo and Khaptad can also be navigated on a bike. People have also been going to Langtang National Park on their bikes.
Ice climbing, like rock climbing, is gradually becoming popular in Nepal. Though it is mostly done by mountaineers, adventurers have also started to indulge in this. There are, however, only two places so far where this is done – Humde in Manang and Thame in Khumbu. It is preferable to contact the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) or the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association (NNMGA) before you indulge in this activity. They will sort you out with instructors and gear.
Even though this is quite recreational, there are a few areas where it can be an adventure. Hills around Gorkha, Kot Danda, Godavari, Surkhet, Phulchoki and Bandipur are ideal for these activities. But before you get there, make sure that you have experience. If not, ask for an instructor from a paragliding company based in Pokhara.
Canyoning is also picking up in Nepal and is an adventure sport for all ages, even kids. Jalbire Canyon in Chitwan is the best place to indulge in this activity. If you’re looking for somewhere close, Sundarijal near Kathmandu also has a place for this activity.
This is probably the most extreme thing anyone can do in Nepal. There are only two places designated for sky diving, Everest and Pokhara, as you get to witness a birds-eye view of the Himalayas. Everest Skydive Nepal and Pokhara Skydive are the companies you can contact if you want to go sky diving in Nepal.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/adventure-sports-destinations-in-nepal.html,travel

Kathmandu tourist buses resume services for major destinations,"Thursday, July 29, 2021","Kathmandu, July 29
Tourist bus operators in Kathmandu say they have resumed their services for major touristic destinations of the country including Pokhara and Chitwan.
Most travel and tourism activities have been halted in the country for the past one and a half years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
But, two buses for Pokhara and one for Chitwan are leaving Kathmandu daily carrying domestic and foreign tourists from last week, informs Ishwar Sharma, the president of the Nepal Tourist Bus Association. He says the numbers of buses and destinations can go up as there used to be buses for Lumbini, Janakpur and Birgunj also in the past.

Boating in Phewa lake resumes after 2.5 months,"Thursday, July 22, 2021","Pokhara, July 22
Boating in the Phewa lake, one of the most popular attractions in Nepal’s tourism capital Pokhara, has come into operation after a halt of 2.5 months owing to the Covid-19 spread.
Authorities had imposed prohibitory orders in the Pokhara metropolitan city since April 27 this year to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The resumption of boating has not only elated domestic tourists but also enthused the workers who earn their living from boating.
The Phewa Boat Entrepreneurs Committee Vice-Chair Mangal Nepali shares boating resumed in consultation and coordination with the concerned authorities. Those willing to enjoy boating services have been asked to mandatorily comply with the health safety protocols put in place to prevent the spread of the virus.
The 20-feet boat will be allowed to keep only four people while an 18-feet could allow only three people in maximum, adds vice-chair Nepali. Earlier, up to 9 people were allowed in a boat.
“Eight to nine boats are allowed in the Phewa lake once. The resumption aims at bringing respite to the boat operators and the workers in the field,” he says.
Meanwhile, the Taalbarahi temple in the middle of the lake has not been opened for the public yet. The evening worship rituals have been halted lately.
On regular days, a total of 764 boats were in operation in the lake measuring 5.726 square km in area.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/boating-in-phewa-lake-resumes-after-2-5-months.html,travel
Nepal monsoon attractions: 8 places to visit,"Saturday, July 17, 2021","The monsoon in Nepal starts in June and lasts until August every year. It is delightful; if you want to have the best of nature and the finest travelling experience in Nepal, the monsoon is best suited. There are many reasons to take a trip to Nepal in the monsoon. The sunrise and sunset in the monsoon are more spectacular and the mountains can be seen more clearly.
On the other hand, Nepal, being an agricultural country, farmers here are mostly dependent on the rainfall and harvest their crops in this season. So, during the monsoon, you will get to see farmers participating in planting rice, paddy, corn, beans, and other harvests. You will also get a glimpse of the lush green landscapes and amusing agricultural terraces of Nepal in this season.
If you are planning a trip to Nepal in and around the monsoon, here are a few places that are best to visit during this time to make your trip more enhancing:
Kathmandu valley lies in the central part of Nepal and if you arrive in Nepal by flight, you will find this city as your first destination. It is also home to seven out of 10 World Heritage Sites listed by UNESCO and they make it the best monsoon destination in Nepal.
While travelling to Kathmandu, you can get a chance to encounter diverse cultures, foods, monuments, and traditions. And, the feeling while walking the wet streets of Kathmandu is magical. Though it is a city, you can still see farmers enjoying the planting season in action in the suburbs that are less populated.
Like Kathmandu, Pokhara also comprises numerous fascinating places to travel to. With fewer pollutants, Pokhara is considered one of the most beautiful valleys in Nepal. This valley is located in the Kaski district in the western part of Nepal and is famous for having many beautiful lakes. Thus, Pokhara is also called the City of Lakes’.
The city also consists of many caves, waterfalls, rivers, hills, mountains, trek and adventurous places, and natural beauty. So naturally, the place offers you a lot to enjoy during the monsoon.
Also, three out of the 10 highest peaks in the world (Annapurna I, Dhaulagiri, and Manaslu) are just 24-56 km from Pokhara whereas amazing Mt Machhapuchhre also is even closer. After a heavy downpour of the monsoon, all of the mountains, hills, and scenarios become clearer and leave a beautiful ambience.
During the monsoon in Nepal, tourists love starting their trek early in the morning to not miss the promising sunrise and visit the other places afterwards. Some of the beautiful places in Pokhara are Phewa Lake, Shanti Stupa, Davis Fall, Sarangkot, International Mountain Museum, Gupteshwor Cave, Poon Hill, etc.
Pokhara also features adventures like mountain biking, cycling, bungee jumping, paragliding, boating, and many more. The rice planting also takes place in Pokhara during the monsoon.
Lumbini is popular in the world as the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and lies in the Rupandehi district in the western part of Nepal. Here, various monasteries are built by different Buddhist countries like Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Srilanka, France and Germany depicting different sects of Buddhism. Lumbini is also one of the World Heritage sites listed by UNESCO.
Despite being a holy place, a tourist can also enjoy the monsoon greenery of Lumbini after rainfall as it will make the sightseeing tour even more enticing. Some of the other places to visit in Lumbini are the Maya Devi temple, Eternal Peace Flame (Shanti Deep), Tilaurakot, Ashoka Pillar, Lumbini Museum, and World Peace Pagoda, etc.
With soon-to-open Gautam Buddha international airport, travelling to Lumbini will be easier.
The Upper Mustang trip is regarded as the best trip in Nepal. Here, you can see exotic cultures and more distinct people than any other part of Nepal. It used to be the ancient trade route between Nepal and Tibet. And, before 1992, tourists were restricted to enter the ancient kingdom. Being remote and distinct, this place stands out as mysterious compared to other places in Nepal.
Though Upper Mustang is considered the desert of Nepal, a trek in the monsoon is great fun. It is so because the wind in other seasons is menacing and may ruin your trek. It never rains in Mustang but the rain shadow in the monsoon makes the windless active, which eases the trip and shows the breathtaking art of nature.
The driveway to Upper Mustang is very adventurous due to hard topographical transport with the sight of amazing caves and ancient monasteries. This region preserves the Gurung and Tibetan culture and one can observe the vibrant lifestyle of Tibetan Buddhists, and rare medieval Buddhist arts and unique works of architecture.
Annapurna circuit trek is another trek in Nepal famous among tourists. On a trip to Annapurna, you encounter the view of diversifying climate, complex topography, snow-capped mountains, waterfall views, and green lush vegetation. The circuit is located in the western mountainous region of Nepal.
The Annapurna Himalayan range is closed up and you get to be in the deepest valley of the world, Kali Gandaki River valley, inhabited by Thakalis. Furthermore, you can traverse exploring other fascinating cultures, caste, and traditions. You will explore Hindu culture in the lower areas of the region and Buddhist in the upper ones.
The monsoon in the Annapurna consists of less rain but the tracks are somehow wet. So, you need to watch out for it. But, overall, your eyes will gaze at naturally rich terrain and spectacular vistas if you take this trip.
Chitwan is located 150 km southwest of the capital, Kathmandu. Since the region lies in the Terai belt of Nepal, the temperature is considerably hot there. The most famous place in Chitwan is the Chitwan National Park, a natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Besides, it also includes other attractive places like Ranipokhari, Bishazari lake, Jalbire waterfall, Shiraiculi hill, and many more.
In the jungle safari of Chitwan National Park, rhinos, musk deers, spotted deers, and monkeys are common. The park consists of 68 species of mammals and 544 variants of birds. Chitwan can engage you with activities like elephant ride and bathe, crocodile breeding centre, cultural programmes by the Tharu community, the sunset view from Narayani riverbank, and many more. Monsoon is a great season to see the peacocks dancing and animals roaming around.
Dolpa (or Dolpo) is the biggest district of Nepal located in the Himalayan region of western Nepal. Since it lies in the mountain region, the mountains like Dhaulagiri, Sisne, and Kanjirowa with the view of Phoksundo lake give a heavenly landscape during the monsoon. Being farther from the capital of Nepal, a Dolpa trip can be very adventurous due to the difficulty in transport in the remote area along with complicated geography.
Everyone who has been on a Dolpo trip has appreciated the beauty of the place and praised it as well. You can explore various cultures, ethnicities, caste, people, and fascinating places. Some of the important places of Dolpo are Charka, Mukot, Dho, Phoksundo, Tinje, Saldang, and Vijer.
Bandipur is located in the Tanahun district of western Nepal. It is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in Nepal to visit during the monsoon. The place consists of 18th-century houses turned into restaurants, with temples, and a natural view of green hills, forests, amazing valleys, and caves. Sunrises and sunsets are especially amazing during the monsoon. After a heavy downpour in the monsoon, the trekking trails of hills become a little slippery but the landscapes are visible and thus lovely.
One can also participate in adventurous sports like paragliding and hiking during the monsoon. There is also a rock climbing destination at Bimalnagar. The upper part of Bandipur especially depicts the Newa culture. Walking the streets with traditionally designed buildings and foundations gives you the joyful vibe of walking in an ancient city. Some of the important places to visit in Bandipur are namely Thani Mai Temple, Tundikhel, Sidda Gupha Cave, Bindhyabasini temple, and Khadga Devi temple.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-monsoon-attractions-places-to-visit.html,travel
"Bimalnagar: Nepal’s prime rock climbing attraction is at stake. But, stakeholders vow to save it","Tuesday, July 13, 2021","Bikash Gurung was rock climbing at Bimalnagar, Bandipur of Tanahun in April when he saw a few people with a tape measuring the distance from the Prithvi Highway to the climbing rock. Seeing people who were not climbing approach the rock, Gurung and a few of his friends, who were also climbing, got down and approached the officials.
“They told us they were a part of the road expansion team doing the measurements for a pre-feasibility study,” says Gurung.
The officials told them that as plans were in place to extend the highway from Mugling to Damauli and that as per the plan, it was likely that parts of the climbing rock would be affected during the extension.
“We were shocked when they told us that it might be gone when the road expansion takes place,” says Gurung.
This has caused an uproar within the climbing community of Nepal that feels it would be detrimental for the sport’s future in Nepal. The locals have also shown concern as the rock has had a positive impact on the community as the area, even though it is home to Siddha Cave, supposedly the second largest cave in South Asia, is known only because of the climbing rock.
“This is the area’s jewel; we will do everything we can to stop it from being demolished,” says Dhan Bahadur Thapa, ward number 4 chair of Bandipur rural municipality. “We’ve been holding talks with the centre and hopefully we might be able to find a way to save the rock.”
Various meetings, both online and in-person, have taken place as local leaders and stakeholders have been trying to explain to the authorities the need to save the rock, which for the past 15 years has been a centre of the universe for rock climbing in Nepal.
“The Chinese company building the road has promised it will try its best to save it,” says Purna Singh Thapa Magar, the chairman of Bandipur rural municipality. “There are chances that two routes might be affected, but they’ve also promised that they will build a better route if they have to demolish one.”
Magar, however, says that demolishing the routes will be the last resort as they are talking about other alternatives.
“I know what this place means to people and am all for saving it,” says Magar.
Every year, this place sees thousands of people. Some come to climb for leisure while others climb to train themselves as the wall is used by Nepal National Mountain Guide Association and Nepal Mountaineering Instructors Association to train mountain guides.
Local Lal Kumar Shrestha, who owns a guesthouse opposite the rock, says army and police personnel also use the rock for their yearly training.
“It’s a place for everyone. It has routes for beginners and for pro athletes. It would be a shame if anything happened to this. We will not let anything happen,” says Shrestha.
The rock was set up in 2006 by mountain guides Prem Gurung and friends in memory of Iman Grung, a mountaineer, instructor and adventurer who lost his life after being buried in an avalanche at Kang Garu in the Nar Phu valley in the Annapurna region. Since then, the rock has been a boon to anyone who is involved in mountaineering or adventure sport.
Its popularity rose in the 2010s after various mountaineering organisations started to train people there while a few also held competitions there. One person who took part in them was Niraj Karki, a former national champion and adventurer. Karki says it would be foolish to kill the wall which has been a climber’s paradise.
“If you ask any climber, they’ll tell you how important that place is. It’s invaluable for so many reasons and we need to do everything we can to save it,” says Karki.
The crag, according to Prem Gurung, is perfect for rock climbing as it is composed of limestone which is erosion-resistant and has durable surfaces making it easy to establish a new route on the cliff. The other reason, according to Prem, is its accessibility.
“It’s only 130 km from Kathmandu and 60 km from Pokhara,” says Prem Gurung. “There have been other walls in Kathmandu, but those aren’t as accessible as this one where tourists, climbers and adventurers can come spend a few days and leave. It was a win-win for all.”
The place has around 30 routes which have been divided into various grades. Some routes are harder than others as they are suitable for beginners to professionals. The wall is also is hope to Nepal’s first multi-pitch route.
“We use it to train ourselves before we go the mountain or to train young and upcoming climbers,” says Prem Gurung. “The place has a special place in the hearts of everyone who’ve known Iman and who’ve climbed here.”
Efforts have started from the locals and stakeholders as they have written to both the central and the provincial sports ministries, National Sports Council, Provincial Sports Council, District Administration Office, Bandipur rural municipality, the district’s sports development committee and the road expansion project.
“We’ve highlighted why this place is important in the letters we’ve written to them,” says Sujit Kandel, a member of the Bimalnagar Rock Climbing Conservation Committee. “We’ve had a positive response, but this is going to be a long battle for which we will have to be patient.”
He says that both the committee and the community understand it is a pride project and that the expansion should take place. But, Kandel adds that alternatives must be looked at before things move forward.
“It’s a pre-feasibility study and things can be amended, I’m sure. We’ve also suggested alternatives which can be taken into consideration by the road team,” says Kandel.
The recommendations include a request to reconsider expanding the area around Bimalnagar which they argue should be considered given that it is expected to affect a lot of people and organisations. The second recommendation includes shifting the highway towards the river.
“Looking back at what’s happened this monsoon, it might not be an ideal plan but they can see if that can be done,” adds Kandel.
The final recommendation they have given to the government is to make an alternative track to avoid the wall section completely.
“We hope they can consider this,” says Kandel.
Local Shrestha, on the other hand, says the authorities and the people who have been assigned the project want to target the rock and demolish it for mining.
“I’ve heard they want to mine the place for uranium and other minerals. The project is being handled by the Chinese and they’ve been telling how they want to extend the area 50 metres rather than 25 metres. If they do that, we will not stay quiet because this place means a lot to us,” says Shrestha.
However, rural municipality chair Magar says whatever Shrestha says is not entirely true as they also plan to make restaurants and other attractions near the wall.
“The Chinese have brought a plan to make the place attractive and I think the locals need to entertain some ideas,” he says.
The locals, however, do not trust the Chinese as they feel that they will do more harm than good.
“If they even think about damaging the rock, there will be retaliation,” says Shrestha.
But, for climbers like Karki, resorting to violence is not the answer as he feels that Iman’s legacy might be tarnished due to it.
“There is no alternative to Bimalnagar and that is what the major problem is right now. Authorities need to understand this because this place is historic,” says Karki. “The sad part is, if the authorities do demolish the place, people will not realise what we have lost.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rock-climbing-nepal-bimalnagar.html,travel
Palung has a lot to offer for one-day visitors from Kathmandu and around,"Saturday, July 10, 2021","The prohibitory order is much eased in the Kathmandu valley now. Many of you must have been shut inside your house, and now, you must be yearning to go out for a short trip.
As the restriction imposed on transportation is lifted now, you can fulfil your wish to travel. And, if you just have a day to visit to explore a place that is not very far from the valley, Palung in Makawanpur can be the best destination, which is about 65 km away from Kathmandu via the Tribhuvan Highway.
From lush-green vegetable fields to the exotic views of the Himalayan range, Palung offers you an earthy ambience along with cultural imprints. For short one-day visitors, here is the list of some attractions that you should not miss here:
Okhar Bazaar is a traditional Newar settlement and also is a busy marketplace in Palung. You can get to see traditional Newar houses here.

After crossing Okhar Bazaar and the Palung bridge, you get to Thana Bazaar, again on the bank of Palung Khola.  Locals believe that it got its name ‘Thana Bazaar’ from the Palung Area Police Office that has been there since 1973 as a police office or station is locally termed ‘thana’ in many parts of Nepal. Unlike Okhar Bazaar, Thana Bazaar is not a traditional Newar settlement, but still, this bazaar offers you local Newari cuisine and many more.
At the bank of Palung Khola, there lie boulders kept there aesthetically by nature for you to enjoy. It can be a perfect place to chill, listening to the relaxing sound of flowing Palung Khola. The view of the hills that surround Palung from these boulders is just spectacular. This place is picture-perfect.
Shikharkot Bazaar, which is the biggest marketplace in Palung, is just a few metres ahead of Thana Bazaar. Compared to Thana Bazaar and Okhar Bazaar, this place lies above the Palung Khola. You can also ride on autorickshaws to roam around the markets here.
More than anything, Palung is famous for the vegetables that it exports to different parts of the country including Kathmandu. The lush-green vegetable fields spread throughout the spectacular landscapes of Palung are the major attraction of this place. You can enjoy its view from the highway itself.
Daman, about 10 km away from Palung, is one of the most popular destinations among domestic tourists to experience winter snow. At the same time,  the views of the Himalayan range from Daman are just breathtaking. There are many resorts and hotels in Daman for the stay. Plus, the Daman View Tower also attracts people to this place. Shree Rikheshwar Mahadev Temple, picnic spot and park are some places you can roam around in Daman.
From Kathmandu, you can get there on your private vehicle or any public transportation. The fare is about Rs 200.
Palung lies along the Tribhuvan Highway. After travelling around 25km west of Kathmandu, you will reach Naubise and you need to take left along the Tribhuvan Highway for about three hours.

Makalu-Barun area can be an ideal destination to trek after Everest,"Saturday, June 19, 2021","Gagan Raj Neupane of Rasuwa is a tourism entrepreneur by profession and one of the directors of Rasuwa Treks and Expeditions.
“I am not just a tourism entrepreneur, but also a guide for tourists, on foot,” he says to introduce himself.
In his course of work, he has reached the Everest region along with other parts of the country. “I have travelled to the Everest region about 60 times,” he says.
“But, for the first time in my life, I travelled to the Makalu-Barun area recently, even at a time when the country was on lockdown.” As he visited the area alone, he found it had prospects to expand his business further as an alternative to the Everest region.
He reached there two weeks ago.
In mid-April, he had reached the Everest region with a foreigner. After sending them back to Kathmandu, he set out the Makalu-Barun journey from Lukla, the gateway to Everest.
“I heard a lot about Makalu-Barun, but it felt very different while travelling,” he shares. “Despite being naturally rich, the Makalu-Barun region still lags far behind the Everest region in terms of development and technology.”
Normally, he does not walk more than six hours a day when travelling with tourists, but because he was alone this time, he trekked 10 hours a day.
Because of this, he was able to complete the 10-day journey in six days and return. Probably because it was a new adventure, he did not feel like he walked 10 hours a day.
Though there is no problem regarding food and accommodation in the area, he feels that there is a lot of room for improvement for tourism development in the area. He says it got very difficult to travel because the route did not have proper signs.
Nonetheless, he adds, “Foreign tourists after trekking to the Everest region naturally think where next. I will now try to take my clients to this area.”
The Makalu-Barun National Park was established in 1992. It is named after Mount Makalu and covers an area of ​​2,330 square kilometres.
The national park stretches from the tropical forests along the Arun river to the highlands of the Himalayas. This is the highest protected area in the world at an altitude of 8,000 metres.
Within the park, there are mountains including Mount Makalu (8,463 metres), Mount Chamlang (7,319 metres), Mount Baruntse (7,129 metres) and Mera Peak (6,654 metres) among other mountains.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/makalu-barun-area-can-be-an-ideal-destination-to-trek-after-everest.html,travel
Nepal tourism industry may take 2 years to return to the pre-Covid-19 status: Govt,"Friday, June 18, 2021","Kathmandu, June 18
The government has estimated that it will take two years for the country’s tourism industry to return to its pre-Covid-19 status even if the pandemic impacts are to subside immediately.
A projection launched by the National Planning Commission says the the country could take two years to welcome as many foreign tourists as it would see regularly before the pandemic.
In the fiscal year 2019/20 (mid-July to mid-July), the country had recorded 1 million and 197,000 foreigners for tourism purposes. Although the government had announced the ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign with a mission of attracting at least two million tourists, it was called off in the third month citing the pandemic.
As the current fiscal year, 2020/21, is ending next month, the country since mid-July 2020 received around 230,000 foreigners, and it is unlikely to increase significantly. This is the lowest that Nepal recorded in the past two cades.
On top of that, the country’s apex planning body estimates the figure next year (FY 2021/22) is likely to stand at around 500,000 only. It will be more than double in the FY 2022/23 only, close to the 2019/20 mark.
Meanwhile, tourism entrepreneurs from the private sector have blamed the government for failing to present any clear plan to revive the industry after the pandemic will be over.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tourism-industry-may-take-2-years-to-return-to-the-pre-covid-19-status-govt.html,travel
7 deadliest mountain tragedies of Nepal,"Friday, June 11, 2021","Nepal’s mountaineering season is over. Even though the season was plagued by Covid-19 and two cyclones, nearly 400 people reached the top of various mountains in Nepal with five casualties. There were successful expeditions on Annapurna and Baruntse along with Everest and Lhotse while expeditions were cancelled on Makalu and Dhaulagiri due to the risk of avalanches.
Despite Tautkae and Yaas cyclones, a few teams risked it to the top while many, fearing for their and their clients’ lives, decided to call it a day and return home.
Mainly due to weather conditions, Nepal’s mountains in the past have seen some devastating disasters in the past. Avalanches and seracs collapsing led to entire teams disappearing on the mountain. While things have been better due to well-trained mountaineers and better equipment, life in the mountains is always full of risk.
Here we look back at seven major disasters that happened on the high mountains of Nepal.
The Khumbu icefall is one of the most dangerous sections on Everest. The place has taken the lives of many, both Nepali mountaineers and their support staff and foreign clients. One of the first major disasters happened at the icefall on April 5, 1970, when six Nepali mountaineers died due to an avalanche at the icefall. They were a part of the Japanese skiing expedition producing a movie called The Man Who Skied Down Everest.
Mima Norbu, Nima Dorje, Tshering Tarkey, Pasang, Kunga Norbu, and Kami Tshering died on the icefall while Kyak Tsering died a few days later after a serac fell on him.
Manaslu is normally one of the safest 8,000-metre mountains in the world. But, in 1972, it showed everyone how safety is not guaranteed in the mountains. An avalanche buried the Korean camp at 6,500 metres, killing fifteen climbers including ten Nepali mountain guides and the Korean expedition leader Kim Ho-sup, and Kazunari Yasuhisa from Japan.
Annapurna is one of the most deadly mountains in the world, according to climbers. The weather on the mountain is unpredictable; it remains cold and covered with snow through the year and the high jet streams can sweep anyone away from the face of the mountain. Annapurna I has the greatest fatality rate of all the 14 eight-thousanders. On average, three people die on the mountain for every 10 who make it to the top. In 1991, four Nepali mountain guides and two Koreans died in the mountain after an avalanche swept them away.
This is pretty well known as many books have been written about it along with a big budget IMAX film also being made on the disaster. Five climbers died on Everest on May 10 and 11 as they were caught in a blizzard while attempting to descend from the summit. That year, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest season on Everest at the time.
Notable deaths on the mountain that year were Rob Hall and Andrew Harris from Adventure Consultants, Scott Fischer from Mountain Madness and clients Dough Hansen and Yasuko Namba. Beck Weathers, who was left for death above the South Col, miraculously survived even though he suffered chronic frost bites on his limbs.
It is from this year onwards did people start raising questions about the commercialisation of Everest. It is something that is being raised even today.
An avalanche hit Camp 3 of the mountain at 7,000m, killing 11 people and injuring many. The avalanche, according to the survivors, took place as a huge piece of ice fell from a glacier above Camp 3. The ice is believed to be as big as two football fields. Most of the people who died on the mountain were French.
There were 232 foreign climbers who had been granted permission to climb Manaslu in the autumn climbing season that started in September. There were more than 150 guides and support staff with them.
This remains a dark day for the Nepal climbing community. On April 18, 2014, as many as 16 Nepali climbers died at the Khumbu icefall after a serac on the mountain’s western spur collapsed resulting in an avalanche. Out of the 16, 13 bodies were recovered from the mountain while the remaining three were never found. The entire climbing community was in shock as its members lost their friends and family members on the mountain. The situation got worse when Nepal’s government offered a small compensation to the victim’s families, causing them to stage a strike and cancel the season altogether in a way to show respect to their friends who lost their lives on the mountain.
Everest season was affected two years in a row as the earthquake caused another cancellation due to another devastating avalanche that killed 22 people on April 25, 2015. The avalanche caused by the 7.8-magnitude quake triggered an avalanche from Pumori onto the base camp on Mount Everest. With aftershocks a frequent occurrence, the season was cancelled as no one climbed Everest for the first time in 41 years.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/deadliest-mountain-tragedies-of-nepal.html,travel
Traveller’s tale: Trek to Everest base camp right before Covid-19 went there,"Tuesday, June 8, 2021","Drinking tea at a kitchen tent at Everest base camp, I could only think how lucky I was. Having walked over 50 kilometres in seven days, I had reached the base camp in perfect shape. I was not tired, nor had I shown any symptoms of mountain sickness. With a cup of tea in my hand and the Khumbu icefall in front, I was breathless. It was not because of a lack of oxygen. It was because I had made it to the foot of Everest all by myself. People had told me not to do this alone, but I listened to none even as Covid-19 was raging in India.
I went on, climbed on slowly but steadily. After two years of planning and cancellation and planning, I was at a place where everyone dreams of coming. The gateway to the top of the world, the foot of the highest peak in the world, Everest, perhaps when the deadly coronavirus was also climbing up beside me.
*Disclaimer: The trek started on April 8 and ended on April 19.
I was walking the most popular trekking trail in the world. The trail stretches around 100 kilometres if you take detours around the region. It starts at Lukla at 2,800 metres and climbs up to 5,500 metres at Kala Patthar where you get to see not only Everest but the Khumbu glacier and Mount Pumori. The base camp itself is at 5,364 metres, at the glacier itself.
Going back in time
The trek, as you go higher up, is bound to take you back in terms of time. Away from all distractions, you enter a different world. You find instances that show you how the lifestyle of the people around the high mountains have not changed even though times have. Like their ancestors, the people high up, where there are not trees, use yak dung to light up the fire. It is like going back centuries where everything was made by hands.
The trails are lovely. They are clean and wide enough. Given there are over 500 people trekking in the region every day during the peak season, the trails have been well maintained. The initial part of the trail is nice and easy as you walk along the base of hills listening to the gorging sound of the Dudhkoshi river. You cross sturdy suspension bridges over the river.
After Namche, the trail gets better as it goes up and down the hill through jungles high into the mountains around Pangboche. There is a different route you can take to Pangboche. Even though both are great, the one via Phortse is raw and not as crowded. It gives you a chance to walk alone with Tengboche to your right and Ama Dablam straight ahead.
The trail after Pangboche goes up a few hills into rocky and sandy terrain. As the trail gets higher, the terrain gets dryer and more rocky. The last stretch from Gorak Shep to basecamp is extremely sandy and rocky. People are even hinting that a few thousand years ago, all of these were sandy beaches.
Don’t think anyone can complain about the view. It starts off nice and green around Lukla to Namche, then becomes quite spectacular as you get higher up. The Himalayas are, quite simply, splendid. Every day as you go higher, the view changes and that makes this trek interesting. Small shrubs replace trees and you walk past meadow after meadow on the base of huge mountains.
One day, you are walking around green hills with Mount Khumbila behind you and you see icy rivers on the valley floors. The next day you see jagged cliffs towering in the background against a backdrop of crystalline skies. The higher you go, the better view you get, so prepare your legs to climb as high as you can.
The trail takes you through numerous villages and people with bright smiles even porters carrying up to 40 kgs on their back. Having had a tough year, these people are still smiling at everyone coming to the region. Most people who live here are from the indigenous Sherpa community, but people from other communities are also seen sporadically as they have been tasked with running the lodges around the area. While during the season, Nepalis are generally disregarded. This year, however, everyone is welcomed with open arms–apparently because the number of foreign tourists has decreased.
The tea houses in the Khumbu region are the best in Nepal. There is no doubt about this. The dining is warm as are the rooms. Locals say most of them have been improved in the past decade while a lot had been constructed in the past year for the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign.
Showers are available up to Dingboche while I am sure there are arrangements in Lobuche as well. People are also being offered electric blankets at Gorak Shep which goes to show how this area has evolved in the past two decades when people had to pitch tents in most of the trekking route. The rates of rooms vary from one place to another but are not free. The locals get agitated when you ask for free rooms, so please refrain from doing so.
The range of food on the trail is surprising. The menu shocked me. From Nepali specials to the continentals, you get it all. But, the staple is always dal-bhat although its taste as you go higher up gets worse and worse. A lodge owner specifically tells me not to order dal-bhat as they do not know how to make a good one. So, Tibetan stew and thukpa is the way forward if you want a full stomach. Tuna sandwich and pizza are also quite good. Try avoiding meat as most of it is not fresh.
Cafe 4410 at Dingboche is a must-visit where you can try a range of burgers and sandwiches along with its roasted coffee. The cafe is too nice not to go to. Lastly, ask for Seabuckthorn juice or jam where you stay. These local berries taste like apricots and are quite nice to taste.
The scenery changes for the better as I climb up. From Pangboche, the trees are gone. With it always windy, the mountains are quite clear. Ama Dablam from then on looks majestic.
As I get nearer, the mountain keeps changing its shape. Standing above Nangkarthung, a hill above Dingboche during the acclimatisation day, I can see Kangtega, Ama Dablam, Nuptse, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Taboche from the top. It is quite a scenery which proves an age-old saying, the higher you go, the better the views get.
The temperature during the night changes dramatically. The only way one can escape it is by laying yourself up and using down jackets. The rooms have no heating but have warm blankets. The wind, above 3000 metres, gets quite frosty. The wind speeds increase significantly in the afternoons. Above 4,000 metres, the still water freezes, which makes going to the toilet at night quite tough. Above 5,000 metres, the winds pick up even more. It is mostly on your back while you are going up the trek pushing you on while coming back, you get the wind straight on your face. It is uncomfortable, but worth it for the views.
I had no signs of the AMS but saw a lot of people, mostly foreigners, suffer from high altitude. The first person I saw was at Pangboche. The guy was being put on a horse to be taken to Namche and below. He looked pale and had nausea. The other was a Nepali lady at Dingboche who said she could not breathe properly. She managed to complete the trip but had to use a horse to do so. Beyond Lobuche, a lot of people were struggling. People who had not acclimatised two days at Namche Bazar and Dingboche were suffering the most. A couple from Lithuania had to take a helicopter back to Namche from Gorak Shep due to altitude sickness.
That is why, if you are from a lower altitude, it is better to take altitude medicines before you leave for the trek. Mind you, if you take medicines, make sure to have plenty of water.
They are everywhere. At Lukla, at Phakding, at Namche, at Pheriche, you name a place, they send a helicopter. They transport both people and goods and do so from 6 am to 6 pm. There are days you see them more than you see birds. As long as it has helped locals, for a trekker, the noise of these helicopters is annoying. If it is for rescue understandable, but mostly, it is for the convenience of people who own helicopter companies it seems.
Dingboche has to be one of the best places in the area. Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the village in the valley is warmer than others around and is quite scenic. Ama Dablam looks spectacular from almost all parts of the village as does Taboche. Far away, you see Island Peak and other mountains which will make you want to stay there for days. As you spend two days here, there are a lot of short hikes you can take which includes going halfway to Ama Dablam base camp.
Lobuche is also quite nice as you get a close view of the Khumbu glacier. But, the best place on the trek has to be Tengboche. The small village on top of the hill is a little paradise from where you get to see a panoramic view of Everest, Ama Dablam among many other mountains. It houses a 15th-century monastery which is the leading Buddhist centre in the Khumbu region with a residing Rinpoche who blesses pilgrims, mountaineers and travellers passing through. A trek up to his little paradise is completely worth it.
Namche has to be the most overrated place in the region. It is a party place. It is busy, full of loges and shops. Even though people are recommended to stay two nights here, there is basically nothing to do besides drinking and hiking up to Syangboche and Khumjung. The view of Kongde Peak is quite nice though, but apart from that, there is nothing Namche offers. It is not an authentic Sherpa village. It is a trap to loot money from foreigners. The alternative to this is to hike up Khunde which is a better place if you like solitude.
The camp is busy. Expedition agencies are busy making the base camp ready for their clients. It looks packed from a distance and as I near it, it is still busy. Tents have been pitched everywhere.
The support staff are busy flattening out a part of the glaciers to ensure that they could pitch the tent in an easy manner. Tumbling and tripping on rocks, I navigate the area as if I belong there. But I do not. People are not allowed in for a long time, and realising that, I wish those I know the best of luck and return to Gorak Shep.
The stone that marks the base camp changes its place every year. Like every other year, there are a lot of people heading to the stone from Gorak Shep. It is a two-hour walk through rocky terrain which also changes every year, say locals. But surrounded by mountains, you feel that you are somewhere else. In a place far far away. Up in the mountains just below Nuptse to my right and Pumori to my left. Definitely, a place to get to one in a lifetime.
If you do not know that you do not see Everest from Everest base camp, you need to do more research. The first view you get is from Toph Dada as you approach Namche. The second is from Everest View Hotel above Namche. Then on, you get to see glimpses of it on the way to Tengboche and from Tengboche itself. But, you do not go on this trek just for Everest, you take on the trek for more. There are other great mountains around, which are better than Everest and will be in your memory for years to come.
Many call the Namche uphill the hardest on the trail, but I think that uphill is a bit overrated. It is mostly straightforward and quite a long climb. But, that hardest has to be the uphill that takes you from Thukla to Lobuche passing the mountain’s base camp in the process. It does not look much, but the uphill which takes you over 5,000 metres is gruelling and takes a lot out of you. It is only roughly an hour’s climb, but make no mistake, a lot of people give up here. No wonder they call it the Thukla Pass. It is not as easy as people think it is, but with small steps, you get there. Once at the top, you see hundreds of chhortens (small temple-like structures) made in the name of climbers who perished on Everest: from Babu Chhiri Sherpa to Scott Fisher, everyone is there reminding you of the consequences.
After Thukla, the air gets thinner. Sleeping in Lobuche and Gorak Shep is hard. I was fine at Lobuche, but in Gorak Shep I hardly slept. The lack of oxygen in the room woke me up consistently. It is a reminder that you are high up in the mountains where you do n’o necessarily belong.
It is time to address the elephant in the room. How safe is it, many might ask. Well, it was safe until the first week of April. People were doing fine. There were sanitisers in most lodges, but the use of masks was limited to only a few people. But given there were only a few 100 people on the trail, it felt particularly safe. But people at the base camp were worried. Shaking hands was not common.
Returning to Lukla is a sad feeling. As much as I love staying high up, I know that bad weather is incoming and I have to go back.
I walked 21 kilometres to Tengboche from Gorak Shep and I am glad I did as Tengboche the next morning was covered in snow. I did not see Everest from there, but I did not need to. It is not always about the high mountains, it is about experiencing something new every time. I could see the trail I took from Phortse to Pangboche covered in snow. I could see Ama Dablam playing hide and seek behind dark clouds. I was done with my trek and I loved every bit of it.
Lukla is a nice place if you get to spend a bit more time there, far better than Namche. The airport is daunting but safe. The flight is, well, nerve-wracking to say the least. Tara Air needs new aircraft because the ones it has now are definitely too old. A foreigner compared the aircraft to one of Kathmandu’s local buses. But, like the local buses, the aircraft does its job. Smoothly with little turbulence, it helps me get to where I have always wanted to go.

14 must-visit Buddhist shrines in Nepal,"Wednesday, May 26, 2021","To end all human suffering and for the better mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing of human beings, Gautam Buddha, the Light of Asia, preached a path towards enlightenment. As a testament to Buddha’s teachings, there exist many shrines such as monasteries and vihars in Nepal, the country where Buddha was born over two and a half millenniums ago.
Visiting such places can guide one to a spiritual and religious awakening process; if not, they are still the perfect sites to experience the peaceful and quiet surrounding. Some of the key Buddhist shrines in Nepal are introduced below.
Siddhartha Gautam (Gautam Buddha) was born in 623 BC in Lumbini. Hence, it is regarded as the most important place in Buddhism, and among Buddhist devotees in the world. It is an ultimate place with religious and historical importance. About 1.5 million people annually visit this place.
Lumbini, located in the Rupandehi district of Lumbini province, is also a World Heritage site which consists of Mayadevi Temple, Ashoka Pillar, as well as various monasteries made by the government of foreign countries as its attractions.
There are Royal Thai Buddhist Monastery, Myanmar Golden Monastery, Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery, and Vietnam Phat Quoc Tu Temple are some of the renowned monasteries constructed and still managed by the governments of respected countries to date, paying tribute to Lord Buddha. Here, one can enjoy the architecture style, history, and traditional Buddhist practices of various nations in one area.
When it comes to Buddhist shrines, Swayambhu Stupa is one of the most popular and important sites.
Legend has it that when the Kathmandu valley was a lake, Swayambhu Jyoti (light) was born out of a lotus flower that had bloomed in the middle of the lake. In fact, Swayambhu means the “self-existing” one. This stupa is located at the top of the hill in west Kathmandu.
Built by King Manadeva in 460, the stupa is regarded as one of the oldest, ancient religious heritage sites in Nepal. The Swayambhu complex is also a World Heritage site and is filled with beautiful chaityas, statues and shrines of Buddhist as well as Hindu deities. Visitors are also attracted to this holy site for the panoramic, beautiful scenario of Kathmandu city.
Another important Buddhist shrine and one among the World Heritage sites is Bouddha. It is popular among devotees and youth alike, who can be seen frequenting the site.
Located in the northeastern part of Kathmandu, the stupa is believed to be built in the 14th century by a Lichhavi king. The location is also believed to lie in the ancient trade route from Tibet to enter the Kathmandu valley. The stupa is also called Chorten Chenpo which translates as the great stupa. Inside the stupa is the relics of Kassapa Buddha, which is one of the 29 names of Buddha.
The symbolic construction made in the mandala style serves as the three-dimensional reminder of Buddha’s path towards enlightenment. The two eyes on each side of the stupa are also known as the wisdom eyes, and the question mark-like nose symbolises unity and the ultimate way to reach enlightenment. The 13 levels of the spire represent the stages one must clear in order to achieve nirvana. Around the base of the shrine are prayer wheels which are said to remove the negative energy and purify human karma.
Ramgram is an auspicious, very important place for Buddhists. This stupa is located in a place named after the stupa, Ramgram town of Nawalparasi district.
After Gautam Buddha left his physical world in Kushinagar of India, it is said the relics of the Buddha were divided into eight parts, and one of them is hidden inside the Ramgram Stupa.
It is also said that Emperor Ashoka once decided to take all eight relics and relocate them into thousands of pieces and enumerate them all over India. Emperor Ashoka was successful in opening seven of the stupas, but he failed to open the last one at Ramgram as the stupa was guarded by the serpent kings. So, it is said Ramgram is the only stupa that still has the holy relics of Gautam Buddha inside. With this, Ramgram became one of the important holy Buddhist pilgrimage centres to date.
Namo Buddha is another site highly regarded as a holy place, a pilgrimage site that is respected by all the devotees. It has also become a destination for a small hike for some people. It lies some 40 km east of Kathmandu, in Kavrepalanchok.
There is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery named Thrangu Tashi Yangtse founded there by the 9th Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche in the 20th century. There exists a stupa that is believed to have the remains of a prince, an incarnation of Buddha, stored. It is said that the prince went to heaven and later on reincarnated as the Siddhartha Gautam in Lumbini.
The story goes way back to the time of King Maharath who had three sons. Once the princes were enjoying themselves in a forest. Suddenly, they spotted a thin and weak tigress with her cubs. The third prince was concerned and questioned his big brothers about the reason why the tigress was weak. As the elder brother replied that was due to the scarcity of food, they left that area. But, without the knowledge of his elder brothers, the third prince went back and fed himself to the tiger. The story has been sculptured at the top of the hill.
Tilaurakot is the ancient capital of Kapilvastu where the beautiful palace of the Shakya King Suddhodhana (father of Gautam Buddha) once existed. It is the place where Siddhartha Gautam spent his first 29 years as a prince. After that, he left his newborn son Rahul, his wife Yashodhara, his family, his kingdom and departed in the search of the cause for the human sufferings, and went through the path of enlightenment.
It is said that between the third and ninth centuries AD, two Chinese monks Faxian and Xuanzang were the first pilgrims to visit Tilaurakot. Later on, through various research and tracing the path of the two Chinese monks, PC Mukherji discovered Tilaurakot in 1899.
Now, one can see the remains of the palace inside the compound of Tilaurakot, along with the two stupas, Kanthaka Stupa and the Northern Twin Stupas. The Kanthaka Stupa was made with the remains of the Buddha’s horse named Kanthaka. And, the Northern Twin Stupas were made to commemorate the parents of Gautam Buddha, King Suddhodana and Queen Mayadevi.
Seto Gumba is another famous Buddhist monastery, located at the top of a hill in northwestern Kathmandu. Seto Gumba or White Monastery is also known as Druk Amitabha Mountain. The monastery is a wonderful art of Tibetan architecture filled with various murals, statues and paintings.
After an earthquake in April 2015, the monastery was in maintenance for a few years. Now, it is finally open to the public every Sunday. One can visit the monastery as a part of a small hike or a ride as well. This gumba at the height of 1,500 m is also regarded as the second beautiful spot to view the sunrise and sunset, after Nagarkot. The beauty of the architecture of the Seto Gumba allows one to snap beautiful pictures as well as learn about Buddhism, meditation and Tibetan architecture in the monastery.
The first Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal was established at the Chhairo Monastery. Out of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Nyingma is the oldest one founded by Vajrayana preacher Guru Padmasambhava. It is located in Upper Mustang of Nepal.
This monastery was built by Chhawang Thinlen (a Thak resident who migrated from Gyirong county) during the 16th century in the Chhairo village of Mustang.
Chhairo Gompa got its roots from the Northern Treasure or teachings taught at three Nyingma Mother Monasteries in Tibet, which was later flourished by the second incarnation of Chhawang Thinlen. Another disciple who has successfully advertised the name Chhairo Gompa across the globe is none other than Lama Shashi Dhoj Tualachan, a world-renowned Thangka painter.
This may be the monastery located at the highest altitude (4,200 m) in the world. Shey Gompa is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery of a two-storey building situated in the heart of the divine inner Dolpo valley. This monastery was built during the 11th century with the instruction of king Deldan Namgyal, in the memory of his late father, Sengge Namgyal.
Shey Gompa is remembered for its giant copper along with a 12-metre tall breezed golden statue of Shakyamuni (Gautam) Buddha which covers three floors of the monastery. It lies in the trekking route to cross Kanga La pass (5,151 m), which is among the highest passes in the Himalayas, from where one can see the mesmerising beauty of the mountains and panoramic landscapes.
In Matepani, Kundahar of Pokhara, Kaski district, there is a Theravada Buddhist monastery also named Matepani Gumba. It was built by the Nyeshang community (people migrated from Manang to Pokhara) in 1960. This gumba is located on the peak of a green hill mountain and its interior is decorated with bright murals depicting the stories from Buddha’s life and myths related to various deities.
It is said that in 1959, Lama Jigme went to Sikkim with his followers to consult the 16th Gyala Karmapa, Ranjung Rigpe Dorje, about the Nyeshang community in Nepal. As suggested, Lama Jigme built a monastery in Matepani. It is believed that the monastery will bring good fortune to all the upcoming generations.
In the present time, many people, devotees go to the gumba to worship as well as for the amazing view of the Pokhara city and the beautiful mountains.
Kapan Gumba is Tibetan Buddhist monastery, located in Kapan, on the northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu valley. In 1969, the monastery was created by Lama Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, founders of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition.
This monastery has been preserving the Mahayana teachings of Buddha. Kapan Gumba had also become a popular recreational destination for the local people and the tourists although it is closed for visits these days. This gumba is especially known for teaching Buddhism to Westerners visiting in the gumba along with the meditation practices.
Hidden deep in the mountains, the Rinchenling monastery is an ancient Tibetan Buddhist monastery, situated in Limi valley of Humla district near the Tibet border at an elevation of 3,500 m. Established in the 10th century, this monastery contains a four-fold image of Vairochana surrounded on its three sides by the statues of Bodhisattvas.
The Rinchenling Monastery was built by Rinchen Zangpo. Originally, Rinchen Zangpo was from China, who served as the principal translator of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit language into the Tibetan language.
This monastery is open to the public and it can be visited during the Humla Limi Valley trek along with amazing scenery of Himalayas such as Saipal, Api and Gorakh Himalayan range. Even rare animals such as blue sheep, wild ass musk deer, Himalayan black bear and snow leopard can be seen.
On the northern side of the famous Muktinath temple lies the Narsingh Buddhist monastery. This monastery was made from stone and mud masonry in Bar Agung Mukti Chhetra, in the Mustang district during the 6th century. Among the locals, the monastery is also known as the temple of 1,000 lamps.
The Narsingh monastery is also famous among the Hindus also who consider the deity as the Narasimha (half-human half-lion) avatar of Vishnu. One can visit the monastery to know the rich history of this monastery as well as to see the statue of Guru Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) and his friends, the Tibetan tantric deities Dag Po on the right and Seng Dong on the left.
Tengboche Monastery lies in the Tengboche village of the Khumbu region in eastern Nepal. Around 350 years back, with his divine power, Sangwa Dorje (a high priest) of Khumbu had envisioned Tengboche to be a religious site where there would be an important monastery. But, Tengboche Monastery was built only by Chatang Chotar, known as Lama Gulu, and the fifth incarnation of Lama Sangwa Dorje from Khumjung in 1923.
At present, Tengboche Monastery has become one of the important religious sites in Sherpa culture. Around 35 monks reside within its walls. A Tibetan Buddhist monastery at the height of 3,867 metres with a clear view of Mt Everest, this is locally known as Dawa Choling Gompa.
This monastery lies within the Sagarmatha National Park, filled with panoramic views of huge snow-clad mountains such as Tawache, Everest, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Nuptse and Thamserku. Tengboche monastery also serves as the end line of the Sacred Sites Trail Project of Sagarmatha National Park which pulls large numbers of tourists coming for trekking and mountaineering.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/must-visit-buddhist-shrines-in-nepal.html,travel
"They spent years serving Everest climbers. This time, they climbed the highest peak on their own","Monday, May 24, 2021","Phurba Sherpa and Keshav Prasad (Sobit) Gauchan have been to the Everest Region over a thousand times. While Sherpa, who is one of the directors at Heli Everest, frequented the area to look at the possibility to expand the business, Gauchan, who is a helicopter pilot, flew in and out of the region with mountaineers and tourists.
But on May 11, the two did something they had always dreamed of. The duo, along with the Bahrain Everest team, reached the summit of Everest becoming the first commercial climbers to do so in the season. Gauchan also claims he could be the first helicopter pilot to have scaled the highest peak of the world.
“I’m an avid trekker and have always been fascinated with the Himalayas,” says Sherpa. “I always dreamt about climbing Everest but to be honest I didn’t have the courage to do so. This year I mustered up the courage and thankfully reached the top of the world.”
Gauchan, on the other hand, had always been fascinated by Everest. Having flown to the base camp and higher camps, the summit of Everest always pulled him.
“I’ve flown close to the summit multiple times,” says Gauchan. “I can’t tell you how proud and happy I am to have done something I have always wanted. Truly a dream come true.”
Gauchan says that his thirst to climbing began after hearing stories from climbers who summited mountains in Nepal.
“Maybe it was curiosity that took me to the mountain,” says Gauchan.
It is not that he did not have doubts. While climbing upwards from camp 3, he says he kept on questioning why he had come there. But, putting the doubts aside, he kept on climbing until he reached the top.
Both Sherpa and Gauchan say that climbing with Seven Summit Treks and their experienced guides helped them stay calm even at the death zone.
“We had Guinness Book record holder Tashi Sherpa (also a director at Heli Everest) with us. When we were going upwards from camp 3 during the night, we were scared as it was mostly uphill. But, he kept our hopes up and encouraged us throughout the trip,” says Gauchan.
The hardest part of the climb, according to Phurba Sherpa, was the section beyond camp 3.
“I had a hard time near the south summit. It was dark and we had walked a lot that day,” he says. “But, when we reached 8,500 metres, the sun appeared beyond the mountains and when I looked down, all the mountains were below me. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.”
Both say that when daylight struck, and they got to witness the view of the surrounding mountains, all their pain washed away. The summit, they say, was heavenly. Surrounded by mountains, they were speechless. Spending some time at the summit taking pictures and taking it all in, the duo started their descent.
“Getting down was harder than going up,” shares Gauchan. “While we were climbing up, it was dark and we didn’t really see how steep it was. But, while coming down, the steep slopes were quite scary. But we didn’t have the option to stay up and came down gradually.”
Managing Director of Heli Everest Fur Gelje (Phurba) Sherpa says that he would like to congratulate all three for summiting Everest. He says that even though Heli Everest has been taking clients up and down the region, this year was special as three of the company’s directors reached the top of the world.
“Sobit (another name of Keshav) might just be Nepal’s first-ever pilot to have reached the top of the world. This is a proud moment for all of us,” says Fur Gelje.

Mera Peak is suitable for ski mountaineering: Study,"Sunday, May 23, 2021","Kathmandu, May 23
A feasibility study conducted by a team of four mountaineers, two foreigners and two Nepalis, has concluded that Mera Peak is a suitable destination for ski mountaineering.
The study team found out the 6,473-metre high peak was apt for ski mountaineering. Leonardo Bernard and Deidrick Bhan Reason from the Netherlands had skied from the summit of the peak in May, according to the Ski and Snowboarding Academy.
The skier duo had skied to the base camp of the Mera Peak within half an hour, shares Academy’s President Utsav Pathak.
The academy in collaboration with the Snow Guide Nepal Treks and Expedition conducted the feasibility study and the ski mountaineering activity on the peak. The training for ski mountaineering will be conducted on Mera Peak from coming October to train Nepal’s team to compete in the Olympic Ski Mountaineering to be held in Italy in 2026.
A ski completion was organised by the academy in Kalinchok in 2019 winter and ski mountaineering activities and training were organised on other peaks in Humla, Dolpa, Mustang and Kaski for five years.
The academy aims to popularise ski mountaineering in the country that houses eight among 14 highest mountains including 8,848.86-metre high Sagarmatha (Mt Everest).",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mera-peak-is-suitable-for-ski-mountaineering-study.html,travel

Nepal festival calendar: 15 major festivals of Nepal in 12 months every year,"Saturday, May 1, 2021","Nepal houses diverse religious and ethnic groups with different cultural festivals throughout the year. Regardless of the cultural differences and different religious and traditional beliefs, in these festivals, people gather to celebrate them together with fervour and zest.
There are numerous festivals celebrated in Nepal, but only some are considered more important. So, here are some of Nepal’s most important festivals.
Buddha Jayanti commemorates the birth of the Lord Buddha, which occurs during the night of the full moon in the first month of the Nepali calendar. This year, it falls on May 26.  The auspicious day started being celebrated around 543 BC and, every year after that, Buddhist devotees flock to Lumbini, to pay their respects to Buddha’s life and teachings.
People, especially women, visit viharas to observe the Buddhist sutras with standard all-white attire and avoiding non-vegetarian food. Devotees eat kheer (a sweet rice porridge), recite stories of Buddha, and make donations.
In a country where a major part of the population is still dependent on agriculture, the monsoon itself also marks a festival for farmers. The 15th day in the month of Asar (or Aashadh), popularly called Asar 15, is being celebrated as an agricultural festival for centuries. Few years ago, the government endorsed the tradition and decided to celebrate it as Ropain Diwas or Dhan Diwas (National Rice Plantation Day or National Paddy Day).
This is completely a farming festival, celebrated every year. It falls on June 29, 2021, next.
Ropain Diwas has a strong relationship with people in almost all parts of the country and also impacts their cultural and economic life. Even non-families also gather together to enjoy the traditional delicacy of dahi-chiura (yoghurt and beaten rice).
This is the first day of the fourth month of the Nepali calendar, which next falls on July 16, 2021. This festival holds significance in rural Nepal as people observe a unique Luto Phalne tradition.
The whole family gathers on the yard, outside the house, ignite small pieces of firewood and throw them on all sides—wishing the family would not catch luto (scabies) throughout the year.
In urban Nepal, however, the tradition of throwing away lighted fire wishing good health is not as vibrant as it used to be in villages. As the young people of the village are in cities or abroad, the tradition is dying out gradually.
Janai Purnima is a major festival for Brahmin and Chhetri communities following Hinduism in Nepal. On the full moon day of the fourth month of the Nepali calendar (August/September), men wear a sacred thread known as janai whereas both men and women wear a sacred wristband also known as raksha bandhan. (The festival itself is also known as Raksha Bandhan.)
On this day, people visit various holy sites. Among them, the Gosainkunda trek is more interesting for outsiders.
The festival will be celebrated on August 22 this year.
Gai Jatra is a traditional festival that takes place in August/September, exactly one day after Janai Purnima. It is one of the major festivals of the Newa community of Kathmandu valley; nonetheless, the festival exists throughout the country.
On this day, people roam around the city dressed as a cow in fancy clothes or walk together with a cow with photos of their lost ones.
The festival is a celebration dedicated to families who lost loved ones throughout the year. They share sorrows but also feel comfort in knowing that their lost ones are safe in their afterlife.
It is also common for people to cross-dress, and for the LGBTQIA+ community to parade in the city.
The festival will be celebrated on August 23 this year.
According to myths, Lord Krishna was born on the eighth day of the waning moon of August. The deity has special importance in the Hindu religion and a key role in the Bhagwad Geeta, as a mentor to Arjuna. The day will be observed on August 30 this year.
On this day, devotees flock to the Krishna Mandir in Patan to celebrate the festival. Men and women visit this temple to sit in vigil, waiting for midnight to arrive. They light butter/oil lamps as a sign of felicitation and devotion to the lord. Some religious groups also carry Lord Krishna’s images in a procession, accompanied by jubilant crowds and musical bands, throughout the city.
Teej is a major religious celebration that is observed mostly by women of the Nepali Hindu community. It is a fasting festival during which women pray for marital happiness, the health of their spouse and children, and the purification of their own body and soul. This festival occurs in August/September; this year, it is on September 9.
Women gather and enjoy music along with dances with their friends and families during this celebration. They also exchange gifts such as tika, bracelets, etc. On the eve, they also gather to have dar, a special kind of dish that is eaten by women to prepare for the fast.
Indra Jatra is Kathmandu’s largest religious street festivals in Nepal. This eight-day festival is mostly celebrated by the Newa communities and is referred to as Yen Ya (festival of Kathmandu). The festival honours the Hindu god of rain and heaven, Indra.
However, Indra Jatra is a festival celebrated by both Hindus and Buddhists devotees. The festivities are focused mostly on Basantapur or Kathmandu Durbar Square area.
The festival is also called Kumari Jatra where chariots of living gods Ganesh and Bhairav, as well as goddess Kumari, are pulled around the city. On this day, goddess Kumari steps out of Kumari Ghar, her residence in the square. The chariots are taken out from Basantapur to different parts of the town for people to get a glimpse of the festival. It starts on September 19 this year.
Dashain is the biggest and most important Hindu festival in Nepal. The festival commemorates the victory of good over evil and the nine forms of Goddess Durga. Dashain is observed for ten days, starting on October 7 this year.
It is also known as Bijaya/Vijaya Dashami or Bada Dashain. The festival celebrates the day when Lord Ram won over Ravana.
It is also the time for people to visit friends and family for a get-together and share a meal. People dress in new clothes and accept tika on their forehead and jamara from the hands of their elders.
Tihar is Nepal’s second most popular festival and is also called the festival of lights and colours. It starts on November 3 this year.
Tihar is a Hindu festival dedicated to many Hindu gods and goddesses, including Laxmi, Yamaraj and Yamuna.
It is observed for five days in total. The first day is devoted to crows (the death god Yamaraj’s messenger), and the second day to dogs (for their loyalty and protection). The festival is also dedicated to Goddess Laxmi and to the bond between brothers and sisters (Bhaitika). The Newa community also celebrates Mha Puja and their new year, on the fourth day.
On this day of worshipping the sun god, thousands of pilgrims flock to the holy town of Janakpur and mark the day. People visit this southeastern side of Nepal to reach the Janaki temple and take ceremonial baths in the rivers and ponds. The day this year is on November 10.
The devotees light candles, sing songs, and spend the night before Chhath Parva on the banks of rivers and ponds. They pray to the sun for safety from skin diseases.
On the day, people prepare a special dish known as thekuwa.
On the first day of Magh (the next is January 15, 2022), people observe Maghe Sankranti. It is observed as the beginning of the auspicious month of Magh in Nepal. The festival aims to signal the end of the winter season and the arrival of spring. On the day, people wish for better health and fortune.
Hindus celebrate this festival by taking a ceremonial dip in holy river confluences such as the one in Devghat, Chitwan. During the day, families get together and share meals including sesame seed laddus, molasses, ghee, sweet potatoes, and yam. During the entire Magh month, devotees worship Lord Vishnu by performing pujas and reading the holy Bhagwad Gita.
Mahashivaratri is a Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva that takes place in February/ March. The next Mahashivarati festival is on March 1, 2022.
Tens of thousands of pilgrims visit Kathmandu and reach the Pashupatinath temple for a huge celebration. They reach the holy site on the eve and chant holy scriptures. Those who cannot make it to Kathmandu visit nearby Shiva temples that are across the country.
It holds great importance in the Hindu community.
Phagu Purnima is a Hindu festival held on the full moon day in the month of Phalgun during the spring season, from February/May. The festival will be celebrated next on March 17, 2022.
Arguably, it is one of Nepal’s most famous festivals among foreigners filled as it is filled with vibrant colours, friendship, and love. As a sign of appreciation, people gather and put colours on each other. It is celebrated for two days throughout the country with the people of Nepal’s Terai region celebrating Holi the day after Kathmanduites do.
Chaite Dashain occurs in the Nepali calendar’s final month, Chaitra. Goddess Durga is worshipped on Chaite Dashain day, and animal sacrifices are performed in some temples, especially those dedicated to Durga Bhawani.
In Nepal, this festival is observed nationally and people enjoy spending time with their families and friends, eat healthy food and invite their loved ones and friends to the feast.
On the next day, Ram Nawami is also celebrated when people observe a fast and visit Lord Ram’s temples. The next Chaite Dashain falls on April 9, 2022, and Ram Nawami on April 10.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-festival-calendar-major-festivals.html,travel
Everest 2021: Climbing push to begin next week,"Friday, April 30, 2021","Kathmandu, April 30
The government of Nepal says the climbing push towards the peak of Mount Everest will begin next week.
The Department of Tourism says the latest weather forecasts have shown the period between May 1 and 9 as appropriate weather condition for climbing.
“You can expect some good news from Everest next week,” the department’s Mountaineering Director Mira Acharya says.
The department so far has issued Everest climbing permits to 408 members of 43 expeditions for this season. The number of aspiring Everest climbers this season is the highest recorded in a season so far.

Covid-19 on Everest: Nepal’s mountaineering authority issues crowd control rule. Here’s what official says about it,"Sunday, April 25, 2021","Nepal’s Department of Tourism on April 21 released a new directive which has set a climber quota to prevent crowds on Everest. The directive states that mountaineers, selected on the basis of their climbing permit numbers, would be allowed to make attempts at the summit during the first weather window. The decision was made as the numbers of permits for Everest is soon to reach 400.
The directive comes at a time when there are reports of cases of Covid-19 at the Everest Base Camp although the department has dismissed it. Nonetheless, the officials say they are worried about the safety of the climbers and working hard to prevent the further spread of the infection.
The directive, however, has been labelled pointless as a lot of expedition agencies say that it just cannot be implemented on the mountain. However, Mira Acharya, a director at the Department of Tourism, says that the rules are in place to manage the mountain and help reduce crowd. In an interview with Onlinekhabar, she also speaks about an alternative to the quota system and how the department is doing its best with limited resources.
Excerpts:
What is the motive behind this new directive?
It is a plan to stop people from crowding the mountain. Based on past data, we have decided that only a set number of people should be allowed on the mountain. We have given the first right to climbing to the teams that have got their permits first and have acclimatised accordingly. Permits 6 to 38 have the first shot in the first weather window. Every year, there are over 300 climbers on Everest and not all push to the summit at the same time. We are trying out this new rule for the climber’s safety.
But, the new directive has come out a bit late. Why was it the case? Will not it affect the planning?
How can you call it late when ropes are just being fixed and climbers have not even gone up to Camp 1? I feel that this has been taken wrongly. This decision wasn’t made solely by me; it was made after discussion with all parties involved including the Expedition Operator’s Association Nepal (EOA) to ensure a safe mountaineering system.
We want it to be first-come-first-serve because it’s only fair that those who have received their permits first should be the first on the mountain. This is the fair thing to do. Apart from this, we have also given them an alternative.
What alternative?
If this quota system is not applicable, the expedition agencies have the freedom to make decisions based on the conditions. We at the department know, on the mountain, things cannot go as planned, which is why we have said that a total number of 150-170 climbers can go up the mountain in one push. This is based on past data. The expedition companies can coordinate among themselves and determine who goes up the mountain. We have not made the rule rigid. It’s flexible. But, as I said, we want people to be safe.
How will you monitor this? Will it not be hard?
We have liaison officers on the mountain along with other officials. Again, this is not a hard-and-fast rule. We talk to people at the base camp on a regular basis. Apart from that, our law gives permission to the expedition agencies to monitor what happens on the mountain. After all, they are integral to a successful mountaineering season. We have to work together, all of us, the government, the climbers and the expedition agencies if we want a successful season amidst a pandemic.
Is this rule to stop traffic jams on Everest?
I don’t like the word ‘traffic jam’. I don’t believe there are traffic jams in the mountains. The photos you see every year are from a section that is narrow, a bottleneck of sorts, so it is bound to have people regardless of how many are there. We are aware of that and as I have said before, we want to manage the mountain and the season in a better manner. That’s what this rule is for.
The department has handed out nearly 400 permits this year. Could it not limit the number of permits to ensure that people don’t clog up the mountain?
If there was a law to do that, we would have done it a while ago. We have held talks regarding that, but with no law, limiting the number of climbers is going to be tough.
I am sure if we did that, people would be criticising the decision anyway. Expedition agencies would be crying that we took such a decision. For now, we have no plans on limiting the number of climbers.
People in the industry complain that liaison officers don’t make it to the mountain. Cannot the department set up an office at the base camp or at Gorak Shep to monitor things?
Ideally, that would be good. But again, the law does not give us the freedom to do that. Apart from that, the number of people in the department is low. We have less than 30 staff members and this makes it hard. People often criticise the liaison officers, but I feel that it is uncalled for. They and the department are doing our best when it comes to managing and monitoring things on the mountain. But I know, things can be better. We just need favourable laws.
According to permits, it is the Royal Bahrain Guard who will get the first shot on the mountain. People are talking that this rule has been brought for them so that they get the first shot on the mountain. Any comments to those people?
This claim is laughable. We are not biased towards anyone. We don’t do favours. We’re a government body working to protect mountain integrity in Nepal. Had they been the last to take the permit and we had said the last will go first, it would have been so, but it is not the case. The rules are in place for all and have been in place to manage crowds on the mountain and save lives.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mira-acharya-interview-covid-19-everest-rules-nepal.html,travel
Nepal says Covid-19 at Everest Base Camp ‘not confirmed’,"Friday, April 23, 2021","Kathmandu, April 23
The government of Nepal says reports of the coronavirus infection at the Everest Base Camp have not been confirmed by the government yet.
Hours after the BBC reported that Norwegian climber Erlend Ness told the British media that he “was isolated in hospital for eight nights due to the virus”, Nepal’s Department of Tourism Chief Rudra Singh Tamang informed Onlinekhabar that hospital reports that he obtained did not confirm the infection.
“Our reports mention he had pneumonia although he had Covid-19 symptoms,” Tamang said.
“The patient has been discharged from the hospital already and he does not have any symptom,” he said, adding the department had tested the climber’s guide also for the virus, and he tested negative.
Nonetheless, Tamang also admitted the risk of pandemic spread at the base camp is high due to the high number of climbers.
“If the virus spreads there, we might face a situation that we cannot control,” he said, “We, hence, have already asked them to maintain high levels of alert.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-says-covid-19-at-everest-base-camp-not-confirmed.html,travel

For beginners: 7 easy trekking routes in Nepal,"Wednesday, April 14, 2021","A lot of people get intimidated when they hear the word ‘trekking’. Many feel that it is just not worth it. The thought of walking for days away from home out in the wild is something they cannot fathom. But, there are some really easy routes in Nepal that be ideal for people who have never trekked, especially during the spring when the weather is just perfect. You get to see blossoming spring flowers, including Nepal’s national flower, rhododendrons.
But, what are these easy routes? And, how does one choose them?
Well, we have brought to you seven of Nepal’s relatively easy trekking routes based on the number of hours one needs to walk and the number of days it takes to complete them.
It is such an easy route that even a baby can do it. There is an option for you to walk from as high as Ulleri where you can reach on a jeep from either Pokhara itself or from Nayapul. For those who can walk, you can start walking from Nayapul itself or go up to Tikedhunda. The trail is simple with a slight uphill on a few sections. Over five days, you will get to experience the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges and the heritage village of Ghandruk. The trail from Ghorepani to Poon Hill is full of rhododendrons. Don’t miss the sunrise from Poon Hill.
The route is straightforward and quite easy for new trekkers. Apart from the last day, when you have to wake up a bit early to head up to the Mardi viewpoint, the trek is as easy as it can get. It is so easy that there have been a few people who have trekked it in just a day. Passing through green forests, the trek passes through lush rhododendrons in the lower elevation. The terrain changes as you go higher up as you get to witness the best angle of Machhapuchare along with Annapurna South and Himchuli. This is another trek that does not require you to be fit.
This seven-day trek is one of the shortest treks in the Everest region. The trek can finish in five days but if you spend an extra two days, you can get up from Namche to Khumjung and Khunde, home of a lot of legendary mountaineers. This trek will give you unbeatable views of the Himalayan peaks including Everest, Ama Dablam, Thamserku, Kangteng, Kusum Kangaru, Kongde, Cholatse, Tabuche and Nuptse. It is ideal for those who do not want to go to high altitude but want to see the mountains.
This three-day trek in eastern Nepal can be quite enriching. The hills are chilly and rocky and even though do not go higher than3,800 metres, you will feel that you are. The trek starts at Charikot and passes through Nepal’s only ski village Kuri and ends up at the Kalinchok shrine from where you get to witness mountains like Gaurishankar, Jugal, Annapurna and Everest. There are quite a lot of birds too in the area, so watch the skies.
Don’t have time to get away from the Kathmandu valley? There is a trek you can embark on here in the Kathmandu valley itself. The trek starts from Sundarijal from where you climb along the Bagmati river and reach Chisapani. There, you can witness sunrise along with a hike to Chisapani lake. There, the trail goes to Nagarkot through an okay but long trail. One night rest at Nagarkot will take you to Dhulikhel where you end the trek. It is not exciting, but if you have never trekked, this is perfect. Go out on the trails and take your family along.
Close to Pokhara, this is quite an underrated trek that can be done in four days. Ideal for beginners, you only have to walk four hours a day walking through a lush green forest full of different flowers and orchids. As you do not have to walk as much, you get to enjoy splendid views of Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri from Bumdi, Panchase Bhanjyang, and Bhadaure.
This is the easiest trek on the list as you hardly have to walk uphill. Trekking along the foothill of the Annapurnas, the trek starts north of Pokhara and takes you Kalikasthan, Syaklung and Chisapani and finally ends at Begnas lake. The trek got its name after Prince Charles and his entourage trekked around the area in the 80s.
The trail gives you an opportunity to observe the distinctly different Gurung culture and people along the way. Along with that, you can also get to witness the Annapurna range, along with Machapuchhre and the Langtang range. The trek also does not see a lot of people which means it is perfect during Covid-19 times.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/easy-trekking-routes-in-nepal.html,travel
Nepal Army launches mountain cleanup drive to collect 35 tons of waste,"Monday, April 12, 2021","Kathmandu, April 12
The Nepal Army is launching a campaign to clean various mountains in the country with a target of collecting 35 tons of waste.
Chief of Army Staff Purna Chandra Thapa will hand over a banner of the ‘Clean Mountains’ campaign to the personnel to be involved in the drive today, officially launching the campaign. The campaign will include 43 climbers and guides.
In partnership with various stakeholders, the national military organisation will bring back waste dumped by climbers and trekkers on Everest, Lhotse, Pumori, Ama Dablam, Makalu, and Dhawalagiri. The campaign will conclude on World Environment Day, June 5.
The Ministry of Forests and Environment, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, the Nepal Tourism Board, concerned local governments, and some private agencies are also parts of the campaign.
It is estimated that the campaign will cost Rs 125 million.

China’s restriction on Manasarovar trip takes a toll on Nepali entrepreneurs,"Sunday, April 11, 2021","Most family members of Arun Pandey, a resident of Kathmandu, have already gone to the Manasarovar lake, Burang County, Tibet. His father went to the revered lake as a pilgrim in the 1990s. Coming back, the father told other family members a lot about the lake.
Having heard so much great about the area, Arun Pandey’s son Abijit also wanted to go see if it was exactly the way his grandfather described it. In 2014, he made his plan successful.
Arun wanted to accompany Abijit. But, due to various circumstances, he could not and since 2018 has been trying to go. Work kept him busy most years, but in October 2019 he booked a trip to go there in May 2020. But due to Covid-19, China closed the border and since then, he has not been able to go.
“It seems like I’m not fortunate enough,” shares Arun Pandey, who adds he does not have any hope if he can make it in 2021 also.
Pandey is one of tens of thousands of people who plan a trip to Kailash Manasarovar every year. The lake is not only revered by Nepalis but by Indians too who come to Nepal in thousands to go to Manasarovar. From 2014 to 2019, over 100,000 Indian nationals have been to Manasarovar lake via Nepal. They bring in both money and work for Nepal’s tourism which thrives even in the lean seasons of May-August as each tourist spends at least $1,200 which can go up to as much as $3,000 for the week-long trip.
But, with Tibet closed until December 2021, tour operators reluctantly have announced that the Manasarovar yatra is not happening this year. This they say will cause a loss in revenue for tour operations and for the people dependent on this tour package and lastly the government which earns a million in tax every year.
“Nepal earns around a billion rupees a year through this package alone,” says Mohan Lamsal, the managing director of Makalu Adventure. “This is a big loss to us.”
Kailash Manasarovar can be gone from three places in Nepal. The most popular is via the Kerung border point between Nepal and China in Rasuwa from where the lake is 700km away. Another is via Lhasa from the Kodari border. This, however, is not a trip taken by many as it takes as much as three weeks to go and come back. The final is the route via Hilsa where one can fly through Simikot and reach Hisla from where one can cross the border and get to the lake.
Hardip Singh from Noida, like Pandey, had been planning this trip for years. For one year, he saved enough money that he could take a helicopter to Hilsa. But, at the last moment, his trip was cancelled and he has not been able to go.
“The tour agents said they would take me to any destination of my choice in Nepal. They offered Gosainkunda, Kala Patthar, Lumbini, but I’m just not interested to do that. I can do these anytime I want,” says Singh, adding he is hoping to go to Kailash in early 2022 with this family to fulfil his lifelong dream.
The cancellation of the pilgrimage is taking a bigger toll than usual. While the tour operators continue to suffer, the people who are dependent on this trip are suffering even more. Hotels in Syabrubesi, Hisla and to some extent even Kodari say that the decision has left with a big call to make.
“I started this hotel because I saw thousands of people coming here every year,” says Jeet Tamang from Dhunche which lies near Kerung. “But, the past two years have been as dry as anything. I’ve had no one to stay in my hotel and with loans to be paid, the only way out is to sell the hotel.”
Things are similar in Talkot in Bajhang, where people, whose only source is tourism, are struggling. In the past years, pilgrims heading to Manasarovar via Hilsa used to stay there. In addition, many own hotels in Taklakot in Tibet to cater to Indian pilgrims.
But, ever since China closed down borders in late 2019, many are sitting and hoping things will be okay and they can once again go back to work.
“I used to earn up to a million rupees in three months. This was profit after all my expenses and tax to China,” says Rabi Chhetri. “I’m good for now. But, another year of this will make things hard on me. I have no other business.”
Lamsal says that even though there have been talks, there hasn’t been much positive news about reopening borders. He says his sources in China have told him only to plan trips after April 2022 which he says has cost operators like him a lot of money.
“We have to follow rules. There is nothing we can do about it.”
But, some are planning an alternative to Kailash Manasarovar. Even though Nepalis have been pushing a package to Indian tourists offering them to take them to Janakpur, Pashupatinath, Lumbini and Gosainkunda, there is also talk about a trip to Surma Sarovar in Bajhang itself.
“The place is not as big as Manasarovar, but its significance is almost the same,” says Lamsal. “We need to start finding alternatives and if we can sell Surma Sarovar this year, it will help out a lot of people.”
The Tourism Ministry, however, agrees that the country will lose millions but is yet to come up with any plan to find alternatives to Manasarovar.
When asked if any step is being taken to promote places like Surma Sarovar, the ministry’s spokesperson Taranath Adhikari says that nothing like this is in plans as the officials do not believe many tourists will come due to Covid-19.
“Maybe we can do that in the future, but for now, we don’t have plans to promote destinations like Surma Sarovar in place of Manasarovar,” says Adhikari.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/manasarovar-nepal-toruism.html,travel

"Himalayan Database: Carrying on Elizabeth Hawley’s legacy, the bible of Nepal mountain expeditions goes on","Sunday, April 4, 2021","It is that time of the year for Billi Bierling, the managing director of the Himalayan Database. With Nepal’s mountaineering season commencing, Bierling and her small team have a lot on their plate. Meeting climbers before their expedition, talking to agencies and finding out who is coming to climb what mountain in the Himalayas is an everyday affair for Bierling.
She joined the institute in 2004 because she has a love for the mountains, but little did she know that the Himalayan Database, which she joined help the late Elizabeth Hawley, would become such a major part of her life.
“It is a lot of work, but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed doing this,” says Bierling. “The people I have met along the way and those that I continue to meet is what keeps me going. I would not trade this for anything.”
Even though many had felt that the Himalayan Database, after Hawley’s death in 2018, would have withered, Bierling along with the team set up by Hawley are determined to continue her legacy and make sure that the institution carries on chronicling people journey’s in Nepal mountains and act as a reference for everyone who wants to know anything about them.
The Himalayan Database is nearly as old as the Himalayan mountaineering itself. It laid its roots in 1963 when Hawley, working for Reuters, covered the 1963 American Everest Expedition. Having enjoyed doing that, she continued to collect records of each expedition that happened in the country chronicling journeys of mountaineering legends like Reinhold Messner and Ed Viesturs.
“Back then, it wasn’t as commercial as it is now,” says Bierling. “It was just a few expeditions per year, which is why she’d drive her VW Beetle and go to the airport, which only had three international flights a week, and scan for climbers.”
But, as the commercial expeditions started in the early 1990s, Nepal started to see a lot more mountaineers. In 1993, American climber Richard Salisbury, impressed by Hawley’s dedication and work, gave her the idea of digitalising everything she had done in the past three decades. Taking the idea on board, Hawley then tasked two Nepali girls to do that. It took them 11 years to do so and in 2004, the Himalayan Database was born.
Since then, the team has expanded as well. Currently, it has six members including Bierling. What started as a passion project for Hawley has now become an institution. Climbers started to approach the Himalayan Database wanting their name on it. Nepal’s government along with various other international climbing institutions started to recognise successful attempts only after it was on the Himalayan Database.
“We report facts. Always have, always will do,” says Bierling. “Many people don’t agree with our ways and don’t want to be part of it. That is fine. But, what we do, we do it honestly. We go by facts and if the facts are correct, we don’t doubt summits.”
That said, they have had their fair share of controversies too. Climbers who claim to have reached the summit have had to be told they have not and that, with many, has not gone down well.
“There have been a few cases, especially with Manaslu, of many false summits. Miss Hawley used to tell me we are no judges but reporters, and that is the mantra that I go by till today,” she says. “As for Manaslu, if we are honest, only 10 per cent of the total climbers might have reached the real summit, but we’ve still given people the benefit of the doubt. That was the past; what we do in the future is now going to define how credible we are.”
The database has records of expeditions starting from 1905 up to the spring of 2020 covering nearly 500 peaks in Nepal. Each expedition record contains information that includes dates, routes, camps, use of supplemental oxygen, successes, deaths and accidents. The database is searchable by peak, climber, expedition, nationality, season, mortality rates and causes, and more.
There are selected preset reports plus the capability for custom searches and analyses. Each expedition record contains biographical information for all members listed on the permit as well as for hired members (e.g., Sherpas) for which there are significant events such as a summit success, death, accident or rescue. Each expedition record also contains literature references to major journals, magazines, books and published expedition reports.
These records in the Himalayan Database are considered important to climbers planning expeditions, to journalists and mountaineering historians needing ready access to historical records, and to researchers elucidating patterns of accidents, fatalities and supplemental oxygen use.
“It is quite holistic.”
The reason why it is so detailed is that the team spends a lot of time collecting information. Bierling says all of them spend roughly 30 minutes with each expedition team before the expedition and spend up to two hours once the expedition is over.
“If you’re a one-man team, we won’t take much time. But if we’re interviewing an expedition leader with 25 clients, we take as much as two hours because we will need a lot of details as not everyone makes it up to the summit.”
It is not just the summits that they record. They also have details of why climbers came back and from where. Records of people who died in the mountains and the causes of the deaths are also available.
“There is a reason why the Himalayan Database was considered an authority. If you need any information on Nepali mountains, the database has you covered.”
When asked if Hawley’s strict process had made things simpler, Bierling says it has as she still uses most of what she learnt from Hawley.
“Technology has come a long way, but we still use the system that  Miss Hawley taught us.”
Bierling had assumed the leading role since 2016 when Hawley had stopped. She was 92, and having done it for over five decades, she was tired.
“She was very pragmatic. One day, she said she went blank while taking an interview and told me that she was stopping. She looked like she was done with the Himalayan Database and gave it to me and the team.”
But, Hawley’s legacy lives on. Having seen the importance of the records, expedition agencies in Nepal contact the database and ask them to put their climbers’ name on it. Even Nepali climbers who did not care in the past have now started to ask for their names to be put on the database.
“I feel that is great. The old climbers didn’t care, but the new ones do. They want recognition and that is great.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/himalayan-database-carrying-on-elizabeth-hawleys-legacy-the-bible-of-nepal-mountain-expeditions-goes-on.html,travel
10 destinations in Nepal that are rich naturally,"Saturday, April 3, 2021","Nepal is one of the world’s most beautiful countries that have ever existed. It is a slice of paradise on earth and is naturally as well as culturally blessed. The country is not that big but the kind of diversity that one can find here is astounding.
Because this land is fascinatingly diverse, it draws tourists for several reasons. Some are attracted to the mountains for treks and summits, others revel in the biodiversity in the hills and Terai. Among many, here are 10 of the top naturally-rich destinations for you to visit in Nepal:
The Solukhumbu district covers an area of 3,312 sq km and shares a border with the territory of Tibet on the northern side. The landscape here mostly contains terrain made up of deep gorges, massive rock, and glaciers. It is also home to Mt Everest and one of the natural World Heritage sites, Sagarmatha National Park. Because of this, tourism began in the early 1960s in this area and the district is still very popular among tourists.
The destination consists of a wide variety of flora and fauna including more than 118 species of birds and different varieties of rhododendron. Not only that, endangered animals like red pandas and snow leopards can be seen roaming around this park. The district is inhabited by Sherpas, so can also find many Sherpa villages nearby along the main tourist trails for trekking. The best time to travel here is from October to November.
Ilam is famous for the production of varieties of Nepali teas. The district lies in the tranquil hills of eastern Nepal and is largely covered with tea bushes. But, it is not limited to only teas, many researchers are attracted to this district for the study of rare birds and red pandas. For others, the destination is perfect to have a peaceful picnic, take a short hike in the hills, or even walk around the tea garden. One can truly experience the best of Ilam’s natural beauty.
Ilam is also well-known for its fine cheese along with various agricultural exports. It is also home to an important Hindu site, Gajur Mukhi, a caved tunnel that contains various images of Hindu deities along with the Deumai Khola river.

The major attraction of this district is the last forbidden kingdom, Upper Mustang. Yearly, people visit the destination for a great adventure and a great view of the landscape. But as the name suggests, it is very hard to get there as it is restricted; less than 1,000 visitors are allowed to travel. Tourism here started in 1992 and it falls under the list of the most protected areas of the world.
This area allows you to see the untouched part of Nepal and its own beauty, with ancient monasteries, traditional settlements, and cave dwellings high up on the mountains, and the beautiful architecture on display at the walled city of Lo Manthang. Trekking in this region is also popular among tourists as it offers a picturesque view of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. The best to visit is in March or early November.

Trekkers can get a close view of the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, Gangapurna, Tilicho Peak, Pisang Peak, and Paungda Danda. The Annapurna Circuit has frequently been voted as the best long-distance trek in the world, as it encompassed a wide range of climate zones in its original form.
Another attraction is the Annapurna Conservation Area Project that houses 486 species of birds and 101 species of mammals making it a great attraction for nature lovers.

This is the largest district of the country and covers 5.36% of the total landmass at an altitude of over 5,000 m (16,000 ft).
There is an ancient and remote village known as Dolpo, which is rich in wildlife, beautiful lakes along with snowy peaks, and a pristine Buddhist monastery making this place one of the popular tourist destinations. Some part these areas are also a part of the Shey Phoksundo National Park. The shimmering turquoise waters never fail to captivate tourists, which makes it one of Dolpo’s most famous attractions. Spring is the best time to visit Dolpa for pleasant travel.
Sankhuwasabha is one of the easternmost districts of Nepal, sharing a border with China’s Tibet autonomous region.

7 destinations you should visit to know Nepal’s diverse ethnic culture,"Sunday, March 28, 2021","Nepal is one of the best countries you can visit for your next holiday. It is a country of amazing individuals belonging to different castes, following different cultures and religions, and speaking different languages.
This makes the citizens and the nation unique in a beautiful way. Its identity is not just of being the land of the highest peak of the world, Mt Everest, but also the land with different natural, cultural, and historical resources. The ones who love nature enjoy Nepal, but the people who are interested in history also enjoy the historic values, monuments,  arts, and architecture of Nepal.Nepal is one of the oldest countries in South Asia containing various ethnic groups (i.e. people of the same attributes with similar ancestry, history, language, society) and its native people, where people live with the feeling of brotherhood, helping each other in need. If you are in Nepal, here are a few places you must visit for a culturally rich experience.
One of the most culturally rich destinations to visit in Nepal is Kathmandu. The valley is inhabited by the Newa community, because of which the city is rich with Newa culture. If you are visiting Nepal, Kathmandu–the capital city– is the must-visit destination for you as it gives you the perfect combination of culture, food, festivals, and landmarks that reflect the Newar culture.
The Newa population is one of the original, ethnic, indigenous groups residing inside the Kathmandu Valley. They speak their language, Nepal Bhasa. They have more than 70 different subgroups occupying 4.99% population of Nepal according to the census of 2011.
In Kathmandu, some of the architecturally, culturally, and historically rich places you can visit are Kathmandu Durbar Square, Ason, Swayambhu, and Bouddha Stupa.
If you are in Kathmandu, you can try various local Newa food items such as yomari, chhoila, chatamari, aila and also enjoy some of the culturally-vibrant festivals like Gai Jatra, Indra Jatra, Ghode Jatra, Seto Machhindranath Jatra, Yomari Punhi, Swasthani, Kwati Purnima etc. Other places you can visit for a similar experience are Bhaktapur and Lalitpur.
Ghandruk is a beautiful village, an amazing place for trekking. From the village, you can get a magical view of Mt Annapurna, Mt Machapuchare, Mt Gangapurna, and Mt Hiuchuli. And, you can easily trek to Poon Hill from here.
The Gurung community is an indigenous and ethnic group residing in Ghandruk.

"Nepal withdraws from plan to relax quarantine, visa provisions for tourists","Tuesday, March 23, 2021","Kathmandu, March 23
Last Friday, after the cabinet meeting, some media reported that the government decided to remove the requirement of quarantine for tourists visiting Nepal. Some of them even quoted Tourism Minister Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal to report the news.
However, making public the decisions made that day, the government spokesperson, Communications Minister Parbat Gurung, on Sunday did not say anything about the decision. Why?
Sources say the government, in fact, had made the decision to not require the mandatory quarantine and resume on-arrival visa service also. However, it withdrew from the new decisions before making them public.
On Sunday itself, when Gurung was scheduled to make the decisions public, the Ministry of Health and Population issued a notice saying the number of Covid-19 cases was increasing in India. It also urged the public to avoid crowds and gatherings as far as possible and adopt other safety measures.
Then, officials of the Ministry of Tourism thought relaxing the quarantine and visa rules would contradict the Health Ministry’s appeal. Hence, they decided to withdraw.
Following the withdrawal, tourism entrepreneurs fear their hope, already shattered due to strict quarantine provisions, would be further deferred.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-withdraws-from-plan-to-relax-quarantine-visa-provisions-for-tourists.html,travel
"After a year, Nepal attending international travel mart this week","Sunday, March 21, 2021","Kathmandu, March 21
Nepal is all set to resume its tourism promotion campaign at the international level after a gap of a year.
Nepal Tourism Board says the country will physically participate in South Asia’s Travel and Tourism Exchange (SATTE) in India later this week. The event will be organised in Greater Noida from this Wednesday to Friday.
Nepal’s participation in such an international event is the first since the government halted the international campaigning citing the Covid-19 fears in March last year.
The board will lead the country in the event, but 25 companies including the national flag carrier Nepal Airlines Corporation will also join, informs the board.
The board’s CEO Dhananjay Regmi says the event will be important for Nepal as India is yet to resume visa services for several countries in the world.
The board plans to decide about other upcoming events in India and other countries after assessing the response it gets during the SATTE.
Meanwhile, a new plan has been made to attract Indian tourists, focusing on hill stations and destinations near the border, according to him.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/after-a-year-nepal-attending-international-travel-mart-this-week.html,travel
"5 ponds in Kathmandu, other than Ranipokhari and Kamalpokhari, you should know about","Sunday, March 21, 2021","Although landlocked, Nepal is no short of water bodies. The country is rich in water resources with its rivers, lakes, and ponds. In ancient times, the visionary rulers of the Kathmandu valley established many hitis and ponds for easier access to water. Many of these are on the verge of extinction today.
People commonly know about Kamalpokhari and Ranipokhari that lie in the busiest areas of the city. They have stolen the limelight, mostly for controversies they have been surrounded with. But, here are five other water bodies that lie inside the Kathmandu district that you should know about:
This pond, in Tangal/Handigaun, is famously known for its Tundaldevi Gahana Khojne Jatra (a festival to search jewellery). This festival is celebrated every year on Chaitra Shukla Ashtami. Here, locals place the idol of Goddess Tundaldevi Vaishnavi and her youngest sister, Goddess Mahalaxmi. The festival starts at Handigaun, reaches the pond, and back.
The pond lies at the side of the road, giving people easy access to observe and enjoy the landscape.
Another culturally important pond is Naagpokhari at Naxal. The pond is most celebrated on Naagpanchami, the fifth day of waning moon that usually falls in July-August. On the day, devotees offer dubo (Bermuda) grass, milk, along with paste of rice grains and red vermilion powder to the statue of the serpent god (Naag) at the centre of the pond. The pond is a resemblance of the legend that the Kathmandu valley once was full of snakes when it was still a giant lake.
Every day, devotees throng the temple of Goddess Santoshi inside the premises. Likewise, every morning and evening, youth can also be seen thronging the pond for recreation and exercising purposes.
There are not just one but many lakes that relate to the story of snakes residing in the valley. Taudaha, which lies in the southern part of Kathmandu, is believed to be a remnant pool that existed after Kathmandu was drained of water after Lord Manjushree cut the hill to let the water out.
This waterbody is arguably the only waterbody in the valley that still houses numerous bird species including over 20 species of migratory birds. It is one of the important sites in the valley for recreation purposes and birdwatching.
This waterbody shares the same name with Kamalpokhari in the heart of Kathmandu, but it also once shared the same fate. Due to various reasons, including the lack of local initiative, this Kamalpokhari had dried up. But, in April 2016, the pond was revived by the local women in the initiative of Oxfam Nepal’s Cash for Work programme.
After its restoration, the water reservoir is now being used for irrigation and drinking water purposes and has become an unofficial swimming pool for the locals. No one knows exactly when this was built. However, it is said it was built either during the Lichhavi or Malla periods.
Like the aforementioned Kamalpokhari, Ikhapokhari is now another pond that is being revived by the locals. The Centre for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) is leading this public campaign called ‘Recharge Kathmandu Campaign’. Ikhapokhari became a victim of land encroachment, the lack of local initiative, urbanisation and unplanned water supply management.
This waterbody is situated at Nyokha, Chhetrapati, spread across around seven ropanis of land. This is another pond whose details of its origin and use are not known. But, it is believed it was used as a recharge pond along with Ranipokhari when it was first built, for a long time.
Before it dried up, the pond was culturally very important and specially thronged during Paachhare for rituals. It was also the location that many other local indigenous communities frequented for recreation and their male members’ coming-of-age ceremonies.
The pond is dry now, but locals have plans to soon replenish it to its original glory.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/5-ponds-in-kathmandu-other-than-ranipokhari-and-kamalpokhari-you-should-know-about.html,travel
Gosainkunda: The shy and beautiful lake makes you long for another trip,"Saturday, March 20, 2021","A magnificent pond on a rocky surface surrounded by sharp snowy peaks. It seems as if nature is a skilled craftsman with Gosainkunda as its best work of art. Sometimes, it feels it has pulled on a sheet of snow, while other times, it is smiling in the reflection of the blue sky. This glacial lake is as shy and beautiful as any budding youth.
It had been forever since I longed to see the magical Gosainkunda. It is not too far away from the capital. After reaching Rasuwa, one can easily reach Gosainkunda.
I had not been able to manage time until now. This year though, I got the chance to see Gosainkunda upfront until my heart desired.
Following the invitation of Lila Lama, we went to Gosainkunda. Lama is the head of MD Group, under which is MD Adventure Travel & Tours. The company recently introduced a heli package for Gosainkunda. Under this package, we–a team of three–including tourism entrepreneur Ram Sundar BK, went to Gosainkunda.
We arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport at 7 in the morning. Helicopter flights should be scheduled as early as possible in the morning.
From there, a helicopter carried us to Gosainkunda in just about 17 minutes.
When we reached the skies of Gosainkunda, the peaks were all covered with snow. We could see people walking and dancing around the lake.
Gosainkunda lies at an altitude of 4,380 metres above sea level inside the Langtang National Park. It is a centre of faith for both Hindu and Buddhist devotees. The stone in the middle of Gosainkunda is believed to be a relic of the temple of Lord Shiva.
Gosainkunda is also a popular site for heritage tourism. There is a religious belief that performing puja after bathing in the cold and holy water of Gosainkunda fulfils one’s wishes.
Every year on Janai Purnima and Dashain, a unique fair is held for five days and ten days respectively, at Gosainkunda. During this time, thousands of pilgrims reach Gosainkunda to take the holy bath and offer their prayers in the holy water.
According to a myth, during Samudra Manthan, gods and demons participated in getting the elixir situated below the sea. One of the stories says Lord Shiva drank the Kaalkut poison that came out while gods and demons churned the sea to save the world.
When the poison reached his throat, he became irritated and restless. To calm down, he reached the Niladri mountain and buried his trident. He drank the holy water that came out of it and stayed there.
In 2007, Gosainkunda was also listed as a Ramsar site (a wetland of international importance) along with nine other lakes inside the national park. Others include Saraswatikunda, Kumachokunda, Dudhkunda, Raktakunda, Chandrakunda, Suryakunda, Aamakunda, Ganeshkunda and Bataaskunda.
After reaching Gosainkunda, I realised how generously nature has decorated Gosainkunda. No matter how much you look at it, your heart is not satisfied; you just want to keep watching.
Lila Lama, President, MD Group
We are active in Nepal’s tourism industry for the past few years. Now, with various packages, we are working hard to revive the country’s tourism industry hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
For that, we have introduced helicopter tour packages for the destinations that are important from religious and cultural perspectives. These include Gosainkunda, Langtang, Tilicho, the Everest region and Muktinath.
Of them, we feel Gosainkunda is a favourite one. Some days, there are more than 100 people visiting this place perhaps because it is filled with natural beauty and is connected to religious feelings. Likewise, it is quite close to the capital. We have targeted the population that cannot trek to this place but is willing to come here.
In the meantime, they have got an opportunity to visit Langtang that has been a popular destination among foreigners in Nepal. The domestic tourists’ interest in our destinations further motivated us.

Jill Wheatley overcomes brain injury and blindness as she runs and climbs Nepal’s mountains,"Thursday, March 18, 2021","Laying in a hospital bed watching the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in 2016, Jill Wheatley had given up on life. In 2014, she was hit on her head with a baseball while teaching students the sport in Bavaria, Germany, suffering a traumatic brain injury that left her partially blind. An adventure freak who loved running, biking and skiing, the thought about not being able to do any of that, coupled with the fact that she would not see with one eye, left her wanting to die.
However, after spending two years in seven hospitals across three countries, Wheatley now lives life one day at a time as she has embraced and accepted that her life has changed.
When she got out of the hospital, she only had 30 per cent vision. But, from within, she had none. She loved the outdoors and had committed her life to it, but the injury had left her without a goal. “Things were very dark,” says Wheatley. “But, thankfully, even when I had given up, people around me did not. And, that is why I am here today.”
Just before she got out of the hospital, the Rocky Mountains inspired her to do something that, back then, was merely a dream – run in all the major mountain ranges in the world within a year.
“It was ambitious, but maybe due to the mountains’ tenacious and resilient nature, I was attracted to them. And, that is how my life started to turn around.”
That is what brought her to Nepal in 2017. And since then, she has always been back. She runs in the mountains, treks, and when given the chance, even skis. Recently, she reached the summit of Ama Dablam and now has plans to reach the top of the eighth highest mountain in the world, Manaslu.
“I fell in love with Nepal from the moment I got here. Not just the mountains, but the people too… everything about this country feels great.”
During her first visit, all she wanted to do was trek around Nepal. But, she was convinced by a friend to take part in Annapurna 100, a trail race that started in Pokhara and ended at Sikles.
She had never run in the mountains and was only getting used to her new life. But, when she stood on the starting line, she felt that is where she belonged.
“Initially, it was quite daunting as it started at dawn and ended after dusk when it was pouring down. But, as I got going, I started to have fun and ran and ran and ran.”
At the end of the 50km race, when she reached the finish line, she was shocked. Only two had crossed before her. Wheatley, who had never run a mountain race, to everyone’s and most importantly her surprise, had come third.
“There was only Mira Rai and a french woman ahead of me. It was shocking.”
Ten months ago, Wheatley was in a hospital bed. The doctors had told her if she did not start developing a will to live, she would die. But, here she was, running in the high mountains of Nepal with athletes from all across the globe. Not only did she run, but she also competed and that started to fill her with confidence.
“I came third behind Mira Rai and a french lady. It was unbelievable,” she says.
After Annapurna 100 in 2017, she was invited to take part in a stage race around the Manaslu Circuit in the same year. Initially, she was sceptical as she had a plane to catch, but after a bit of thinking, she was on her way to Aru Ghat.
“These races in Nepal connected me to a lot of people. I also started to be a bit more open to talking to people about what I had been through as well. I gave a few interviews that got me messages from all across the world saying how I have inspired people. All of this was extremely humbling.”
She says that she never does anything to inspire people, but does things to inspire her to get going and grow. But, when she hears people from around the world say how she has helped them during their bad times, she says, it feels good.
“I still have bad days because not all days are pretty alpine pictures. I always tell myself, today might have been a bad day, but it’s not necessary that tomorrow will be the same.”
After finishing the Manaslu race, she knew she would be back in Nepal. But, before that, she had to finish her goal of visiting all mountain ranges. As soon as she finished it, she rushed to Colorado to meet and thank her team of doctors and nurses who got her up and running.
“That was emotional. I still talk to a few of them.”
That is when she decided that her life had changed and with that her goals. With mountains in the back of her mind, after spending a few months in Europe trying to ski, she was back in Nepal in 2019 to climb the Island Peak and Lobuche. Apart from that, she was also helping out in trail races and ice climbing festivals.
“I help out Lizzy (Hawker) and Richard (Bull), but I like it here because I love the mountains,” she says. “They are therapeutic.”
As she was preparing to leave, Covid-19 locked down the world as life threw another curveball. In a bid to avoid spending time in the city, Wheatley along with a few mountain guides left for the Annapurna to go skiing.
“Being in the mountain makes you focussed. You can’t be thinking about anything else. No mind wandering. That is why I wanted to go there.”
She was there for a while, but authorities cracked them down and before she knew it, she was back in Kathmandu spending the lockdown alone at a rented apartment.
“It was frustrating, but I’m glad it is over.”
With the lockdown over, and with Nepal mountains open again, she with Vinayak Jaya Malla, an IFMGA-certified mountain guide left for Ama Dablam as a practice before she headed to Manaslu.
“It was great. Just two of us climbing to the summit was just breathtaking. It’s a memory that’ll stay with me forever. It healed me in so many ways.”
Now, her sights are set on climbing Manaslu in the autumn as she continues to push herself. Along with that, she has also been a part of a few digital conferences in Nepal where she spoke to other differently-abled people about injuries and recovering from them.
“It’s been great to be part of that. To be able to share my story with people who have been through something similar or something worse is humbling. I hope I get to do more of that.”
When asked if she had ever thought of climbing Everest, she says she gets this question a lot but is not sure just yet.
“Maybe someday I will, but for now I’m taking it one step at a time.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/jill-wheatley-overcomes-brain-injury-and-blindness-as-she-runs-and-climbs-nepals-mountains.html,travel
Homestay operators want govt to set standard for their business,"Tuesday, March 16, 2021","Kathmandu, March 16
Homestay operators across Nepal have demanded that the government set a standard and an operating procedure for their business.
Concluding its third national workshop seminar recently, the Homestay Association of Nepal said such a standard and operating procedure were essential to control and prevent various malpractices happening in the name of homestay business.
The association said it would also develop its own standard incorporating various aspects such as branding, classification, quality, and recognition. Likewise, a code of conduct would be made for the visitors also.
The association demanded that the government award homestay operators who contributed something good to the state and take action against wrongdoers after monitoring and evaluation.
On its part, the association expressed its commitment that homestays would comply with the WHO standard set for the prevention of Covid-19.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/homestay-operators-want-govt-to-set-standard-for-their-business.html,travel
Nepal govt’s plan to recognise mountain guides on its own disappoints internationally-certified professionals,"Monday, March 15, 2021","Vinajayak Jaya Malla started his mountain guide training in 2009. Having worked in the mountains, Malla knew that to stand out from the crowd and to become a good guide for his clients, he needed extra training. For the next nine years, he toiled hard training in mountains, both small and big, across Nepal battling extreme weather, learning basic and advanced mountaineering skills.
Battling extreme winter conditions in areas like Langtang and Manang,  where he honed the art of rock, ice and snow crafting, Malla topped his final assessment of his NNMGA/IFMGA training making him a recognised mountain guide both nationally and internationally
“It took me a while, but I finally got there.,” says Malla. “Had trouble with finances, but it’s been worth everything as it will bring me a wide range of opportunities in the future.”
Malla is one of 70 odd Nepalis who have been recognised by the International Federation of Mountain Guides Association (IFMGA). This recognition they get through Nepal National Mountain Guide Association (NNMGA) has brought them more clients, better opportunities which include climbing in Europe, South America, North America and Antarctica and most importantly better remuneration as they are the only recognised mountain guides in Nepal.
But, things are now changing. The Department of Tourism, through the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, released a statement about the passing of a new law that will recognise red book holders of the Nepal Mountaineering Association as mountain guides.
While this has been seen as great news by many from the mountaineering sector, the NNMGA, which has been trying to set a benchmark, is concerned that the government and the Department of Tourism are undermining their work and trying to tarnish the sector by handing out mountain guide certificates to anyone.
“The NNMGA gives licences based on training and tests,” says Ang Norbu Sherpa, the association’s president. “This is not a mountaineering training course. It is specific for guides because it takes a lot of training and wherewithal to become a guide.”
But, according to the new rule, anyone who possesses a red book provided by the NMA will be recognised as a national mountain guide. The NMA hands out three types of books to people who work in the mountains for data and insurance purposes.
The first is a black book that is given to the kitchen and support staff who work in the high altitude areas. If a person works and renews this book for two years in a row, that book is upgraded to a blue book, which recognises the person as a support climber. The book can be upgraded to a red book, which gives the person the title of a sirdar (expedition leader) who manages all the other Sherpas in a climbing expedition or trekking group.
“We are just trying to recognise the mountaineers who have done so much to the sector,” says Meera Acharya, the director at the Department of Tourism’s mountaineering department. “These people have sustained the industry so we cannot avoid what they have done for the mountaineering sector anymore. This is a way to respect them and help them.”
The NNMGA, aware of this, welcomes the government’s plan of recognising the climbers, but most of its members say that red book holders should be called ‘expedition guides’ and not ‘mountain guides’ as the term ‘mountain guide’ is vast.
“The role of a mountain guide is more than just managing logistics,” says Tenzeeng Sherpa, the treasure at the NNGMA. “It takes a lot of hard work to learn ethics and the code of conduct of becoming a mountain guide as they need to work under pressure and make decisions according to the situation.”
Tenzeeng says that the reason why the NNGMA is concerned is it, as an organisation, wants to make mountaineering safe and create guides who can be trusted internationally. He says that Nepal producing these mountain guides who have experience in tackling complicated situations will help create opportunities to cater to high paying clients. Currently, all the high paying clients bring mountain guides from other countries because most do not trust Nepali guides.
But, record-breaker Kami Rita Sherpa says that this is just an assumption and statements like these undermine the efforts of people like him.
“I’m not a certified international mountain guide, I never have been and never will be, but people still come and ask me to guide them to the top,” says Kami Rita. “This is a positive step which will do good for the mountain sector, which is why I fully support this decision.”
The NMA also is positive about the move as it says this new rule, which had been lobbied by it for years, has finally been put to practise.
“They are international mountain guides. These are national mountain guides. There is a difference as they will always be on top. But, the rule will recognise them both as Nepali and international mountain guides, which is good for them,” says Santa Bir Lama, the president of the organisation. “But, I don’t understand their problem with recognising these climbers, some of whom have given their all to the sector. I feel this is unwarranted.”
Another concern from the NNMGA was about people who have not climbed and were idle and still renewed their red book could become mountain guides. This they say is dangerous as it might tarnish the reputation of Nepali mountain guides in the international community.
“A red book is given to all Everest summiteers. If that is the case, everyone will come claiming that they are mountain guides and that, in the long run, will create a lot of problems in the mountain,” says Tenzeeng.
But, the NMA says that people who are not climbing actively will not be getting the licence. Even if they do get the mountain guide certification, their clients who have access to their climbing history will not choose such a person.
“You are climbing in the death zone. You will want an experienced head with you. If a person chooses someone with minimal experience just because he is cheap, that is on the climber, not on the NMA or the government,” says Lama.
Kami Rita also echoes Lama. He goes on to say that the NNGMA, which has little over 70 climbers, cannot sustain the industry and welcomes the government decision as it is an upgrade.
“We are called porters by foreigners. Even though we do so much work, we are still tagged as people who carry stuff. I’m positive that this recognition will bring about a positive change,” he says.
An NMA member, who did not want to be named, says that the NNMGA was trying to undermine the work of the 2,000 climbers who sustain the sector and had intentions of closing the NMA as it wanted to run a monopoly in the mountain sector.
“Of course, we are angry. This is one good thing that is happening to us and they want to take this away from us,” he said. “If you look at Everest, over 1,000 of us go and work there. The NNMGA only has maybe 10 who go work at Everest.”
He adds that as the NMA members work in Nepal, the rules and laws must be made taking them into consideration.
“If they want, they should go abroad to guide. They are international guides, right,” he questions, adding many of them would not even last a few days above camp 2 on Everest.”
When asked if the mountain will be safe even with untrained guides on the mountains, Lama and Kami Rita along with other members of the NMA say that it will. They question if members of the NNMGA has conducted any rescue operation and add that not one of them had even been a part of the fixing team on Everest.
“They will use the ropes that we fix and climb to the top,” says Kami Rita. “If they are that trained, why don’t they fix ropes? I’m up for a competition with them you know. And I’m sure that non-internationally certified mountain guides will win.”
The NNMGA members also say that they understand how good climbers they [those advocating for the new rule] are but question if they are as good a mountain guide.
Another concern they have is who will take action if anything bad happens in the mountains. As an organisation, the NNMGA takes action against any members who does something wrong in the mountain. But with 2,000 new mountain guides being added, they question who will be responsible for them.
In response, the Department of Tourism says it along with the government of Nepal will take action as it is the body that is handing out these mountain guide certificates.
“As the regulatory body, that is our job,” says Acharya.
But, the NNMGA says that as the department’s liaison officers do not even go to base camp, the chance of it taking action is highly unlikely.
Meanwhile, the NNMGA on Monday filed a writ petition opposing the decision.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-govts-plan-to-recognise-mountain-guides-on-its-own-disappoints-internationally-certified-professionals.html,travel
Everest 2021: Govt forbids taking photos and posting them on social media,"Wednesday, March 10, 2021","Kathmandu, March 10
The Department of Tourism on Tuesday released a new set of rules for the upcoming mountaineering season, one of which prohibits taking photographs of mountaineering activities on Mount Everest and other peaks and sharing them on social media without the consent of the climbers.
The rules, which many say is pointless, is likely being implemented to avoid controversies like the one that happened in 2019 when Nirmal Purja (Nimsdai) posted a picture of a traffic jam on the Hillary Step.
“The rule has been in place for a few years. But, everyone does it,” says Meera Acharya, a director at the department. “We don’t want controversies like the one that happened with Sudhir Chaudhary to happen again. If people want to take photos and videos for commercial use, they will have to take a permit.”
Apart from this, there are other rules that, industry experts say, are could affect the mountaineering industry.
One of the rules states that all climbers applying for Everest climbing permits will also have to submit their medical report issued by a certified doctor that prove they are in shape to climb Everest or any other peaks. This, the department says, has been done to avoid deaths on Everest that happen due to fatigue.
A new rule related to rescue has also been added which has made it mandatory for all rescued foreigners to be taken to a well-equipped hospital when evacuated from the region. This rule has been in place to ensure that fake rescues, which was in the international news a few years ago, do not defame Nepal and its mountaineering industry again.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-2021-govt-forbids-taking-photos-and-posting-them-on-social-media.html,travel
"Conservation vs tourism: Restriction on helicopter flights in Everest skies brings Nepal govt, entrepreneurs at odds","Wednesday, March 10, 2021","In mid-January, Sudhir Chaudhary, an Indian journalist, flew to Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar on a Simrik Air helicopter. To many, his visit was seen as an excursion of Nepali tourism’s USP,  the Khumbu valley. As Chaudhary is the Editor-in-Chief of Zee News, there were no further questions to him regarding the purpose of his visit; he went and came back without much trouble.
But, a few days later, on his prime-time programme, Chaudhary released a sensational piece in which he stated India also had the right to claim Everest as theirs. While Chaudhary and the piece even made it to the front page of a national daily in Nepal, yet another controversy surrounded his visit.
In order to film at Everest Base Camp or Kala Patthar, both of which fall under Sagarmatha National Park, a separate permit must have been obtained. According to Nepali officials, Chaudhary obtained no such permit.
Now, to make sure such things do not happen anymore, the park authorities are bringing a new rule to bar any helicopters, which are not transferring goods or are there for rescue, from landing or hovering above Syangboche. On February 17, it issued a circular to all helicopter companies stating that landing was allowed only at Lukla, Namche and Syangboche.
With the tourist and mountaineering season on the horizon, tourism entrepreneurs and helicopter operators, however, have called this decision ludicrous, made without proper planning, as it would have a direct impact on helicopter companies, high-end tourism and the mountaineering industry which was hoping to recover after a lean season in 2020. However, the government has its own defence.
“The decision to us seems stupid,” says Pratap Pandey, the managing director at Kailash Helicopter. “People come here to see Everest. It has and will always be Nepal’s USP when it comes to tourism. To take that away from people willing to spend to get there is kicking ourselves.”
Pandey says the decision has been made by low-level employees without considering the impact it will have on the industry or the economy in general.
However, the chief conservation officer at Sagarmatha National Park, Bhumiraj Upadhaya, says the decision was made by the national park in coordination with the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of Nepal with two things in mind – control wildlife smuggling and protect the area from pollution caused by helicopters.
“This is a protected area which has a lot of wildlife. It’s also a UNESCO World Heritage site. We have to try to protect it the best we can,” says Upadhaya.
He says that in recent years, the helicopter movement in the area was increasing incessantly, which is why such a decision was made. Chaudhary’s stunt, which put a dent in Nepali nationalism, also played a part, he says.
“All sorts of people come and go from the national park. We hardly have details as the helicopters didn’t need to take permissions from us. We now want them to do so which will help us monitor and regulate people coming and going out of the national park,” he adds.
But, Pandey says that the national park, in trying to hide its flaws, has come up with a ludicrous rule.
“If they want to monitor people coming and going, they can do so at Lukla where every helicopter has to land. How can they say that its hard to monitor when they can’t even put an officer at Lukla to check on things,” says Pandey.
However, Pemba Sherpa, the assistant conservation officer at the national park, says this is due to a lack of resources. But apart from that, this rule has been imposed in order to stop wildlife contraband smuggling.
“We’ve heard about how helicopters in various parts of the country have been involved in the smuggling of wildlife contraband. There have been cases in Dolpa and Humla. Who says it can’t happen here in the Everest region?” says Sherpa.
But, Suman Pandey, a tourism entrepreneur and the CEO of Fishtail Air, says just saying there are chances of wildlife contraband smuggling is not enough.
“When has such an incident happened in Khumbu?” he questions. “If they can say for certain, then it’s fine. But it just seems like a hypothesis.”
He further adds that if such a rule is implemented, the government needs to bring out an exit plan for helicopters companies that have spent a fortune and planned for 10 years in advance. The reason he says there are 35 helicopters in Nepal is the demand created by flyng high-profile tourists to these high mountains.
“Imagine what will happen to the investments made by entrepreneurs. I am all for conservation, but we need to also do a detailed study. Else, we are just missing out on high-end tourists,” says Suman Pandey.
Sudip Thakuri, a professor at the Central Department of Environmental Sciences at Tribhuvan University, says that helicopters flying in the area might cause avalanches, but till now, there has not been a significant one to report on.
“There are fears that the sound of the helicopter may cause avalanches, but nothing like that has happened yet. That said, there is no saying it won’t happen so we have to be careful about this,” says Thakuri.
But, for Bijaya Amatya, the CEO or Kora Tours, a travel agency that caters to high-end tourists, this rule is pointless. One of his packages includes a tour of Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar after which the visitors land at Kongde for breakfast before flying back to Kathmandu. Around 200 people a year come for that, he says.
But, this new rule, he fears, will be sending a negative message to prospective tourists. He also calls on the government to take action on specific helicopter companies which do not abide by government rules and regulations.
“Why should the entire tourism industry suffer due to a mistake by a few people,” he says.
Even the mountaineering sector is set to suffer if this rule is imposed. Mingma Sherpa, the chairman of Seven Summit Treks and the vice-chairman at Heli Everest, says these are regressive rules which will affect mountaineering deeply as many use helicopter service.
“This rule will break our back. But, we have hope that the government will not let that happen,” he says.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/helicopter-in-everest-issue.html,travel

"Visit these biggest stupas in Kathmandu to pay homage to Lord Buddha, and sightsee","Saturday, March 6, 2021","Buddhism is one of the biggest religions in Nepal and it has inspired many philosophies and architectures around the world. Following which, many stupas have been built here. Stupas are structures made of a hemispherical base, majorly containing relics of Buddha. Above the base is a triangular structure with 13 steps, the structure inspired by the Buddhist guide to mediation towards nirvana. Some of these architectures are famous worldwide.
For domestic and international tourists, here we have a list of the biggest stupas in the Kathmandu valley that one can visit.
Swayambhu Stupa is one of the most famous stupas in the whole world. This ancient stupa lies atop a hill at its peak in the western part of Kathmandu city. It is also a religious site that is believed to be the first structure in ancient Nepal (or Nepal Mandal).
According to Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī, one of the most popular and important chronicles in the Nepali history, this structure was made in the beginning of by 460 AD by Lichhavi King Vasudeva, the great grandfather of King Manadeva. Archaeologists have found a damaged stone inscription on the site proving the story.
According to Swayambhu Puran, a Buddhist scripture, it is believed a lotus flower carrying eternal light came into existence out of nowhere when the Kathmandu valley was still a pond. This stupa’s name means “something that existed on its own” in Sanskrit and Nepal Bhasa. In Tibetan language, the name means a sublime tree.
This is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Kathmandu for Buddhist followers and the second most important pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhist followers.
Bouddha Stupa is known to be the largest stupa in the Kathmandu valley. It is located on the north-eastern outskirts of Kathmandu, about 11 km away from the centre. This UNESCO World Heritage site is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Nepal, all day long throughout the year.
It is believed that this stupa was built by the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo around 600 AD when he decided to convert to Buddhism. It is also believed that the stupa contains the remains of Kassapa Buddha (one of the seven buddhas of antiquity).
Bouddha was also previously called Khaasti Chaitya, where people collected water to fight the drought as per the myth.
This stupa has been in existence since the fourth century in the ancient neighbourhood of Chabahil. This 2,300-years-old stupa is located in the south-western side of central Chabahil.
It is said the stupa was made by Charumati, the daughter of the Indian emperor Ashoka. She was married to the prince of Kathmandu, Devapala Kshatriya. This was proved after a brick with her name inscribed on it was found during the 2003 restoration of the stupa.
The stupa can be seen from the roadside and is famous among the youth who frequent the site. Adjacent to the stupa is Charumati Bihara that the princess built together with the stupa.
Shree Gha: is a smaller stupa located near Thamel and is a very peaceful place to visit among those busy streets. This stupa can be easily missed since it is located out of people’s sight.
Built in 1650, Shree Gha: (also known as Nagha Bahal chaitya) is referred to as a small replica of the great Swayambhu Stupa complex. It is also called Kaathe Swayambhu Shree Gha Chaitya.
Inside the premises are a two-storey pagoda to Goddess Harati (the goddess of smallpox) and a Tibetan-styled Durbgon Janchup Choeling monastery in the north-eastern corner. There are numerous statues, chaityas, and a school inside the complex and is a popular site for Buddhist Newars, especially during Gun laa.
In the reign of Emperor Ashoka, many Buddhist stupas were built in Patan including four Ashoka Stupas. Ashoka visited the Kathmandu valley some 2,500 years ago and built what were the perfect examples of the ancient traditional architecture. Indian emperor Ashoka took refuge under Buddhism, swearing to leave all the violence behind, and went to pilgrimage.
These four stupas are believed to mark four corners of Patan, of which three have earth-mound base structures with prayer wheels around them. The Teta Thura (East) near the Ring Road, Pucho Thura (West) in Pulchowk, and the Ibahi Thura (North) in Sankhamul, and the Lagan Thura (South) near Lagankhel bus park.
This stupa is another well-known stupa among Buddhist pilgrims. It is situated near the Pim Bahal Pokhari.
The complex is a pretty small square and surrounded by prayer wheels. It is a somewhat quiet space and is located near Patan Dhoka. It is unknown who and when it was built, but Pim Bahal is worth a visit to admire the quiet ambience and its natural beauty by the nearby pond.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/biggest-stupas-in-kathmandu.html,travel
Kyanjin valley in Langtang is waiting for you for the best adventure experience,"Saturday, March 6, 2021","In 2017, The New York Times featured Langtang on its list of ‘52 Places to Go in 2017‘. After all, Langtang is a great gift of nature. Located in the Rasuwa district, it lies near the Tibet border.
This is the same place where the entire settlement was buried and thus destroyed by an avalanche after the devastating earthquake of 2015. Nonetheless, the Kyanjin valley, which is a part of the Langtang National Park, used to be crowded with domestic and foreign visitors. However, tourism activities here have slowed down a bit as of now. Despite having the necessary infrastructures for tourism, this valley has not been able to attract many visitors. But, still, Langtang is waiting for the visitors with the same sincerity and an offer for the best tourism experience.
Although I had heard a lot about Kyanjin, I had never got a chance to explore it because of my busy schedule until this time. Now, due to the Covid-19 impact, the number of foreign tourists has decreased and so has my busyness. Taking this opportunity, I planned to go to Kyanjin with my family as it would be a lot of fun while travelling with the family.
As a tourism entrepreneur, I was well-aware of the geography and the facilities available there. Therefore, we reached there on a helicopter. It took around 45 minutes to reach there from Kathmandu. Since only five people can go at a time, my family (my mother, wife, son, and daughter) and I travelled to Kyanjin.
With the amazing snow-capped peaks in the background, Langtang has given shelter to the rare wildlife. The unique combination of huge rocky mountains on the head and flat grazing land on the lap has made this place no less than a ‘heavenly paradise’.
The Kyanjin valley, located at 3,850 metres above sea level, is another natural craft included in this paradise. It can be called the Himalayan valley. It is also a confluence of ancient heritage and religious faith.
The Kyanjin Gompa (Monastery) located here is said to be 700 years old. And, the valley is named after this monastery. This monastery is also the highest human settlement in the Langtang valley.
From this point, one can thoroughly catch a glimpse of dozens of mountain ranges in Nepal including Langtang, Dorje Lakpa, Lirung, Jul, Gangchemp.
Towering mountains, crystal clear rivers with hard waves, flat grazing lands, all these features of Kyanjin make it one of the best adventure trekking routes. Not to forget, it is one of the nearest trekking destinations from Kathmandu. The trek can start from Syaphrubeshi. It can take up to a week to walk to this valley situated on the foothills of Langtang.
Once you reach the valley, there is also another trekking route, Kyanjin to Helambu. It may take another three days to travel to Helambu via Ganja La. But, we did not choose that way.
It was not only mine but also my family’s first trip to Kyanjin. This trip turned out to be much more joyous than I had thought. When we reached there, I felt like all my stress was gone.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kyanjin-valley-in-langtang-is-waiting-for-you-for-the-best-adventure-experience.html,travel
"Climbing legend Conrad Anker: For high-altitude climbing, Nepalis are the best","Wednesday, March 3, 2021","Conrad Anker is an American rock climber, mountaineer, motivational speaker and author. He is one of the world’s most renowned adventurers, backed up by his list of achievement from the past three decades.
He was the first to find George Mallory’s body in 1999 and has a number of the first ascents to his name including the Shark’s Fin on Mount Meru in India.
Until 2018, Anker was also a part of The North Face’s climbing team which he had led for the past 26 years. It is, hence, safe to say that Anker is a climber without parallel. He has stood on top of Everest three times, once without bottled oxygen, and was the first to climb the continental drift route up the southern face of El Capitan (El Cap) in Yosemite National Park, California.
His relationship with Nepal dates back to 1990 when he came here to climb Ama Dablam. Apart from that, he has climbed the Southwest Ridge of Cholatse and also attempted to climb the Lunag Ri with the late David Lama. That is not all, in 2003 Anker, along with his wife, established the Khumbu Climbing Centre with the aim of increasing safety margin of Nepali climbers and high-altitude workers by encouraging responsible climbing practices in a supportive and community-based program.
Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Anker, who is here working on a project, and talked about Nepalis creating history on K2, the Khumbu Climbing Centre and how mountaineering in Nepal has evolved.
Excerpts:
What brings you to Nepal?
Here to check up on the Khumbu Climbing Centre (KCC) and a few other projects that I can’t really talk about now. It is a bit of a surprise for everyone, both here in Nepal and abroad.
How long have you been coming here? How has the Khumbu region changed since your first visit?
I have been coming here since 1990 when I came to climb Ama Dablam. Since then, I have been coming quite regularly for various projects. In 2003, I started the KCC with my wife in a bid to give back to the community and this is one of the reasons I keep coming back.
Talking about changes, it has changed a lot. The number of people on the trail is quite high and the quality of lodges in the area has improved significantly. Another major change is access to electricity that is great for the people living there.
The best thing, however, I think is the cellular technology which many people there had not even dreamt of. Landlines would have taken decades to come, but with mobile phones, the cellular technology just leapfrogged which has been a boon for everyone going there.
You have known and are working with Nepali mountaineers for a long time now. How have they changed since you first saw them?
They have evolved a lot in the past three decades. You can take Nims (Nirmal Purja) as an example. The fact that a Nepali climber was first able to climb 14 peaks in less than seven months, and then now the recent success on K2 in the winter goes to show what they are capable of. What I like about them is after climbing for others for nearly half a century, now they are climbing for the fun of it and that is the most important thing.
As you mentioned Nimsdai, how big a role is he and others like him playing in marketing Nepali mountaineers to the world?
He has been a breath of fresh air. I met them recently and all of them are great people. His leadership quality is great and as a person, he is quite fun too. Through his energy and confidence, he has in a way uplifted everyone which is nice to see. His training and where he comes from makes him who he is and that I think it is great for Nepal and its mountaineering industry.
How big of an achievement do you think climbing K2 for the first time in the winter was?
It was amazing what they were able to do. And, to do it as quickly as they did is quite an achievement. It just proves that for high-altitude climbing, they are the best. I think the world needed to see that. The progression that they have made is quite heartwarming to see.
Let’s go back to your project. Khumbu Climbing Centre has been in existence for the past 18 years. Have you been able to achieve what you envisioned all those years ago?
The aim of the KCC was to teach climbing to the people of Khumbu. Apart from that, we wanted people to appreciate climbing. It was like an avocation. It offers interested people training on how to climb mountains, teaches basic skills to them to work in the mountains. And, I think we have been able to do that.
It is not about being a porter or a climbing guide, it’s about how to survive in the mountains. Through that, we want people to have fun climbing all types of things from rocks to the ice to mountains. It’s a good place to meet like-minded people as well. This, I think, has been my greatest legacy so far because this will change and affect people’s lives.
You have been associated with a lot of first ascents and new routes. What is it that drives you to do so?
What drives me is to be the first person there. That is it. It is a huge opportunity to be the only person on a particular route up a particular mountain. People say its a kick, but it is more than that. The joy of being the first can’t be put to words sometimes.
You have also mentored a lot of people during your time at The North Face. How do you know whom to mentor?
Well, it depends on how interested the climber is. How much passion s/he has for climbing and how much they are willing to learn. That is the first step. Even here in Nepal, we find a lot of people here who we mentor through the KCC. Dawa Yangzum Sherpa and Pasanga Lhamu Sherpa Akita are a few people that we have mentored through the KCC among various others.
In your career, you have come through a lot of adversaries like the avalanche in Shishapangma and the heart attack in Lunag Ri. How have you been able to do that? How do you get back up and get ready for a new adventure?
Well, you wake up motivated and happy. That is how you find things. It is not easy, but it is what I love to do and it comes to me naturally. It is just a scary moment and for a while, you get an intense fear. But, that just momentary and it slowly subsides with it.
What is the difference between climbing here in the Himalayans to other places?
The size of the mountains here is a major difference. It’s huge and active from a geology standpoint. But, what I like about climbing in Nepal is the people. You get to meet so many people and get to learn a lot of things. Whenever I come here and climb, I feel happy. There is something about Nepal and its people.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/conrad-anker-for-high-altitude-climbing-nepalis-are-the-best.html,travel

Everything you should know about proposal to convert Palpa’s Rani Mahal into heritage hotel and protests against it,"Tuesday, March 2, 2021","The Nepal Tourism Board has proposed converting the historical palace of Rani Mahal of Palpa into a ‘heritage hotel’. The board says it has planned that Rani Mahal can be made a ‘honeymoon destination’.
“We seek diversification in tourism. For that, we need to engage in different types of products, one of which is Rani Mahal,” says NTB CEO Dhananjay Regmi. Further, he adds, “Rani Mahal is a destination associated with love. Why don’t we connect it with newly married couples?”
The NTB has planned that if Rani Mahal is developed as a heritage hotel and promoted in India among other countries, a lot of extravagant tourists can be attracted. Therefore, the NTB has already submitted its proposal along with its ideas from the local government to investors.
However, it has stirred a controversy among stakeholders.
Rani Mahal in Tansen municipality of Palpa is a historical monument located on the bank of Kaligandaki. It was built in the last decade of the 19th century by General Khadga Shamsher in memory of his wife Tej Kumari Devi.
That is why,  Rani Mahal is considered a symbol of love, often called ‘Nepal’s Taj Mahal’. Rani Mahal has an attractive four-storey building with 24 rooms, two ponds, a temple garden, and a pavilion, and structures including a horse stable.
The place has become dilapidated day by day in the absence of the owning body and also due to lack of budget at the local level and lack of protection by the central government.
On the one hand, the concerned authority has not been able to make any structure to protect the palace from erosion. In such a scenario, the NTB has proposed to renovate the exterior and interior of the aesthetic building without damaging its historical appearance.
The rooms inside the palace can be designed in an original style which can be sold at a higher rate than any other ordinary hotels, according to Regmi. “The palace can be turned into a hotel without damaging its real structure and style,” informs Regmi.
According to the NTB, the local government and tourism entrepreneurs will be given this responsibility. Also, the income from this and ownership will be at the local level. Likewise, the NTB has also put forward the concept of spending a certain portion of the income received from the hotel for the protection and promotion of the palace.
As proposed by the NTB, water-based tourism activities from rafting to swimming can be conducted in the  Kaligandaki river in front of the palace. Wide river beaches will be managed.
Similarly, according to the NTB, tourists going to Rani Mahal on a honeymoon tour may also visit the nearby Bhairav ​​Temple and Tansen Bazaar. By attracting tourists to Rani Mahal, the NTB aims to entice the tourists in visiting other tourist destinations of Palpa.
The NTB has also proposed an investment of Rs 300 million in the first phase to develop the heritage hotel, and prepare infrastructures for water activities, and structures in the riverbank in three years.
“The local government and the tourism entrepreneurs are positive about this proposal,” claims Regmi, “ It is a model for preservation and development of historical buildings.”
This kind of proposal as well as practice is not new. The practice of transforming the historical palace into a hotel started when former Finance Minister Madhukar Shamsher Rana’s father Maheshwar Shamsher opened the Nepal Hotel in a palace in 1951. Likewise, there are plenty of examples of ‘heritage hotels’ in Nepal like Hotel Shanker, and Hotel Yak and Yeti.
However, protests have started against the NTB proposal, stating that it is a historical heritage site. They say the proposal cannot be compared with Hotel Shanker or Hotel Yak and Yeti because all those palaces turned into hotels earlier were the personal property of the Ranas. But, Rani Mahal is a historic public property.
The Hotel Association of Nepal (HAN) itself is not in favour of the proposal. Binayak Shah, the first vice-president of the association, says tourists can be attracted by building hotels for commercial purposes in the vicinity of such historical heritage site by preserving such heritage.
Shah says, “Rani Mahal, built on the concept of Taj Mahal in India, cannot be turned into a hotel. Rani Mahal is a living history of western Nepal.”
“How many tourists will visit if Taj Mahal is turned into a hotel? India will not do that,” he says, “Hotels should not be built within the heritage site. Instead, such an environment should be created where hotels around that place can run smoothly.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everything-you-should-know-about-proposal-to-convert-palpas-rani-mahal-into-heritage-hotel-and-protests-against-it.html,travel
Nepal set to resume tourism promotion campaign at int’l level after a year,"Sunday, February 28, 2021","Kathmandu, February 28
Nepal is all set to resume its tourism promotion campaign at the international level after a gap of a year.
Nepal Tourism Board says the country will physically participate in a South Asian travel mart to be held in New Delhi and Mumbai of India in March. The month marks exactly one year since the government halted the international campaigning citing the Covid-19 fears.
The board has allocated Rs 10 million for the promotion campaign in the Indian cities.
Immediately after India, the board team will go to China and Bangladesh also for similar campaigns.
The board wants to launch the campaigns wherever possible, but any of such events in Europe is unlikely anytime soon, informs the board’s Chief Executive Officer Dhananjay Regmi.
Fearing the further spread of different variants of the virus, various international events in the region have either been postponed or held online.
In such cases also, the board will continue pushing for promotion virtually, according to him.

From Kathmandu to Muktinath on motorbike: More healing than tiring experience,"Saturday, February 27, 2021","This year, after the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, was suffocating, to say the least. It was more suffocating emotionally than economically or socially as was the obligation to stay indoors. Now, that the Covid-19 fear has somewhat subsided, and public life is returning to normal, we thought to travel now.
We wanted to travel. But, where? Then, unexpectedly we blurted out-Muktinath.
I first went to Muktinath about four years ago, on a jeep, with family members. This time, I decided to go on a motorcycle to have a different experience. On a Royal Enfield, I started my journey. Although I came to ride a bike, I did not have the experience of travelling on a long journey. On top of that, I did not have the experience of riding the Enfield.
I first made my brother ride it. But, when we reached Kalanki, it got frustrating for me and I decided to ride myself.
Our destination for the first day was Baglung. So, we rode all along without any hesitation. Even after reaching Baglung, I did not feel particularly tired. After dinner, with our journey to Muktinath in mind, we did not realise how fast we fell asleep.
The next morning, after getting fresh, the journey started. On the way, we visited Galeshwar Dham in Beni municipality-9 of Myagdi. It lies at the holy confluence of the Rahu and Kaligandaki rivers.
The place is a religiously, historically, and mythologically important shrine with amazing architecture. It is also known as a supernatural powerhouse. Said to be situated on a giant ‘chakrashila’ with a perennial pond, and trees in the middle of this rock, the view is really amazing.
According to a myth, Lord Mahadev was carrying the body of Goddess Sati on his way to the Himalayas. When the neck of Satidevi fell off, it took the form of Shiva and, hence, started being referred to as Galeshwar Temple.
After visiting the Galeshwar temple, we headed towards Muktinath. Located three kilometres north of Benibazaar, there is a gate which is also known as Muktinath Gate.
The road was not good, it was the same as in the past. But, smooth or not, we had to continue forward, for new experiences.
That day we arrived at Muktinath, in the evening.
There were not many people on the road, and I wondered why.
My question was answered only after arriving at the Muktinath Hotel when I realised that travelling on a motorcycle would be very risky during this season. If the road gets covered with snow, there is no alternative road. While the hotel staffer was talking about the risks, my heart sunk a bit.
Muktinath was different from what I saw four years ago. There were good food and accommodation in the area now.
There was no crowd visiting the Muktinath temple either. I felt very happy when I stepped on that sacred soil as if all the burdens of the mind got relieved at once.
Life was light, and my heart was healed.
We paid our respects to god and returned. At the hotel, we had tea and breakfast and left. Similarly, with plans to visit Upper Mustang and Manang, we kept shortening our road back to Kathmandu.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/from-kathmandu-to-muktinath-on-motorbike-more-healing-than-tiring-experience.html,travel
4th Shuklaphanta Tourism Festival begins,"Monday, February 22, 2021","Kanchanpur, February 22
In its bid to promote eco-tourism in the Shuklaphanta National Park, a weeklong Fourth Shuklaphanta Tourism Festival has started here on Sunday.
Inaugurating the festival, Minister for Forests and Environment Prem Ale Magar called for a publicity campaign to promote tourism activities in the national park.
Minister Ale Magar stated that the ministry would run programmes to reduce human-animal conflicts along with biodiversity conservation efforts. The ministry would advance the tasks of infrastructure development as well as the conservation of lakes that are vanishing lately.
On the occasion, Bhimdutta Mayor Surendra Bista said that the festival was organised aiming to revive the tourism affected by Covid-19.

"Everest 2021: With strict rules, Nepal missing out on revival chance","Sunday, February 21, 2021","Pasang Sherpa, in March 2020, was ready for his fifth Everest expedition. He had prepared everything for the two-month journey to the top of the world. He had trained better than any other year and bought various equipment that would help him in the mountain. In order to go up the ranks from a climber to a mountain guide, he had even polished his speaking skills. Pasang had a lot of hope and dreams in 2020. But, all of it was shattered as the mountaineering season was over indefinitely with the government shutting down the country on March 24.
“It’s been a tough year,” says Pasang. “This (climbing) is all I know and have been doing for the past nine years. Hopefully, this year will be better.”
As Pasang hopes, mountaineering has gradually picked up in Nepal. In October and November 2020, a few teams went on expeditions on Lobuche, Ama Dablam, Mera Peak, Island Peak, and Manaslu.
Earlier this year, China decided to bar all tourists from Tibet. Major expedition agencies like Mountain Madness and Alpenglow Expeditions also cancelled their expedition due to Covid-19. Consequently, Nepali entrepreneurs had hoped that this would result in a lot more bookings. But, that has not been the case yet.
Even though there have been bookings on all major 8,000ers, the number is quite low. Everest will likely see little over 150 climbers, less than half of how many turned up in 2019. The same goes for Lhotse, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and Makalu where bookings are less than half of what they were in 2019. And, with rules about Covid-19 quarantine requirement for the trekkers and mountaineers changing regularly, expedition agencies are scared that the bookings they have might also be cancelled.
“This was the time we should have capitalised and made rules favourable for mountaineering,” says Thaneshwar Guragai, the manager at Seven Summit Trek(SST), one of the most popular expedition agencies in Nepal. “But, the government does not care about the thousands of people whose lives depend on mountaineering.”
Having recently created history on K2, Nepal and its mountaineers have been in the news all over the world. This, Guragai says, could have been a springboard to bring in more adventurers to the country. But, with ever-changing rules, he says many of SST’s clients have decided to cancel their trip.
“We had enquiries about smaller peaks, but with this rule of compulsory quarantine, despite a negative PCR, and a Covid-19 insurance of $5,000, many have cancelled because it is just not feasible for them,” says Guragai.
He says that due to the same rule, many people went to Pakistan in the winter to be part of the K2 expedition because, in Pakistan, mountaineers do not have to quarantine or get Covid-19 insurance, just a negative PCR report will do.
“In many countries, they don’t even sell Covid-19 insurance. These people have all cancelled their trip,” says Guragai.
Apart from this, he says, clients have cancelled as airlines have stopped them from boarding the plane as they did not have a visa. He says the airlines stopped them from boarding as they were not aware that for mountaineering, Nepal was already offering visa on arrival.
“Its these small things that create problems for us,” says Guragain.
Almost all Nepali expedition companies have similar problems. They say most of the clients are happy to comply with the Covid-19 insurance, but to many, the quarantine rule seems a bit pointless.
“They rather have travel insurance than Covid-19 insurance, but they are willing to get that. What many are irked by is staying in Kathmandu for seven days even when they test negative to the virus,” says Mingma Dorchi Sherpa from Pioneer Adventures.
The director at the Department of Tourism, Meera Acharya, also says the mountaineering industry will suffer if these rules are not amended. She says the department has been getting a lot of complaints from expedition agencies about quarantine rules. She also fears a lot of mountaineers will instead choose to go to countries like Pakistan, Chile or Tanzania, which have no such rules.
“We need to look at what our competitors are doing at these times. We have to be proactive and not reactive if we want a good mountaineering season,” she says.
The government, however, says that the rules are in place to save Nepalis from Covid-19. Mahendra Guragain, the secretary at Covid-19 Control Management Committee, says that the committee has had a formal request from the Tourism Ministry asking to change the rules for mountaineers, but things will take time.
“We are discussing. But, we need to make sure that the new UK variant does not spread. These rules are in place for precisely that,” says Mahendra Guragain. “With things coming under control, maybe we will do as the Tourism Ministry wants us to do, i.e let tourists with a negative PCR report travel freely in the country without quarantining. But, we have to wait and assess the situation.”
Foreign expedition agencies have a different take on this. Mountain Madness says it is cancelling expedition on Everest for another year citing scarci­ty of test­ing, treat­ment, and vac­cine dis­tri­b­u­tion in Nepal.
“After dili­gent and exten­sive research, dis­cus­sions with physi­cians and pub­lic health experts, as well as a great deal of soul-search­ing, Moun­tain Mad­ness has offi­cial­ly can­celled all Spring 2021 Nepal treks and climbs.” its statement read.
Another international expedition agency, Madison Mountaineering, however, is coming and says it is confident of having a unique Everest expedition in 2021.
Garrett Madison, the founder and expedition leader at Madison Mountaineering, says he is fortunate that most of his clients from 2020 rolled over their expedition to 2021. He adds that having run a successful operation on Ama Dablam in 2020 also gave him the confidence to operate the expedition.
“There is a lot of speculation and misinformation in the news these days. Fortunately, we have good connections with the government and know what the rules are. It’s pretty straightforward really, just a five-night quarantine’ in Kathmandu before we head to the mountains to begin our trek to base camp. My clients are on board with this,” says Madison.
His clients include Mark Pattison, the former NFL wide receiver who wants to become the first and oldest NFL player to summit both Everest and Lhotse within 24 hours. Pattison says as he will be vaccinated by the time he gets to Nepal, he is not worried about Covid-19.
“The rules weren’t that big a problem,” says Pattison. “I am ready to comply with anything as long as it gets me to Everest. As for the insurance, I’m quite happy to pay a little extra so that I have full protection. As the premium wasn’t that expensive it wasn’t a problem.”
But, not every climber thinks like that.
A climber who does not want to be named says he cancelled this year’s expedition because he is not in a position to spend extra.
“I already need to spend around $40,000 for the expedition. Due to these rules, I might have to spend another $2,000. I just can’t afford,” he says, “I still don’t understand why Nepal’s government is so stupid. Extra quarantine and Covid-19 insurance for someone who will have two negative PCR reports in a week are just very stupid.”
As a result, this climber is going to Tanzania to climb Kilimanjaro and says he will definitely rethink coming to Nepal as these protocols are too archaic for the 21st century.
“As a country, I think Nepal needs to change with time. Look how easy things are in Pakistan or Peru,” he says.
Things like these are worrying expeditions agencies. While they are sure that people will come to climb this season and in the future, the number, they say, is expected to come down.
Guragai says this will hit the people who are dependent on mountaineering more than it will affect the expedition agencies.
“If we had clients we would be doing two to three expeditions which would sort us out for a year,” says Tendi Sherpa, a Seven Summit Trek guide. “But, it looks like it’s only going to be Everest for me.”
According to the Department of Tourism, around 100,000 people depend on mountaineering to make ends meet. During the spring climbing season, a Sherpa guide like Tendi can pocket around $6,000 for his two months in the mountains. Even cooks at basecamp earn up to around $1,500 and a porter can earn up to $1,000 which is quite a lot considering Nepal’s minimum monthly wage which is around $150.
But, with the number of mountaineers expected to be low, only the fortunate will have jobs this spring.
That said, the number being low is good news for the mountain and the mountaineers who will come climb this spring. While there was a queue of people on Everest in 2019, this year things are definitely going to be different.
“I’m quite glad that it will not be as chaotic as in previous years. Hope everything goes smoothly and we get to step foot on the highest point on earth,” says Andrew Hughes, another Madison Mountaineering client who is also going to be attempting to climb Everest and Lhotse.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-2021-with-strict-rules-nepal-missing-out-on-revival-chance.html,travel
10 things every traveller should know before visiting Nepal,"Saturday, February 20, 2021","Planning a trip to Nepal? Great! Nepal is an amazing country with lots of things to do. It is also one of the cheapest countries in Asia for your vacation, which you can enjoy without regret. But, to optimise the vacation, there are some things you must know before visiting Nepal.
Here are some basic things you need to know before visiting Nepal:
Unlike what most people think, Nepal is a separate, sovereign country and not an extension of India or China. If you have booked tickets already, you might know this, but a disclaimer is still in place.
Nepal is a mountainous country with an average elevation of 3,265 m. It is also home to the eight out of 14 tallest mountains in the world, and the best place for those interested in mountain climbing, hiking and trekking. But, this also means roads are hard to travel and rough in the mountainous and hilly regions.
The best time to visit Nepal is between October and December when the skies are clear and the weather is calm and dry. This is perfect for time for adventurous activities.
In January and February, the winter prevails in Nepal. This time is perfect if you want to refresh, look at beautiful skies from Namche Bazaar or have a quiet and overall pleasant trekking session thanks to a low number of travellers during these months.
And, if you want to fully enjoy the natural beauty of Nepal, the best time is during late May when the spring starts and the flowers like rhododendrons start blooming, making for an amazing sight to behold.
There are lots of great places in Nepal that you would not want to miss. But visiting all of those places will take you a lot of time. So, for starters, get a tourist guide or find a group for yourself. It will save you a lot of time and will be a lot easier to trek and hike.
The must-visit place to start is the Pashupatinath temple, one of the historic Hindu temples, which is not too far from the international airport. Another would be all the durbar square areas in the Kathmandu valley, each representing its own unique history, architecture and culture. Outside Kathmandu, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, Lumbini, is also a great place to 5isit because of its historical and religious importance. Other naturally rich sites are Chitwan, Khaptad, and Rara.
Getting a tourist visa to Nepal is not that complicated. You can simply apply for a visa online within 15 days before the date of arrival in Nepal. All you need is the address of your hotel room you are staying in in Nepal and a recent digital version of your passport-size photo that you can upload in your application.
But, Nepal also offers on-arrival visas, which have been suspended now due to the Covid-19 crisis. Else, you can get your visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport and costs you USD 25-100 (in cash) per single entry. Prices are also determined by your trip duration which might be around 15-90 days. And, extending a visa is also pretty easy here and are only allowed to stay up to 150 days since your arrival in Nepal.
If you are visiting Nepal for the first time and are wondering where to stay, you do not have to. From five-star hotels to affordable hostels, everything is available according to your budget. The Dwarika’s Hotel, Kathmandu Marriott hotel, Babermahal Villa might be great options if you are looking for the best lounging experience in Kathmandu. But, if you want a budget hotel, there are plenty of such options too with great services. Do your research carefully and confirm services you need with the hotels before booking.
If you looking for lounging outside the Kathmandu valley, there are plenty of hotel options too, especially in major hubs like Pokhara and Chitwan. You will also get hostel and homestay options, for a cheaper more authentic travel experience.
The cost of visiting Nepal is pretty cheap and so is travelling around Nepal. Prices will vary from place to place, but around USD 25-30 is enough for your daily expenses in Nepal including food and decent accommodation. Avoid buying foods inside airports or tourist destinations as they might cost you more. Travelling around Kathmandu in a taxi will cost you way more than travelling in a public vehicle.
One thing you might want to prepare is for the entrance fees. In heritage sites and other popular tourist attractions, you will need to pay; eg Kathmandu Durbar Square will charge you USD 10 per entrance, Swyambhu Stupa costs USD 2 and Pashupatinath temple will cost you USD 10.
For trekking and mountain climbing, also consider permit fees and national park entrance fees.
If you ever visit Nepal, you must try local and authentic cuisines, no matter which part of the country you travel to. But, what you need to understand is that Nepali local foods are filled with spices. If you are not used to it, you might have problems with digestion. It is better to avoid spicy foods. Take caution and keep medicines at your disposal if you are keen to try all.
Also, local people are not familiar with the concept of food allergies or intolerance [gluten, dairy]. So, if you have an allergy or intolerance to any food, please let the hotel or your host know beforehand. You can research the food in the area you are travelling to and make a list. It is for your own safety.
Before you come to Nepal, you need to understand what you can do and cannot do in this country to avoid all problems that can arise from misunderstanding or cultural gap.
Mountain climbing and trekking is very common in Nepal. But, do not go trekking or do any type of activity alone. Hiring a guide might be a good idea since English is not a commonly used language outside Kathmandu. Bringing any sort of weapon or drugs can be considered illegal in Nepal, so avoid it at all cost.
Public display of affection like kissing should also be avoided since it is considered inappropriate in Nepali culture.
Nepal’s flag is the only non-quadrilateral flag that represents a country. It consists of two juxtaposed triangles with a crimson-coloured base and deep blue borders. It has a white crescent moon with eight rays in the upper part and a white twelve rayed sun in the lower part.
People’s sentiments, as well as the constitution, require you to respect the flag. Damaging, stepping over it, discarding and disrespecting flag can result in a three-year jail sentence or NRs 30,000 fine or both. Unlike in other countries, you have to be very careful about making merchandise out of Nepal’s flag. Using colours is okay, but it is considered immensely disrespectful to wear Nepal’s flag in anything below the belt areas. Printing flags on other pieces of clothing also needs to be done with caution and respect.
Nepal also has a strict mathematical description of how the flag should be made. It has provisions on who can hoist the flag and when.
With the pandemic taking its toll, all people coming to Nepal will be required to have papers proving either a negative Covid-19 test or that you have taken the vaccine. Follow self-quarantine and, afterwards, wear a mask all the time when you are outside to reduce the risk of transmission.
Other than this, the government has recommended travellers get vaccinations for some most common diseases in Nepal including malaria, polio, hepatitis A and B, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, yellow fever, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), flu, chickenpox, DPT, etc. Avoid interactions with street animals as they may transmit fleas or diseases which you do not want.
Because Nepal is a developing country, health facilities might not be available, outside Kathmandu, whenever needed, so take necessary precautions. Try to carry your water while travelling since purified water is not easily available everywhere in Nepal.
Lastly, public toilets are not as you imagined here in Nepal. Most of these public toilets are not maintained or cleaned properly. So try to avoid them or enter at your own risk. In long, forest routes, they are even less. Also, always carry your sanitiser or soap.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/know-before-coming-to-nepal.html,travel
Ranikot has got potential to attract Kathmandu hikers but lacks infrastructures,"Saturday, February 20, 2021","Ranikot, a place that blends historical significance and natural beauty, is situated about 2,000 metres above sea level near the border of Bhaktapur and Panauti.  Of late, Ranikot has become one of the favourite travel destinations for many visitors.
Mainly, after the lockdown, people who were confined to their houses visited this place to inhale fresh air and enjoy the natural scenery. Not only this, but widened roads also contributed to making this place one of the popular routes for hikers.
There are many routes to hike to this place. Some of these are Suryabinayak-Ranikot-Aashapuri, Suryabinayak-Ranikot-Phulchoki and Suryabinayak-Ranikot-Lankuri Bhanjyang, making Ranikot the midpoint. Also, from here, one can enjoy the surreal view of the Langtang mountain range and the Kathmandu valley.
Apart from natural beauty, Ranikot carries great religious and historical significance. It is said that there used to be a palace in Ranikot at some time in the past. However, it has not been confirmed yet. As per senior citizens of this place, royals, especially kings, used to come here and rest.
Although there is no building in Ranikot at present, one can see the remnants of old bricks. Ranikot has also made the news as there have been plans to construct an open zoo in this area.
There are plenty of other destinations, mainly religious places, on the way to Ranikot, such as the Suryabinayak temple, from where Ranikot lies at a distance of 7.2 kilometres.
Similarly, another famous religious place on the way to Ranikot is the Doleshwar Mahadev temple, which is also considered as the head of Kedarnath, one of the four dhams of Hindus. The locals even call it Siparu Mahadev.
Likewise, there is also an idol of Bagh Bhairav ​​in Ranikot. There, fairs are held on the full moon day of Baisakh and Mangsir every year.
This place is also suitable for bird watching as it is surrounded by dense forests. Rare birds such as spiny babbler are now found in the area. Therefore, the Panauti municipality has declared this area as a bird conservation zone recently.
Ram Sundar Bake, the director of Village Highland Resort, complains that the government has not paid attention to the infrastructure development of Ranikot, even though this place has natural, historical and religious significance. He also says that this place has not been highlighted properly in the media.
“There has not been any in-depth study of the historical part of Ranikot. Necessary infrastructures have also to be prepared for tourism development. About two kilometres of the road are still unpaved and dirty,” he adds, “Because of the road problems, visitors have not been able to reach here easily. There is also a problem with the mobile network and electricity. Although we have taken initiatives in this regard, the concerned bodies have not shown any interest yet.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ranikot-has-got-potential-to-attract-kathmandu-hikers-but-lacks-infrastructures.html,travel
Visit Badimalika to view nature and to live culture on your next holiday,"Wednesday, February 17, 2021","Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a former member of Nepal Tourism Board, used to talk about Khaptad and Badimalika frequently. He used to say that one has to get there once in a lifetime. That made me put the place on my wishlist. However, circumstances were not appropriate to plan for travelling to Badimalika.
Luckily, I got an opportunity to fulfil my long-awaited dream thanks to Deepak Khadka, a tourism entrepreneur, who brought a helicopter tour package to support the tourism development of Khaptad and Badimalika. Utilising this offer, I  reached there.
The natural beauty of Khaptad and Badimalika is beyond words. What a beautiful gift of nature!
The wide grasslands spread all over, colourful wild-flowers on the foothill, gurgling river in between, and a temple on its bank make Badimalika no less than a beautiful landscape painting created by a skilled artist. I was stunned by the charm of Badimalika.
I wonder what magic there is in the natural beauty that makes our mind happy every time. The scenic beauty of Khaptad and Badimalika is breathtaking.
Badimalika is a wonderful destination for those who enjoy the natural beauty and have religious beliefs. Badimalika welcomes visitors with Mt Api and Mt Saipal in the background.
When you reach the huge grasslands here, your mind is filled with enthusiasm. These fields change their appearance as per the seasons. In winter, these fields are covered with snow and turn white. The beautiful flowers blooming on the green lands make it colourful and distinctly attractive in the rainy seasons.
Badimalika receives the most number of visitors during Badimalika mela (fair).
A big fair is held in Badimalika on the day of Ganga Dussehra and Janai Purnima every year. Pilgrims and devotees from different districts of the country as well as India come here to attend the fair with a belief that their wish will come true.
At that time, local vendors set up shops. But, at other times, there are not many shops and hotels.
But, where do the devotees and tourists stay?
Devotees and visitors have to make their own arrangements for food and shelter as there is no suitable place to stay there. Nonetheless, the temple management team has built a Dharamshala for the devotees to stay there.
Due to the government’s lack of access to Badimalika, herbs of this area are being smuggled out of here. Now, the government should set up a check post at Badimalika.
A priest has been appointed in this temple by the government as it is one of the powerful Shakti Peeths of western Nepal.
One has to travel to Sanphebagar of Achham from Dhangadhi or Nepalgunj on a four-wheeler. Then, there is no alternative to walking from Sanphebagar.
If one travels via airways, one can reach Bajura Airport, Kolti from Nepalgunj. Then, one has to walk for a day to reach the district headquarters, Martadi. From there,  a three-day walk takes one to this beautiful place.

Govt’s double standard keeps Nepal’s mountaineering industry at stake,"Monday, February 15, 2021","Kathmandu, February 15
The government of Nepal has been accused of a double standard regarding the implementation of the policies adopted to control the Covid-19 crisis in the country and promote the tourism industry.
Whereas political demonstrations without adherence to the requirements of safe distance are frequent in the country, the government still requires foreigners entering the country to stay in quarantine for seven days. It is noted that Pakistan, where lies the second highest peak of the world, has already removed the provision of quarantine for the mountaineers.
Therefore, tourism entrepreneurs fear international climbers will choose Pakistan instead of Nepal in the upcoming spring season if the government does not revise its protocol.
“Most of the complaints that we receive from travel agencies are about quarantine,” the Department of Tourism Director Mira Acharya says, “Many fear the mountaineers could deviate towards Pakistan this time.”
Nepal receives thousands of mountaineers every spring, but it did not see anyone last year due to the crisis. Therefore, the entrepreneurs want the government to relax some provisions for them, but the concerned government officials seem indecisive.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/govts-double-standard-keeps-nepals-mountaineering-industry-at-stake.html,travel
Nepalis on K2: Mingma G narrates his and fellow Nepalis journey to mountaineering hall of fame,"Sunday, February 14, 2021","Mingma G Sherpa, before he left for Pakistan to climb K2, the second-highest peak in the world, earlier this winter, wanted to prove a point. Having failed to reach the top last year, for Mingma G, this was all or nothing. He had spent a fortune of his own money and taken no clients. But, to put his name and the Nepali flag in the mountaineering record books, he was ready for anything.
K2 was the last great prize in mountaineering: the only 8000-metre peak unclimbed in the winter, hence the last great mountaineering adventure. Since the 1980s, K2 had seen only seven attempts in the winter, all ending in failure. Summiting it would book a place in mountaineering’s hall of fame. But, for Mingma G and his team, it was also a chance to show the world how capable Nepali climbers are when it comes to high-altitude mountaineering.
“The international media and the mountaineering community were calling us a weak team,” says Mingma G. “Only me and my team know how much effort we put into this expedition. There was no chance we were going to let anyone else beat us to the top.
Born in Rolwaling valley in Dolakha district, Mingma G’s journey in mountaineering started in 2006 when he helped his uncle at Manaslu as a ‘climbing Sherpa’. Having seen his father, grandfather and uncles climb to make a living, Mingma G knew that he would eventually get into the sport and on his first expedition, he reached as high as 7,300 metres. The next year, he reached the summit of Everest, after which he never looked back.
First, he was lured in by the brotherhood and fun in the mountain. Later, it was the money that kept him going as he became the first Nepali climber to make the most ascents of 8,000-metre peaks without using supplemental oxygen. But, he always yearned for more. Maybe that is why, he solo climbed Mount Chobutse, a 6686-metre mountain above his village in the Rolwaling valley in 2015.
“At one point, mountaineering becomes an obsession and you start looking for the edge,” he says. “Apart from that, I wanted to prove to the international climbing community that Nepali climbers are also technical when we have to be.”
That Chobutse summit got him a lot of attention, after which he started to dream about climbing in the winter.
By 2016, all but one of the 14 8,000-metre mountains had been climbed in the winter. The last that remained was the most difficult: the savage mountain K2.
“I wanted to do it for our mountaineering community. It was a shame that Nepal didn’t have a name as the first climbers in any of the 13 winter accents. The coming generation would ridicule us.”
He tried it in January 2020 with Iceland’s John Snorri, China’s Gao Li and Slovenian Tomaz Rotar. However, due to bad weather and poor health, he gave up his summit bid and came back.
This year, however, things were going to be different from the start. He was climbing with Nepali mountaineers Kili Pemba Sherpa and Dawa Tenzing Sherpa and without foreign clients. Joining him in the mountain was record breaker Nirmal Pujra (Nimsdai) and his team along with a commercial expedition from Seven Summit Treks. Nepal was running K2, and he would be getting all the help he could need there.
But, his expedition nearly hit a brick wall before even leaving Kathmandu. Both Kili Pemba and Dawa Tenzing were hesitant about going as were their wives who had heard about how people die on K2.
“Convincing their wives was hard. It took time and both Kili and Dawa, who are also parts of my expedition company, were in a dilemma about going. They were afraid that they’d lose jobs, but I was taking them because they are my best climbers. When they agreed, we rushed to Pakistan.”
The fear was justified. According to the recent history on K2, approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit. Even this year, five have perished on the savage mountain.
Having learnt a lot from last year, he even left for Pakistan early so he could make the best use of the good weather.
“We wanted to give it our best shot. So, we left Kathmandu on December 6, 2020, for Pakistan.”
After meeting Nepal’s ambassador to Pakistan and briefing him on what they were to do there, he along with his climbing buddies left for Skardu from where they began the long trek up the Baltoro and Godwin Austen Glaciers.
“It was so snowy, it took a week to get to the base camp. When we reached the base camp on December 18, the only team there were John Snorri, Ali Sadpara, and his son Sajid.”
The trio of Sherpas then spent a few days acclimatising and assessing the situation. As ropes were fixed till camp 1 (6,050) by Sadpara and Snorri, they waited until December 21 – the start of winter according to the astronomical calendar. On 21, they reached camp 1 and stayed the night there. It was cold, but all three were prepared for it. On 22, their plan was to fix ropes to camp 2 (6,700) and they did so effortlessly.
“Various media outlets internationally had written that reaching camp 2 would be our best achievement. Wanting to prove them wrong, we reached  camp 2 in just two days.”
Fixing ropes to camp 2, they returned to camp 1 where they spent the night battling the high wind. On 23, they went back up to camp 2 to deposit tents and ropes for the coming days and returned to the base camp to rest.
Mingma G says that the weather gods were very kind on him and his team. The weather cleared just as they started their trek to basecamp until the day they fixed ropes to camp 2. After 23, the weather started to deteriorate and they stayed at the base camp on December 24-26.
On 27-28, after the weather cleared, they spent the night at camp 1 and camp 2 respectively for acclimatisation, braving temperatures as low as -30 celsius. On 29, they headed to fix ropes to camp 3 but stopped just below the Black Pyramid and spent the night there.
“We fixed ropes to 7,000 metres just below the Black Pyramid. Our plan was to push for the summit on 30, but due to heavy loads and bitter cold, we gave up after walking for an hour. We realised that day that you move slower in the winter than you do in the summer.”
On 30, they planned to fix ropes to camp 3 (7,200 metres). As they were on the way to camp 3, they ran out of ropes that they had brought along. They radioed Chhang Dawa Sherpa, the expedition leader of Seven Summit Treks, and asked him to tell Nimsdai and his team to bring some ropes. They even used strong old ropes on the mountain as they made their way up.
Soon after the radio call to Chhang Dawa, Mingma Tenji Sherpa from Nimsdai’s team came up and helped as they fixed ropes to camp 3. After fixing ropes to around 7,300 metres, where the team left oxygen, oxygen regulators and ropes, they decided to call it a day and come back to the camp they had set up at 7,000 m and called it a night.
On the way back, Mingma G met Nimsdai for the first time.
“All by himself, he was carrying 200 metres of ropes for the later part of the expedition. He did not complain that he was alone nor did he make a deal of it. That day, I had a lot of respect for him.”
At 7,000 metres, another problem plagued Mingma G as Kili Pemba started to show symptoms of high altitude sickness. With the oxygen saturation as low as 30, there was no option but to drop down to the base camp.
As they reached the base camp on 31, the weather started to get worse. That gave Kili Pemba and Mingma G some time to recover after a few brutal days on the mountain.
It also gave them the time to celebrate the arrival of the new year before heading back up the mountain. That was also the day that Mingma G and Nimsdai decided to climb as one team: Team Nepal.
“We had a lot to drink that day. We bonded over booze,” says Mingma G, laughing.
That day, Nimsdai even proposed starting the summit bid on January 2. But, with the team members tired and bad weather incoming, Minmga G convinced Nimsdai to wait for a better window.
“He was worried that the foreign climbers would acclimatise and follow us to the top. I was too. But, we were in no shape or form ready for the summit push and with bad weather looming, he agreed.”
That wait gave him and Nimsdai and the eight other climbers enough time to recover. The weather got horribly bad too during that time, creating doubt among the climbers.
Winds of up to 50 mph were recorded at the base camp from January 1 to 7. As the weather cleared, the Nepali team then started to plan when to move.
First, they had to go up to the high camps to check the state of equipment they had left for the summit push. Nimsdai’s team left for camp 2 on January 10 to ensure their equipment was okay. Sadly, the wind blew most of it away, including Nimsdai’s paragliding gear.
Mingma G, who had left it at around 7,300 metres was hopeful that his gear was safe, and gladly it was.
“We had dug a pit and put everything in it. It was a good decision. If we had lost that, our expedition was over.”
Losing the paragliding gear did not deter Nimsdai who continued to carry on. The next plan was to summit on the 15. Nimsdai’s team was to leave a day early while Mingma G’s team would join them at camp 2 before they pushed for the summit on 15.
But, the weather window kept changing and the summit day kept shifting.
By January 13, all 10 climbers had left the base camp and were a few hundred metres below camp 3. There, they started to get conflicting news about the weather. Nimsdai and Chhang Dawa’s weather report suggested they should not climb camp 3 on 14. But Mingma G’s weather report said otherwise.
“Ours, provided by Krishna Manandhar, showed clear weather above camp 3. I was worried that day because I knew if we didn’t move that day, our summit bid would be over as we didn’t know what conditions to expect beyond camp 3. Even the Russians didn’t have proper information beyond camp 3.”
On January 14, Mingma G woke up early as did Nimsdai. Both were on the radio about pushing towards camp 3 as the weather was good. They got nothing from Chhang Dawa from the base camp, and as the weather started to get better, they risked and pushed to camp 3 to fix ropes to camp 4.
That was the same day Snorri, Sadpara and his son were also on their way up. But, as their weather report said bad weather, they stayed at camp 2. When they tried to climb on, the winds stopped them from doing so.
“They had winds at camp 2, we had great weather at camp 3. It was like the mountain gods telling us to have K2 all to ourselves.”
But, the plan to summit on 15 took another hit as they had to fix ropes to camp 4 which was no easy task.
“In the summer, it takes you four hours to reach camp 4 from 3, but in the winter, we got lost. We encountered crevasse after crevasse, after which we decided to climb a near-vertical wall, through which we could reach camp 4. When we reached camp 4, it didn’t look like camp 4. It looked different.”
That he says was the most challenging day on the expedition. Climbing the vertical wall in hard snow, fixing ropes in freezing conditions certainly tested their metal. Mingma G for most parts of the day was leading the pitch and by the time he neared, camp 4 was knackered. Realising that, he asked someone else to do it and Mingma Tenji fixed the last 50 metres to camp 4.
VIDEO
“As we fixed ropes to camp 4. We were assured that K2 was ours. There was no way we would let it slip.”
After fixing the rope, he returned to camp 3, excited and anxious about the next day. Mingma G knew that the summit of K2, where he had stood before, was at a touching distance. Coming down, they had planned to start the summit push at around 11 pm on the 15th. But they only reached camp 3 at around 5: 30 pm and realised that they needed to rest for at least six hours before the big day.
“We were shattered. We had worked very hard. I had planned to climb without supplemental oxygen, but as I was knackered, I decided to not risk it and climb with it.”
The day was upon them: D-day. As they knew that the weather would be generally clear with mild wind, they started the summit push at around 2:45 am on 16. But soon, the cold started to get the best of it. Moving slowly, they continued to climb. Up to camp 3, they were fine. But, as they reached camp 4, which was like an open meadow of snow, the wind started to get them, testing their resolve.
“We were moving so slow. My feet were freezing. There was a time I thought about turning back. I even called Dawa Tenzing, but he didn’t respond. Had he responded, it would have been over; I’m glad he didn’t”
All 10 had decided beforehand that they would wait for one another 10 metres below the summit and walk to it, arm in arm, like brothers, singing the national anthem.
“It was a great gesture, was an extremely emotional moment for all of us. When we reached the summit, we were happy, ecstatic. But, more than that, we were relieved. We had done it. We had climbed K2 and completed the last great mountaineering adventure.”
At base camp, they got a hero’s welcome. In Pakistan, they were treated like royalties. The part did not end there. When they arrived in Nepal, they were treated like kings.
“This is bigger than the world cup,” said Nimsdai at an event.
He is right. This was. They did not just climb for themselves, they did this for Nepal and most important for all, their fellow climbers. All they have all wanted was recognition from the world. And, on January 16, 2021, the world took notice.
“I know it might sound cocky, but this does prove that we are the best high-altitude climbers in the world. People can say that we were lucky. But, that doesn’t hide that we have etched our name in the mountaineering hall of fame.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepalis-on-k2-mingma-g.html,travel
Exploring Lamjung on cycle: A meaningful and fun-filled journey,"Saturday, February 13, 2021","What a meaningful journey it was to Lamjung. Exploring the district as we pedalled the bicycle was a whole exciting experience this time.
We started our journey with a goal to enjoy cycling along hilly trails. We cycled there for about two months with the intention to explore the unexplored.
At the very beginning of the journey, we reached Puranokot of Lamjung. We passed the path enjoying the scenic beauty of the mountains and hills. Puranokot was one of the Chaubise principalities in the past and carries historical significance.
There are the ruins of the palace of King Kalu Shah in Puranokot. As mentioned in history, Kalu Shah was the king of Lamjung. The second son of the King Kul Mandan, he was brought from Kaski and made the king of Turlungkot. Later, the palace was shifted to Puranokot.
Just below the Puranokot fort is the Puranokot village. There, a homestay facility has also been brought into operation since 2011. One can reach the historical fort in an hour and a half by bus from Sundar Bazaar of Lamjung. The view of the village and the clear mountains from the fort looks stunning. Machhapuchhre, Annapurna, Lamjung Peak 29, Gangapurna, Manaslu, Buddha, and other mountains can be seen from there.
Besides this scenic beauty, Puranokot has much more to offer to the visitors. There is Jaldevi temple, ruins of Rajarani palace, and an army parade ground in Puranokot. However, the palace is surrounded by weeds and is untidy.
There are many attractive places with tourism potential in Lamjung like Lamjung Durbar, Dura Danda, Tumlung fort, Halo Kranti, and Ghale Gaun. There are also palaces in Gaunshahar and Besishahar, which were built by King Kalu’s younger brother Yashobrahma. Like his brother, he was also brought from Kaski after King Kalu’s assassination and made the king of Ranokot.
The friendly demeanour of the locals also makes the visitor cheerful. However, the construction and promotion of infrastructure in the area have not been relatively good. Places of importance have not been properly maintained and protected by the local authority.
We managed to roam around all these places of Lamjung during our stay. The most fun part of the journey was cycling from Lamjung Durbar to Ghale Gaun (29 km). Overall, the journey to Lamjung was very meaningful and exciting.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/exploring-lamjung-on-cycle-a-meaningful-and-fun-filled-journey.html,travel
"Visiting Khaptad, the Crown of the Far-west, once is not enough. Here’s why","Saturday, February 6, 2021","Khaptad National Park is a popular ​​choice for domestic tourists. Also called the Crown of the Far-west, it is spread across Bajhang, Bajura, Doti and Achham districts.
I first visited Khaptad in 2011. No matter how many times I visit Khaptad, I still feel like going back every time; it calms my soul.
This time was my fifth trip to Khaptad, and I found it particularly enjoyable because of the cold weather. Commonly, this time of the year in Khaptad is snowy and chilly but when I reached, there was no speck of snow.
Khaptad a suitable destination not only for its natural beauty but also for its prospects in religious tourism. It is considered a holy place with plenty of mythological references. Somewhere, it is also referred to as Khecharadi Parvat. Here, many sages including Khaptad Baba once meditated.
Some of the major tourist attractions here include Khaptad Baba’s Kuti, Triveni River, Khappar Pond, Shiva Temple, Sahasralinga, Ganeshsthan, Nagdhunga, and Kedardhunga among others.
Khaptad National Park is located at a height of around 3,000 metres above the sea level, with a total area of 225 square kilometres. There are 22, big and small, grasslands and 53 small hills inside Khaptad that are its main attractions.
From Khaptad, Api and Saipal mountains can also be seen nearby.
On the first day of the trek, some people stay in Bichpaani and those who can walk a little more reach the Triveni Temple.
However, tourists lack proper accommodation in the Khaptad area. For now, accommodation is being arranged in joint collaboration of the Nepal Tourism Board and the Department of National Parks. The construction of a house with a capacity to accommodate 100 people a day is underway in the area. I am also involved in the project on behalf of the Nepal Tourism Board.
The construction work is satisfactory despite the geographical adversities and adverse weather conditions. We expect the work to be completed by mid-July.
With the contractor’s action plan and commitment, we hope the tourists will get proper facilities to eat and stay, starting the next season. With this, we also hope that the number of tourists in Khaptad region will increase significantly.
At present, a homestay facility has also started its service in Jigrana, the entrance of Khaptad National Park. Khaptad Homestay has also brought a heli-tour package to promote the Khaptad region.
It brought the package after it became impossible to reach Khaptad on foot and by road because of the snowfall.
There are five options to reach Khaptad by helicopter. The packages start from Rs 8,000 for the helicopter tour from Jhingrana to Khaptad, for 10,000 from Dipayal to Khaptad and Rs 30,000 from Dhangadhi to Khaptad.
In another package, you can fly from Dhangadhi to Dipayal before beginning the journey to Khaptad including a two-day meal and accommodation. It costs Rs 21,500. There is another package of Rs 15,000 for going from Dhangadhi to Dipayal by land and from there to Khaptad, says the homestay’s managing director Deepak Khadka.
He has targeted welcoming 300 tourists under these packages.
Dhangadhi is 650 kilometres away from Kathmandu. It takes about eight hours of travel by bus from Dhangadhi to Silgadhi of Doti. Then, it takes another hour of travel on a jeep from Silgadhi to the Khaptad National Park entrance.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/visiting-khaptad-the-crown-of-the-far-west-once-is-not-enough-heres-why.html,travel
Nepali mountaineers cancel Manaslu summit bid,"Friday, February 5, 2021","Kathmandu, February 5
Nepali mountaineers Vinayak Jaya Malla and Tenji Sherpa have decided to discontinue their bid to climb Manalsu this year.
Both internationally certified mountain guides (IFMGA), Sherpa and Malla arrived in Gorkha district late in December 2020 to attempt to climb the eighth highest mountain in the world in the alpine style.
The team trekked, experienced the arrival of winter and broke the trail to the base camp through heavy snow early in January, paving the path for others who followed.
The duo, however, hit a brick wall on the way to Camp II where they encountered an impassable crevasse at around 6,200 m on January 27 along the standard route on the Northeast Ridge.
“We are quite gutted,” says Malla. “We tried a lot to get around the crevasse but it was just not possible. With the weather expected to get worse, we decided to call off our expedition.”
Malla says that if they were using fixed ropes, there might have been a chance for the summit, but with the duo attempting it in the alpine style, they decided it was better to call off their climbing bid and head home.
With elements beyond their control, the snow conditions and the forecast ahead, the team is walking off the mountain safely ascertaining that the alpine style (no fixed ropes, fast and light climbing) on Manaslu is not possible this season.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepali-mountaineers-cancel-manaslu-summit-bid.html,travel

4 most interesting and challenging golf holes in Nepal,"Monday, January 25, 2021","You may be surprised to learn that golf in Nepal is not just a Sunday afternoon game. Since 1993, when the Surya Nepal Masters Open began and the world saw how beautiful Nepal is, it has been an attraction for both professional and amateur golfers from all over the world.
Whether you are travelling for business or travelling purely for the pleasure of golfing here, Nepal’s golf courses are a sight to behold. Like any country, it has its regular courses, and then it has its beauts.
Let’s rediscover Nepal’s golf courses as gems for golfers who want to visit this beautiful country to swing their clubs.
If you ask any person what comes to mind when you say “Nepal”, if they are not saying “temples”, chances are they are talking about the Himalayas. It goes without saying, then, that the Himalayan Golf Course should be first up.
This course is truly a unique one. The entire course was built by hand, using sledgehammers to break rocks and carve this course out of the countryside. It took five years to finish.
Regularly named one of the most unique courses in the world, the fairways and greens are nestled in a ravine, with the clubhouse, opening and closing holes at the top, 250 feet up.
The golf itself is suitable for amateurs and pros alike, but that is not what you will take home with you. Your memories will be of the steep ravine walls, eagles flying overhead, and the sound of waterfalls gushing into the Himalayan river below.
If you thought the scenery of the first course was magnificent, wait for this one. Designed in 1999, it was Nepal’s first full 18-hole golf course, and hosts the Surya Nepal Masters Open.
You will be backed by spectacular snow-covered mountains as you meander through part of the Gokarna forest, which is ancient and the sheer size of the trees you will pass is evidence of that. Your first through holes will lead you through the trees, which can be challenging for amateurs.
You will emerge from the forest into the flats, and the biggest challenge—the 225-yard, par-3 8th hole—will be waiting.
You may be lucky enough to catch a sighting of a monkey in the forest, common deer, or a rare Indian Flying Fox gliding from tree to tree.
This nine-hole course is located at the Fulbari Resort. It is a private course, but if you are there in the off-season, you are likely to be able to play one round.
The course is situated on the top of a hill, overlooking the beautiful but intimidating Seti River gorge. We have yet to hear reports of a real yeti being found, but keep an eye out anyway!
This course used to be called the Gauchar Golf Club and began back in 1917 with an astounding 36 holes. It began as a golf course for royalty, namely King Tribhuvan Shah and his sons.
Over the years, as the nearby airport expanded, the golf course became smaller and smaller. It was renamed in 1965, and finally finished remodelling in 1989.
The nine-hole course is challenging and hosts almost 30 annual tournaments. It is lined with trees and has a stream running through it.
If you are not checking prices for plane tickets to Nepal, you should be! The golf is superb, but that is not the only amazing thing about this country.
If you are lucky enough to be around for a few days, immerse yourself in the culture and learn as much as you can. Get a taste of local cuisine, view some of the scenery from somewhere other than the course, and revisit your own spirituality.
Do not underestimate this stunning country. Even if all you do while you are here is hit golf balls, you cannot miss the beauty and atmosphere.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/most-interesting-and-challenging-golf-holes-in-nepal.html,travel

Majestic Makalu trek: Blend of natural beauty and warm hospitality,"Saturday, January 23, 2021","“Take nothing but memories, leave nothing but footprints!” – Chief Seattle
Travelling allows one to experience moments that can turn into lifelong memories. Everything one sees, experiences and absorbs during the trip, stays with them. Visiting Makalu-Barun National Park in Sankhuwasabha is one such exciting and memorable trip. Travelling through vehicles or on foot, up and down the roads, started a new chapter of life.
One can start the journey from Itahari, Dharan or Dhankuta till Num. These are the more preferred routes as people can travel easily on vehicles. From Num, the road goes downhill to the bank of Arun. Across the river starts the walking journey at the height of about 700 metres above the sea level.
Once they reach Seduwa, travellers can rest for a while and eat for the next part of the journey. From there, the next stop is Tashi village which lies at the height of 2,100 metres above the sea level.
This welcoming village always seems ready to serve the guests. Its good food and warm hospitality ensure travellers leave with good memories. The villagers even provide necessary guidance and assure accommodation for those in need.
The second day of the journey takes one till Khongma. This path is a very steep uphill. Recently, the villagers have paved stones on the trail artistically. When the tired travellers reach Khongma, Saili didi’s finger-licking food helps forget all their lethargy.
The third part of travelling gets more special because the travellers come across two mesmerising water bodies, one small and another big. They are situated at 4,200 metres above the sea level. The view is soothing to the eyes, and once is not enough to take in its beauty.
Once travellers cross the water bodies and the Septen-La Pass, they start their journey downhill, and they reach the Barun river. There is a three-hour walk along the riverside till Yang Kharka and you can spend the night there.
The next day, from Yang Kharka, travellers go more downhill to the religious site, Shivadhara. It is believed that parents who have been unable to conceive and wish for a child here get their wish fulfilled.
Another six hours of the walk take you to Langmaale, at an altitude of 4500 metres. The majestic view of the Himalayan Range washes away any or all tired feeling travellers feel. Like the cattle grazing in the field, the travellers also would want to spend their time there and nowhere else. Mornings at Langmaale is filled with sun-kissed peaks of the Range.
On the last day, travellers reach the Makalu base camp. This part of the trek is all filled with snowy, white peaks and another lake that lies on the way. It is a four-hour walk till the base camp and you can find the majestic Makalu peak welcoming you, cheering.
From the base of the peak, travellers can see the Udram Lake and other smaller ponds with their source, Barun river. Another attraction is that Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) is also visible from the viewpoint. There are many open spaces or fields for one to camp out.
The complete journey to Makalu-Barun area is truly an enriching, and once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience. From mesmerising natural beauty to welcoming villagers and good accommodation for food and lodging with easy roads, Makalu-Barun is a complete package for all travellers.
May be due to lack of popularity, the Makalu base camp is still untouched and unpolluted, because of which, it is still enjoyable and mesmerising.
Though the area was only earlier visited by foreign travellers, lately, it is being noticed by domestic travellers too. In 2020 alone, about 1,000 domestic tourists visited the area, locals say.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/majestic-makalu-trek-blend-of-natural-beauty-and-warm-hospitality.html,travel

"Benthanchok: Close to Kathmandu, this destination offers you mesmirising views of sunrise and mountains","Saturday, January 16, 2021","Bethanchok, a hilltop situated on the southern hills of Kavrepalanchok, is not so far from Kathmandu. The scenic spot can be reached with a short trek from the city. However, for us, circumstances were not right or appropriate to plan for travelling to Bethanchok.
But, still, the desire to escape from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu and wander in the open space was suppressed deep down in our hearts. Once, it was proposed to go to Bethanchok during a talk with friends. The friends unanimously approved the proposal. Then, we were ready to leave Kathmandu for Bethanchok.
However, the journey to Bethanchok was not as smooth and easy as we had thought. We had to suffer a lot to reach the hilltop. Throughout the journey, we thought this would be the last trip to Bethanchok, we would not go there again.
But, when we got to the hilltop, the hardships of the journey suddenly disappeared. Our minds were filled with excitement.
Then, we spent the night there only. As the eastern horizon reddened with the sun, we positioned the lens of our camera in the same direction. Therefore, we did not miss capturing that precious scene on our camera.
Our journey started at Jagati in Bhaktapur. From there, we travelled about 70 kilometres to the place. We travelled on a vehicle to Dhunkharka via Jagati, Banepa, Panauti, and Khopasi. After that, we walked to reach the hilltop.
It took around six hours to reach the hilltop on foot. When we reached Bethanchok, we did not see much as it was almost dark. But, when we saw the view in the morning, we thought that this was the paradise on the earth. From that height, the scenes around or below there were truly mesmerising.

Nepali mountaineers, Nirmal Purja Magar (Nimsdai), Mingma Gyalji Sherpa, Sona Sherpa, Kilu Sherpa and seven other mountaineers have fixed ropes up to 7,600 metres on K2 in the Karakoram range in Pakistan.
Nimsdai via Instagram confirmed that he along with other Nepali mountaineers reached up to 7,600 metres fixing ropes and would spend the night a little above Camp 3 at 7,400 metres.
“The last 48 hours have been gruelling,” he wrote on Instagram. “Each team member had to carry over 35 kgs as we fixed ropes till 7,600 metres and set up camp at 7,350 metres. Really proud of the work we (Mingma G and team and Seven Summit Team) have done so far.”
They had to reestablish Camp 3 after it was destroyed by high winds and snow the last week. According to Alan Arnette‘s blog, the teams spent the night at crevasses and not tents.
There have also been reports of rockfall on the mountain, but the mountaineers say things are okay now. The summit bid, according to Arnette’s blog, is expected to be on Saturday as the weather is expected to get worst next week.
If the Nepali teams get to the summit, they will be the first to climb K2 in the winter.
Mingma G Sherpa is climbing without supplemental oxygen whereas Nimsdai is planning to paraglide from the summit. However, that is subject to change given high winds and unpredictable weather.
K2 remains the only 8,000-metre mountain yet to be summited in the winter.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/k2-climbing-nepal-teams-fix-ropes-to-7600-m-wait-for-good-weather-for-summit-bid.html,travel
Travelling for fishing? Here are 4 best places in Nepal,"Sunday, January 10, 2021","Nepal is not exactly known for its fishing scene. If you think of Nepal, most often, it is known for its beautiful and intimidating mountains (of which it hosts eight of the ten highest in the world).
But, with over 100 different species of fish in the waters around Nepal, fisherfolk will never be bored here!
The bonus? You will be out on the serene water, surrounded by the magnificent mountainous, jungle scenery that Nepal is known for.
The best time to fish is between the monsoon seasons. Head to any one of these spots from February to May (springtime), and October to November (autumn) for the chance to battle a fish in the serene mountain environment.
Here are our choices for the best places in Nepal to fish.
Don’t miss your chance to fish on the longest river in Nepal. At 315 miles long, there are plenty of fishing spots along the Karnali river, where your chances to catch large fish are good.
But, our top choice spot is Seti Karnali where the Karnali meets the Seti tributary. The Seti river itself is 107 miles long, and also has a variety of fishing spots. You can float down the river on a float tube as you fish, which gives you an opportunity to marvel at the beautiful scenery as you pass.
You can fish for unique species like the Golden Mahseer and the Silver Mahseer (also called the Indian salmon). Although catch-and-release is encouraged, the Mahseer is a tasty fish to cook, so you could catch your own dinner! They are endangered, so take only one.
You will have the best luck using a spinning rod and reel with a monofilament line with a weight of up to 40 pounds. Choose brightly coloured spinners that are on the larger side.
This river is also home to the Gangetic river dolphin, which is the largest freshwater mammal on the Indian subcontinent. Keep an eye out for one while you are fishing!
Inside the city of Pokhara are a couple of lakes that offer great fishing opportunities. Phewa (or Fewa) lake and Begnas lake are both stunning clear lakes that have amazing mountain backdrops.
Phewa lake is a great fishing spot, but it is also a wonderful place for families to spend a day together. There are kayaks and boats for hire, a market nearby, and many restaurants nearby. It is tourist-oriented, so it can get busy.
Although this lake is often crowded with people, it is so big that it is not difficult to find a more peaceful spot where you can fish away from other people. There is also a temple in the middle of Phewa Lake, so you can have a spiritual experience.
Begnas lake is much quieter and is about 10 miles outside of Pokhara. It is relatively untouched, so if you want a more relaxed fishing experience with a solitary feel, Begnas Lake is the better choice.
In both of these lakes, you will be able to catch Mahseer, common carp, catfish, sahar, katle, asla, and others. Most restaurants in the Pokhara area have Phewa Lake fish on their menus!
About 45 miles outside of Kathmandu, you will find the Balephi river. This whitewater can be challenging to fish as it is a narrow and fast-flowing river. It is a well-known destination for whitewater rafting and kayaking, but the fishing can be great here too.
Similar to other rivers and lakes in Nepal, the fish you are most likely to catch here are the Golden Mahseer and the catfish. You may also find trout, carp, or common Mahseer on the end of your line.
This is a prime fishing spot for those who may enjoy adventuring as well as fishing. You can go whitewater rafting to get your adrenaline pumping or explore the surroundings for a more relaxed activity.
If you do choose to fly fish in the river, be careful as the narrow nature of the river means you may get your line caught in the trees on the bank. Also, watch out for whitewater rafters while you are casting!
Fishing in the Tamor river gives you the opportunity to catch some more unusual species. The Tamor is a quiet river and has not been fished as much as others. Therefore, the fish population continues to grow, and it makes for an exciting day’s fishing.
You may catch river loaches, the Nepali minnow, catfish, Himalayan trout, asala, and the trophy catfish, known as goonch.
Catching a goonch is the ultimate dream for many anglers fishing in these waters. These monster fish present a challenge, both mental and physical. They are extremely muscular and heavy and have a habit of planting themselves in the river’s bed, between rocks so they cannot be moved.
If you are after one of these big fish, you will need to prepare yourself and use a braided line for extra strength. By all accounts, the lure you use is of no consequence – if the goonch is not hungry, it will not bite, no matter how appealing your bait is.
Even if the goonches are not biting, your chances of catching other fish are good. A day on these waters is worth it even if you get no bite, simply for the spectacular views of Mount Everest and Mount Makalu.
Nepal is so much more than just mountains, jungles, and spiritual enlightenment. If you are a fisher, you will find these waters to be interesting and challenging, and you will have a chance of catching some large and unusual fish.
Anyway, the scenery in Nepal is so beautiful that fishing is a great reason to spend some time outdoors, surrounded by its amazing nature. It is also a good activity to do if you want some alone time, or if you are looking for something fun and educational to do with the family!
Whatever your reason for getting out your rod and reel, fishing in Nepal is much more than you may expect.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/travelling-for-fishing-here-are-best-places-in-nepal.html,travel
Kathmandu-Jakarta direct flights likely after June,"Friday, January 8, 2021","Kathmandu, January 8
Preparations are underway to connect Kathmandu and Jakarta, capitals of Nepal and Indonesia respectively, via direct flights beginning June or July this year.
The national flag carrier of Indonesia, Garuda Indonesia, is preparing to fly to the Tribhuvan International Airport from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
The company has already picked Society International Travel Service as its general sales agent for Kathmandu flights. The agent company’s operation department chief Sangita Rauniyar says the flights are likely after around six months.
Meanwhile, there is also a plan to fly Nepal’s national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation also, to Jakarta. As per its 10-year business plan, the NAC hopes to fly to Jakarta among other destinations from 2023.
Of late, Indonesia has emerged as a favourite destination for Nepalis for holiday. Indonesia also provides the on-arrival visa facility for Nepalis. So far, people travelling between the two countries have been forced to take flights via Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia.

"Nepal had targeted welcoming 2 million foreign tourists in 2020, but figure hit historic low","Thursday, January 7, 2021","Kathmandu, January 7
Before the Covid-19 crisis hit the country, the government of Nepal was much excited about its ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign that had targeted welcoming two million foreign tourists in a year.
However, the pandemic shattered the government’s dream and it had to call off the campaign as early as in March. As the year ended now, Nepal has got frustrating data about tourist arrivals in the country.
The Department of Immigration says 230,085 foreigners came to Nepal for tourism in 2020. This is the lowest for the past 34 years. in 1986, only 223,331 foreign tourists had visited the country.
The recent low figure was in 2015 in the wake of the devastating earthquake. However, that year also, Nepal had welcomed over 538,000 tourists.

Pokhara has one more adventure for tourists: Tower climbing,"Wednesday, December 30, 2020","Kathmandu, December 30
Nepal’s tourism capital has one more adventure for tourists travelling in the city. A tower climbing facility will soon come into operation near the Mountain Museum at Ratopaira, Pokhara-17.
Bungee Nepal Adventures Pvt Ltd will provide tower climbing opportunities on its 35-metre bungee tower there, according to the company’s chairperson Santosh Bhattarai.
One has to pay Rs 1,000 to climb the tower. The company will provide the necessary equipment for the climb. If they want their photographs also, the adventurers will have to pay Rs 200 more. In addition, there will be packages for birthday and wedding anniversary celebrations among others.
The tower is designed in such a way that the tourists can also take rest halfway if they feel tired, according to him.

"2 climbers in bid to become 1st all-Nepali team to scale an 8,000-metre peak in winter","Monday, December 28, 2020","Sitting at a cafe in Bouddha, Vinayak Jaya Malla and Tenji Sherpa are planning for one of their greatest mountaineering adventures yet. There is a hint of excitement in their eyes, also a bit of anxiousness, as they believe they have what it takes to become the first all-Nepali team to climb an 8000-metre peak in the winter.
In a bid to do that, the duo are on their way to Manaslu base camp where they will spend the next month acclimatising and training. To make things interesting, they are going to climb the eighth highest mountain in the world in the alpine style, that means no fixed camps, no fixed ropes and no bottled oxygen.
“We’ve wanted to do this for a while now. But, due to other commitments, we could not do it,” says Malla. “This year, due to Covid-19, all our other plans were put on hold and as we had the time, we felt why not head to Manaslu and climb it.”
The last team to climb Manaslu in the winter was back in 1998 when Young-Seok Park along with Kami Dorchi Sherpa and Ang Dawa Tamang reached the summit. Since then, there have been a few attempts, but due to high winds, bad weather and heavy snow, no one has been able to summit in the winter.
“That wasn’t an all-Nepali team. We want to create history by becoming the first,” says Sherpa.
Apart from wanting to be the first Nepali team to climb an 8,000-er, they also want to spread a message that a winter climb is also possible in Nepal.
“Many of us and our friends work during two seasons, spring and autumn, and do nothing during winter. If we can do this, we can promote another season with a hope that adventurers will come and climb Nepali mountains in the winter,” says Sherpa.
The reason they decide to go with Manaslu is that they believe that it is one of the easy 8,000 metre-peaks to climb.
“Cho Oyu is the easiest, then it’s Manaslu. We can’t call these peaks easy, but compared to other mountains in Nepal, Manaslu is doable,” says Malla.
That said, they are aware of the challenges ahead. It is going to be very windy, the weather changes frequently, and it is going to snow a lot in January. But, the duo are prepared to take on the challenge.
In order to stay fit, acclimatise, and get ready, they will be climbing peaks close to Manaslu. As they will be climbing in the alpine style, they know that practice is key.
Sherpa has prior experience of alpinism in Nepal. In 2015, he was Ueli Steck’s rope partner when the duo summited Cholatse. And, he says that the experience of climbing with Steck will come in handy now.
“We’ll have ropes connecting us and protection in between. Whoever is ahead will add protection like ice screws, snow bars and rock protection and the one behind will remove them. Teamwork is going to be important here,” says Malla.
While there has been a talk that this could be the start of alpinism in Nepal, both feel that current rules and regulations are not favourable for it. They say that the government has only been pushing for commercial expeditions so far.
“The need of a guide on every mountain has forced people to go commercial and I don’t blame them,” says Malla.
Another major challenge the duo faced while planning the expedition was funding. All the equipment that they need has to be brought abroad. While people like Nimsdai have had sponsors in the past, the two found it quite hard.
“No brand will sponsor us because Nepal isn’t that big a market for them. We were glad that Nimsdai helped us out a bit. This project is funded by us and us alone,” says Malla.
But, they are hopeful that if they can achieve this feat, companies will believe in them and sponsor them in future expeditions.
“We have to show why they should sponsor us,” says Sherpa. “I hear a lot of people saying they don’t have sponsors. But, you’re not going to get a sponsor by sitting in Kathmandu. Ask Nimsdai how he managed to get his sponsors.”
Not having a sponsor has not stopped the duo who want to prove another point to the mountaineering community. When going abroad, they say people often tell them that even though they are powerful in the mountains, technically they are weak.
“We are the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA)-certified guides. We know what technical climbing is,” says Sherpa. “We want to prove that we are technical climbers, that we can climb in the alpine style. We want to break this stereotype about Nepali climbers and in doing so, put some respect in our name.”
And they have support from the Nepali climbing community who want them to complete this historic feat.
“Everyone is rooting for us. They like what we are trying to do. If we do this, it’ll be for everyone,” says Malla. “We’re young climbers who want to inspire a new generation to climb. Climb in a different way. Maybe this is for the best.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/2-climbers-in-bid-to-become-1st-all-nepali-team-to-scale-an-8000-metre-peak-in-winter.html,travel
New coronavirus variant disappoints Nepal tourism industry,"Friday, December 25, 2020","Kathmandu, December 25
Rajendra Sapkota, a tourism entrepreneur of Nepal, is worried again these days. The country’s tourism industry seriously hit by the Covid-19 pandemic since March this year was slowly reviving, but it has received a halt again.
“Without substantial income, we have lost millions of rupees this year,” he questions, “How long will it continue now?”
Tourism businesspersons including Sapkota are concerned over international travel restrictions triggered by the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus in the United Kingdom recently. Alarmed by the threats in the UK, the government of Nepal has also imposed a restriction on the entry of tourists from and via the country.
“Tourists seeking adventures would not be stopped by the pandemic, but now, no one can help them since their way has been blocked,” Sapkota says.
His concern is valid as the UK had been one of the biggest source countries for foreign tourists visiting Nepal in the past five months.
With the emergence of the new variant of the virus, some tourists expected to visit Nepal in the next few weeks have begun cancelling their tickets and hotel bookings.
Therefore, the businesses are unable to think about what they should do next, laments Binayak Shah, the first vice-president of Hotel Association Nepal.
He reveals many hotels have begun laying off staff with various schemes in the past few months. “Here is a situation that we cannot employ the human resources who would otherwise make us earn thousands of rupees every month. Therefore, we have announced schemes letting them explore other options.”
Meanwhile, domestic airline companies have reported a decrease in their income owing to the lack of foreign passengers.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/new-coronavirus-variant-disappoints-nepal-tourism-industry.html,travel

Surkhet is not only a gateway to Rara. These are the places you should visit there,"Saturday, December 19, 2020","Surkhet is the capital of the Karnali province. This is not the only identity of this place. Also, this beautiful valley is the gateway to many famous tourist destinations of Nepal such as Rara lake, Shey-Phoksundo lake, Limi valley and Bulbule lake.
Surkhet is a unique confluence of natural beauty and cultural heritage. Here are some of the places that one must not miss visiting in and around the Surkhet valley.
is one of the major tourist attractions of this place as well as the western Nepal which is just a 15 minutes’ drive from Surkhet Bazaar. This temple has just been reconstructed.
Located in the middle of the dense forest, this stone temple is a common pilgrimage site for both Buddhists and Hindus. Also, visitors can get to see the artistic stone sculptures here.
There is a custom of taking vows by raising the flag at this temple.
Another attraction of Surkhet is Bulbule lake. It has been popular mainly among domestic visitors. Considering this lake as the major tourist centre, the Surkhet Upatyaka Nagar Vikas Samiti has constructed artistic structures including a playground for children, picnic spot and taps here.
Locals say that the lake, which was very wide in the past, is now shrinking. At present, under the master plan, it is planned to expand the lake area to another around 27,000 square feet of land.
After reaching Surkhet, one can also have an exciting experience of paragliding. From the paragliders flying in the open sky above the Surkhet valley, one can view the valley from different angles. One can take a paragliding flight from Gothidanda of the valley.
Although paragliding flights have been arranged targeting domestic tourists, its flight has been postponed for some time now. Nevertheless, one can also enjoy rafting on the Bheri river.
“This place has a special significance as it is the capital of the Karnali province. Even from an administrative point of view, the numbers of those coming to Surkhet valley (Birendranagar) is high.
At the same time, the number of people migrating here is also very high. Considering all of these things, we have to manage everything from building physical infrastructures to other things.
As of now, the municipality is focused on road extension and reconstruction. Also, we are making special preparations to make Surkhet an administrative centre and a tourist destination. Our plan is to manage the tourist facilities here along with the transport facilities. Along with Kankrebihar, another major temple, Deuti Bajyai, is also being reconstructed.

Tourism activities on the rise in Sauraha,"Thursday, December 17, 2020","Chitwan, December 17
The tourism industry of Sauraha in Chitwan, which was battered in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic almost for a year, has gradually started revitalising.

Hotels based in touristic sites in Myagdi, which remained closed for the past nine months, have reopened today. Similarly, religious shrines are also open.

Mera Peak ascent: The thrill of a lifetime,"Saturday, December 12, 2020","Born and brought up in the mountainous Humla district, mountains were always close to my view. Those mountains kept calling me since my birth. I always had a wish to climb a peak.
However, I never got that opportunity until recently when I decided to climb Mera Peak (6,456 metres) in Mahakulung rural municipality of Solukhumbhu, in Province 1. It has been classified as a trekking peak, and you are not required to have past experience to climb it.
On my way to Mera Peak, foreign mountaineers shared their climbing stories with me. And, that intrigued me a lot. While listening to them, I tried to imagine what it would feel like to step onto the snow over the mountains.
Usually, it takes three weeks to climb Mero Peak. However, pro climbers complete it in two weeks.
During the ascent, five to seven people had to line up with the same rope. At times, It became so harsh. Also, it was very sad when our friends had to go back halfway as they could not climb further. There was a risk in every step. If only a single thing had gone wrong or happened against our planning during the ascent, we could have ended up losing our lives. It was significant to take care of one’s health during the ascent.
My experience was exactly the opposite of what I had imagined earlier. What I experienced after returning from the mountain was that climbing a mountain was not as easy as I had thought, as others had recited in their tales, as others had seen in the newspapers. But, it is no less adventurous to play hide and seek with the harshness of the mountains and reach the peak.
The day I finally reached the peak struggling with so many difficulties, I experienced the thrill of a lifetime. Even after returning from there, that moment continued to give me a different kind of happiness and enthusiasm. Even now, remembering those moments makes the mind delighted.
It is not that I had never done any adventure before. I am an avid adventurer by nature. However, mountaineering was something different. It was surreal, I felt like there could not be any bigger adventure than this. The struggle and the risk to reach the mountain peak, and the immense happiness after reaching the peak… Ah, what a thrill!
According to Jangbu Sherpa, the manager of Refuge Mera Lodge, climbers consider Mera Peak a bit comfortable or easier to climb compared to other mountains. Probably, that is why many foreigners used to flock here in the past years. However, Mera Peak is seen deserted this year, all due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Some Nepali climbers did come to Mera peak this year. Targeting domestic visitors (Nepalis), a separate package from Kathmandu to Mera Peak was made public this year, costing Rs 50,000. This expenditure is more to motivate Nepalis to climb mountains rather than to make some money.
Also, there are hundreds of mountaineering companies in Nepal alone. But, the owner of the company has little experience in climbing. Therefore, the package is also brought for them to collect some mountaineering experience.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mera-peak-ascent-the-thrill-of-a-lifetime.html,travel
Mountain Day: Covid-19 vaccines in Nepal a must to ensure mountaineering revival,"Friday, December 11, 2020","Nepal Mountaineering Association recently celebrated its 47th anniversary. The association since its formation in 1973 has been involved in the promotion of mountain tourism in the country. It also gives out permits to climbers who come to Nepal to climb various mountains. It has established a Mountaineering Training School in Manang where it provides theoretical and practical courses to new mountaineers. Along with that, it also provides memberships to mountaineers who have climbed 8,000-metre peaks and agencies who carry out expeditions on Nepali mountains. The association has also been carrying out rescues in the mountains that they provide permits to. Apart from that, it has also been actively protecting and cleaning the mountains.
On the occasion of International Mountaineering Day, Onlinekhabar caught up with the president of the NMA, Santa Bir Lama, to talk about his tenure as president, how Covid-19 affected mountain tourism in Nepal and what Nepal can do to ensure that there is a mountaineering season in 2021.
Excerpts:
Your term as the president of the NMA is ending soon. What have you achieved in the past three years?
I feel this has been a productive tenure. Firstly, we moved to a new building. Another achievement I would like to talk about is the work we did at the International Mountain Museum in Pokhara where we have constructed a few structures and a mountain garden to immortalise all the great Nepali and foreign climbers.
Apart from that, I have tried to fulfil all the promises I made when I took office. For example, I have made it easier for a climber to get a membership if they have climbed an 8,000-metre peak. There was a lot of nepotism when distributing membership, but I stopped that practice and made it fair for everyone. Lastly, I have been working with the government to establish a basket fund that can be used to clean mountains and to help the families of the deceased mountaineers.
How badly has Covid-19 affected mountaineering in Nepal?
It has been bad. Worse than in 2014 and 2015, I would say. None of us had faced such a disaster in our life. No one would have expected that this would have gone on for this long. Everyone had hoped that 2020 would have been better than 2019, but with Covid-19 spreading in the West like wildfire, it broke the backbone of not just the mountaineering industry but also the entire tourism industry.
We were lucky that some expeditions took place at Manaslu, Island Peak and Ama Dablam. Some friends also went climbing virgin peaks to see if they are possible for promotion. But, apart from that, nothing much happened. We had hoped the government would have helped, but sadly, nothing came from them.
How would you say the preparations have been for the future?
I think Nepal’s mountains are safe for tourists. When I talk to people involved in trekking and mountaineering, everyone has been saying that they have been taking measures and that they want to ensure safety for tourists coming into the country. Sanitisation is being taken quite seriously even in areas like Solukhumbu.
Nepali companies have said that they will put the climbing guides in two-week isolation before sending them to the expedition. They know how important it is to spread the message that Nepal is safe. Moreover, people who will come to Nepal will definitely be cautious. With the vaccine now being given in the West, it is likely that people will take them before leaving their respective countries.
What have agencies been telling you? What should be done to make mountaineering safe?
Everyone is looking forward to the next season. They have been saying that we are capable of pulling it off and have asked the government to open the country for tourism because it is an integral part of our economy. The government has also been telling us how they will slowly start giving on-arrival visa. That is why people are hopeful for 2021.
But, for that to happen, the government must ensure that the vaccine arrives in Nepal before spring 2021. If we can do that, I am sure Nepal will have a good mountaineering season.
We have also made membership more accessible to agencies who take expeditions to mountains listed under the NMA. We have also made another amendment to statute whereby from now on, a person can only be the president of the association once. We want new brains in the industry to take things forwards. We want people to use technology and stop autocracy. Under my presidency, we have also given scholarships to over 60 students, most of whose parents died in the mountains. Lastly, I have also stopped taking allowances from the association to start precedence because I want this organisation to be clean.
You have also emphasised a lot about cleaning Nepali mountains. How has that been?
It has been going good. But, I feel it can get a lot better. The Sagarmatha Cleaning Campaign was started by the NMA, after which the government started to take interest. We are still actively pushing to clean more mountains.  We also have been taking ‘cleaning deposits’ from climbers to ensure that they bring back 10 kgs waste back with them.
We have suggested the government make it non-refundable so that that fee can be used to clean other mountains. If we do that, the government and the NMA will no longer have to beg people for money, and it will also create jobs. The government has been positive about it.
There are demands that the government should stop making guides mandatory for smaller peaks. What do you think of this?
No. A guide is there for a reason. It is not just about a job being created but its also a matter of safety. I am sure people can climb a mountain without one, but having one will definitely help. It will also stop people dying on the mountains.
What about clearing corpses from the mountains?
It is not as easy as people make it out to be. We have been clearing bodies too. But, there are many bodies which have been left there because it is too dangerous to clear them. Whenever clearing is possible, people have been doing so. What stops us is funds. No one will want to go clear a body for free.
We have worked hard to clear bodies too. In 2018, I had to approach the Austrian consul to ask them for help to take down an Austrian climber’s body from Lobuche East.
Has the government helped you any way? Anything they can do?
I do not think they have. The laws are archaic and need changing. I firmly believe that tourism and mountaineering in the country have thrived only because of the private sector. The industry has gone cold.
What I think the government can do is bring out clear rules and regulations so that incidents like on Ama Dablam last year does not repeat. We need to be proactive and make rules considering the future. The rules were written in 2002 and need an update because a lot has changed. We have been asking the government to change it, but there has not been much support from them on this. We need to enforce quality tourism.
What happens to the funds generated from distributing climbing permits?
Currently, most of it goes to the national treasury. Some percentage does go to rural municipalities where the mountains are via the district. As of now, 55 per cent of the fund goes to the government. The rest is given to the rural municipalities and the provincial governments, but it is not clear how these funds are used.
I have been asking the government to set aside 10 per cent and set up a welfare fund for mountaineers because when they get old, they cannot climb mountains and that means no source of income. Doing that can set nice precedence and encourage these climbers to work hard.
Do you think Nepal should start promoting alpine-style climbing (climbing without ropes)? Many climbers from the West want a new challenge. Can we use some mountains for that?
It can be done. We know that Nepal has the mountains for these alpinists. But, what we need to think about before doing so is the jobs that we might lose due to this. That is not it, the risk of getting lost on the mountains and dying is also there. We want our mountains to be safe for people. I understand that a lot of adventurers want to climb new mountains and new route like they did back in the 70s, but for now, we feel that Nepal is not ready for alpine-style climbing.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mountain-day-covid-19-vaccines-in-nepal-a-must-to-ensure-mountaineering-revival.html,travel
Nepal’s Central Zoo reopens after 9 months of Covid-19 closure,"Thursday, December 10, 2020","Kathmandu, December 10
Nepal’s Central Zoo in Jawalakhel of Lalitpur is reopening to its visitors from Thursday after the closure of nine months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although the risk of virus infection is still prevalent in the country, the zoo is reopening as the closure affected the management of food for the captives and pay for the staff, according to its chief Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel.
Earlier, the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre had decided to reopen places such as the zoo while still maintaining necessary preventive measures against the infection.
Pokharel informs one person should leave the zoo within one and a half hours of their entry whereas there should not be more than 800 people inside at a time.
Now onwards, the visitors should wear masks inside the zoo premises whereas they need to get sanitised at the entrance.
They will be barred from giving food to and touching the animals. Likewise, eating anything inside the food will be prohibited.
It will open from 10 am to 5 pm everyday.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-central-zoo-reopens-after-9-months-of-covid-19-closure.html,travel
"8,848.86 m is the new height of Mount Everest, announce Nepal and China","Tuesday, December 8, 2020","Kathmandu, December 8
Nepal and China have jointly announced that Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, is 8,848.86 metres.
Until today, the official height of Sagarmatha as it is called in Nepal was 8,848 metres.
Nepal’s Foreign Affairs Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Land Management Minister Padma Kumari Aryal, Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi and other officials made the announcement during a virtual ceremony on Tuesday afternoon.
Nepal had launched a measurement mission in April 2019. The Nepali side already completed its task almost a year ago but was waiting for the Chinese side to finalise a date for the announcement.
Although Nepal had planned the remeasurement of the Everest height, believed to be altered by the 2015 earthquake, on its own, the two countries made an agreement in October last year to announce the height jointly. Following that, China measured the height of Everest from the northern side in May this year.

"Aiming to create history, 3 Nepali teams launch K2 climbing bid this winter","Monday, December 7, 2020","Climbing K2, the second-highest peak in the world, in the winter was never in Mingma Gyalje Sherpa‘s mind. He was content with what he was able to achieve in his 14-year mountaineering career. But, when a client asked him why no Nepali had their name on any of the winter ascents on 8,000-metre peaks, he was left speechless.
“I felt sad when they said that. It was a matter of shame that no Nepali had their names on mountains in their own country,” says Mingma Gyalje, also known as Mingma G.
In a bid to change that, Mingma G, in late 2019, teamed up with Icelander John Snorri Sigurjonsson, Slovenian Tomaz Rotar and Chinese Gao Li to climb K2, the only 8,000-metre mountain, among 14, yet to be climbed in the winter. However, due to bad weather, their summit bid was unsuccessful and he had to return disappointed.
“It was a good learning experience. It’s a reminder that sometimes things don’t go as planned,” says Mingma G.
However, he is not giving up on his dream of summiting the ‘Savage Mountain’ and is going back to Pakistan. But, this year, he wants to do things differently. Not wanting to be held back by anyone, he will try to summit without clients, but with members from this expedition company, Dawa Tenzing Sherpa and Kilu Pemba Sherpa.
He is not going to be alone either. In order to put the name of Nepal in mountaineering’s hall of fame, two other Nepali teams have announced that they will be going to Pakistan. A commercial expedition led by Chhang Dawa Sherpa from Seven Summit Treks will join them along with a team led by record-breaker Nimral Purja Magar (Nimsdai).
“It’s good that there are other teams joining us. But, more teams going does not guarantee a summit. (We) need a lot of things to work in our favour,” says Mingma G.
Many like Mingma G have fallen short of climbing K2 in the winter. Numerous teams have tried it since the late 1980s but none of them has been successful. Poor weather, harsh temperatures that can reach up to -50 degree centigrade, steep slopes and a technical climb have all played a role in all of those unsuccessful attempts. But, all three Nepali teams believe that they can take on, what many call is, the last great mountaineering challenge.
Seven Summit’s expedition came to life when Chhang Dawa Sherpa, like Mingma G, wanted a Nepali to reach the summit of K2 in the winter. Having seen the Poles and Russian try and fail, he wanted to see if a Nepali could do it. His plan was to send five experienced Nepali climbers to K2, but as the word got out, many foreigners from European countries wanted to join their expedition.
“Our initial aim was a small expedition to create history. But, we started to get a lot of queries from people who wanted to climb with us,” says Chhang Dawa, director and expedition leader at Seven Summit Trek, Nepal’s top mountaineering expedition agency.
Slowly one became two and before they knew it, they had over 20 foreign climbers who wanted to join their expedition.
“Making it a commercial one was never in our mind. But, when we started to get queries, we changed our plan. It gives us a chance to take more Nepali climbers to help those who will be making the summit push,” says Chhang Dawa, adding they had to stop taking bookings as more people wanted to join.
Mingma David Sherpa, who will be climbing with Nimsdai, says their team is going for similar reasons others are – to create history. He believes that this is the first time that such strong teams are assembling at K2 in the winter.
“It’s going to be great to have these climbers climb with us,” says Mingma David. “It’s going to be tough, everyone knows that. But, collectively, if we work on the same page, this dream of climbing K2 in the winter can be successful.”
All three teams know that their summit bid depends on the weather. All previous attempts, including that of Mingma G last year, came to an end because of it.
“Having climbed Lhotse in the winter, I had thought that the weather would be similar, but I was wrong,” says Mingma G. “It was extremely cold. We didn’t have the equipment. Our personal equipment was good enough, but the team equipment like tents and ropes let us down last year. This year, we’ve prepared ourselves better.”
Chhang Dawa is aware of how bad the weather might get. While he says that chances of rockfall and avalanches are quite low during the winter, the arctic-like temperate and high winds could derail their bid.
“It’s a place which only gets three to four hours of sunlight during the day. That means temperatures can go down to – 10-degree centigrade, even at the base camp,” says Chhang Dawa.
However, all teams say that the experience onboard also raises the chances of a summit bid.
“Look at the names going on this expedition. I’m sure most foreigners have looked at the names and joined the expedition,” says Mingma David. He says his climb with Nimsdai last year will also help him and his team take on K2.
That said, Mingma David believes that a successful summit can only happen if everyone is on the same page.
“Everyone has one goal,” he says. “We need to be on the same page and not be involved in politics.”
But, Chhang Dawa says he does not care which one of the teams will summit. But, he wants a Nepali to reach the top before anyone else. Unlike previous attempts in which Nepalis helped foreigners reach the top of mountains in Nepal and not get recognised for it, he wants a Nepali to get all the recognition, which is why he is taking three Nepali climbers only to climb and not guide.
“I want us to know that Nepalis are more than just guides. If we can successfully summit, we can show the world that Nepalis are not far from the alpinist from Europe. I want the world to know that we are climbers too,” says Chhang Dawa.
British mountaineer Kenton Cool believes that Nepalis trying to create history is a real positive for the sport.
“The chances of success are low, but there is a chance, especially with the Sherpa power,” says Cool. “It’s the last great challenge and they will have to be very very lucky if they want to pull this off.”
Apart from the three Nepali teams, there will be one more team that will try to summit K2. According to Allan Arnett’s blog, Pakistani climber Muhammad Ali Sadpara and his son Sajid Ali will guide Icelander Sigurjonsson who attempted it last year with Mingma G.
Mingma G’s team has already left for K2, while others are planning to leave by the end of December.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/aiming-to-create-history-3-nepali-teams-launch-k2-climbing-bid-this-winter.html,travel
Pattale could be the best destination to see Everest with the naked eye,"Saturday, December 5, 2020","The blue sky, clean and fresh wind, peaceful environment, and the mesmerising view of the mountain range. And, the best part is the view of Sagarmatha (Everest), the tallest mountain in the world, from your bedroom.
The best place to experience all this would be Pattale of Solukhumbu.
There will not be a person in the world who would not want to live such an experience. If only you could just take some time out and indulge in what would give you peace.
Post the Covid-19 pandemic, travelling has not been easy. However, people are travelling. And, for those who want to travel long roads, see the mountains and eat organic, Pattale is the best destination.
Pattale is situated at the height of 3,000 metres above sea level. It is the best viewpoint from where you can observe dozens of mountain ranges including the one with the highest and the third highest mountains in the world.
This is also the place where you can view the majestic mountains first thing in the morning, from your very room.
Maybe this was the place that inspired lyricist Kali Prasad Rijal to write the famous song “Bihana uthne bittikai himal dekhna paaiyos..” (I wish to get to see the mountains in the morning after waking up…).
**
My plan to go to Pattale with journalist Rajendra Baniya had been failing repeatedly. But, last week, we took the opportunity and made our way to Pattale with other media persons Pramod Neupane, Gopal Pathak, and Puru Dahal. I joined the team from Bhaktapur.
The route was not new to me. I had reached Pattale for the first time four years ago. This was my third time.
Reaching Pattale is not hard though. The first 10 hours of travel on the bus, starting from Koteshwar, was rather easy. We had started our journey late, so it was 9 pm when we reached the destination.
We had expected the place to be more remote. However, the place was already crowded with domestic tourists. But, thankfully, we had already booked our rooms before leaving Kathmandu and hence did not need to worry about the room.
Baniya was grateful that he could experience the tallest mountain in the world from a place so close to Kathmandu.
**
The mayor of Solu Dudhkunda municipality, Namgel Jabung Sherpa, says Pattale still lacks sufficient promotion.
“Solukhumbu is known as the district of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest). It attracts scores of national and international tourists. And, everyone should reach or see Sagarmatha once in their lives. But, one does not need to reach the base camp or the summit to get that experience, one can reach to places like Pattale or Pike Danda. But, due to the lack of promotions, people have not reached the place.
The trip to Pattale or Pike Danda was very much popular till before the insurgency period. The dropped number of tourists is slowly gaining pace again.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/patale-destination-everest.html,travel
"Kenton Cool, world-famous mountaineer, says he got to witness Nepal differently this season","Friday, December 4, 2020","Kenton Cool is one of the world’s leading high-altitude climbers. He is the only European to summit Everest 14 times. Apart from that, Cool, in 2013, became the first person in history to complete the ‘Everest Triple Crown’, climbing the peaks of Everest, Nuptse and Lhotse in one continuous push from base camp. In 2007, he even pushed himself to the summit of Everest twice in one week.
His track record as a mountain guide is immaculate. He has completed over 44 expeditions as he holds the highest success rate of any mountain guide on Everest. His track record is so good that names like Ben Fogle (broadcaster), Sir Ranulph Fiennes (adventurer), and Richard Branson (business tycoon) climb with him.
Cool was recently in Nepal to climb Mera Peak and Ama Dablam with his clients. Onlinekhabar caught up with Cool to talk to him about his recent expedition, his love for Nepal, and how Nepal’s mountaineering industry can make a comeback in these unprecedented times shattered by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Excerpts:
Are you upset that you didn’t get to summit this time?
I am upset that I haven’t climbed anything this season. Of course, it would have been great to summit Mera Peak or Ama Dablam. But for me, the summit is a very small part of a much bigger adventure. If we get focused on the summit, we are often disappointed. But, my client is really happy. We gave it a real go in pretty bad weather. But, we had such a beautiful time in Khumbu. I got to see the country beyond being tourists, and that, for me, is very empowering and enriching. We didn’t get to the top, but it’s been an amazing adventure. I really feel blessed.
Why and when did you decide to come to Nepal to climb amid this pandemic?
The plan was to climb Everest in the spring with my clients. However, that didn’t happen due to Covid-19. It was probably in July when my client said ‘why don’t we climb Ama Dablam’. At the time, we felt that Nepal would be open by the time autumn arrived. But, as time passed, we realised that it wasn’t going to open anytime soon. That caused some readjustment of our plans.
Then, I got a call from the people whom I work with in Nepal who told me that Nepal was going to open on October 17, which fitted my plan perfectly. I was due to come here around October 20 with an Indian client to climb Mera Peak. That didn’t work out quite well. So, I came back to Kathmandu to pick up another client and head to Khumbu to climb.
Was it odd taking the route to Ama Dablam instead of Everest?
It wasn’t. I’ve been to Ama Dablam before and it’s a beautiful mountain. It’s not Everest, but it’s still a serious mountain.
What I liked about going up there was realising how peaceful it was. I know Khumbu intimately, but I’d never seen the Khumbu that I got to experience this year. What made this trip better was that I didn’t have the pressure of climbing Everest. That and the fact that there were so few people made the trip remarkable.
So do you feel this trip was more intimate?
It was. I was in Nepal for six weeks, and everywhere I went, people were so pleased to see me. From Lukla, I went to the Hinku valley to head to Mera Peak. In the villages, people were so grateful that we came. They were telling me how I was the first tourist they saw in nearly a year.
One of my concerns was how people would react to a foreigner coming to their village. But, everyone was so welcoming. People were thanking me for coming to their villages. It was very humbling.
You also realise how these people were not taken care of by the government. I realised deciding which teahouse to stay in was going to have a big impact on people. Most times, we were the only people there.  I feel blessed to have come to Nepal now and experience Nepal the way I have done. It’s sad for the country, but for me personally and selfishly, it was beautiful. I know I will never experience Nepal like this before.
How do you rate Ama Dablam among other mountains you have climbed in Nepal?
In terms of guiding, it is the most technical mountain. But, thanks to the fixed lines, it is much more accessible and simpler. Without them, it would be one of the hardest mountains to guide.
With mountaineering agencies already marketing the upcoming spring season, how do you think mountaineering will make a comeback here in Nepal?
From my experience here in Nepal, I’ve realised how important tourists are in this country. I get messages myself from people telling me how they want to visit Nepal, and how many are planning to come in 2021. You get a sense that people are ready to travel again. I hope that the small number of tourists who have come now will pave the way for more people, but more people in a responsible way.
In Namche, I interviewed some lodge owners, doctors and coffee shop owners, and they were all talking about education on how they can respond to more tourists. It was nice to see that they were talking about how a lodge can accommodate ‘Covid restriction’ yet still be open for more tourists. And, I believe if this education is put in place properly, and with the right planning, people will surely come, and Nepal will be bustling with tourists again. I am personally hopeful that there will be an Everest season come May 2021.
Do you already have clients for Everest 2021?
Yes, I do. The client with whom I was here to climb Ama Dablam will be with me if there is an Everest season. I hope and pray that things get better globally, and I can come here in April again and I can see my friends here in Nepal and work with them and help Nepal get back on its feet.
Do you have any plans of climbing Everest in the fall in the future?
It is in the back of my mind. Some of us were hoping to come in September and see if it could be done, but due to Covid, we could not.
What makes Everest accessible in the spring is the number of teams present and of course ‘Sherpa power’. During the fall, there are hardly any teams and that means it is a lot tougher than it is in the spring.  You don’t have the teamwork and collaboration summit. But, yea, climbing Everest during that time would be nice. I want to witness Everest without so many people.
Who is the most famous person you’ve climbed with? Is it hard to guide famous people?
I’ve been lucky to have climbed with a lot of prominent names. I climbed with Richard Branson, Sam Branson, Ben Fogle, and Sir Ranulph Finnes. It’s not that hard. I feel it’s the same ’cause when you are near the mountain, you need to pack your ego and leave it aside ’cause the mountain does not like egos.
Do they go back humbled by the mountains?
Well, in a way, they do ’cause most of them would have never thought that they would be experiencing those things that they experience. They’re all very grounded, I feel. They’re people like you and me. Ben and Sam are very grounded. Sam’s head was in the clouds a little bit, but over the years, he’s become very mature and grounded.
Do you look at criteria when you choose clients?
I look for people whom I can get along with ’cause I don’t want any tension when climbing mountains like Everest.  They come to me, we go to the Alps to see how we get on. If we don’t get on, it’s too big a risk. If we do, we come and climb. I always say to my client that my goal is to bring them back through the front door regardless of whether we summit or not.
The first priority is always safety. The second is having fun ’cause you got to enjoy it. Lastly, my job is to get them to the summit. But, it’s quite a distant three.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kenton-cool-everest-mountaineer.html,travel
Tourism minister hopeful of rise in tourists’ footfall in Nepal next year,"Monday, November 30, 2020","Chitwan, November 30
Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Yogesh Bhattarai, predicts that the number of foreign tourists arriving in Nepal would grow significantly in 2021.

The government had prioritised the promotion of local tourism, according to the minister, as he viewed the travel culture was becoming popular among the middle and upper-class families in Nepal also.
He also assured that the health protocols were being strictly implemented in the tourism destinations and hotels among others to ensure Covid-19 control.
On the occasion, Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security, Rameshwar Ray Yadav, lamented that the labour market was ravaged by Covid-19 and spoke for the need to create jobs in the country for the youth who lost their jobs abroad due to the pandemic.

Chitwan entrepreneurs launching Visit Sauraha campaign to revive tourism,"Sunday, November 29, 2020","Chitwan, November 29
Tourism entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in Chitwan have decided to launch the Visit Sauraha campaign in order to revive the tourism industry hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
District Coordination Committee, Ratnanagar Municipality, Regional Hotel Association Sauracha chapter are jointly launching the campaign, giving a message that ‘Sauraha is safe’. The tourism entrepreneurs are all set to work in coordination for the campaign.
They will also reach all seven provinces and make people aware that Sauraha is safe.
The chairman of Regional Hotel Association’s Sauraha chapter, Dipak Bhattarai, says although they had planned to launch the campaign before the Dashain festival, it was delayed because of Covid-19. He informs that people from various cities across the country would be invited to visit Sauraha.
One of the major tourist hubs in the country, Sauraha has seen scant arrival of tourists in recent days. “We had expected that Sauraha would see tourists’ arrival during Dashain and Tihar, but in vain. We’re prepared to ensure safety to tourists by adhering to the health protocols. However, there are very few tourists here,” Bhattarai shares the plight.
The severe decline in tourism activities has resulted in joblessness and closure of businesses, according to him. In normal times, it is the peak season for tourism in Sauraha.

Camping at Panch Pokhari: A chilled trek turned into pilgrimage,"Friday, November 27, 2020","When my friend Dibesh and I came up with the idea to trek to Panch Pokhari in Sindhupalchok, both of us were stoked. As we were planning the trip, his friends, Subodh and Sabrina, also decided to tag along.
As we were in the middle of a pandemic, in a bid to avoid people, we decided to make it a camping trek. What made the trek even better was we were going during the time of the Leonid meteor shower, which fell just after Laxmi Puja (Nov 14).
The planning part was easy. We just needed essentials like food, a portable gas cylinder, a tent and a sleeping bag. But mentally, we were not ready. None of us had ever slept in tents. But, we had to this time. Not only that, but we also had to cook our own food. Keeping that in mind, the four of us boarded a jeep and headed towards Bhotang, a village just 75 km from Kathmandu.
However, little did we know that in a few days, we would be walking towards Panch Pokhari, thirsty, hungry, and sleepless. We had not expected to sleep in cowsheds. What started as a chilled camping trip at first turned into a hardcore pilgrimage to a land where locals believe Lord Shiva planted wheat.
Day 1
The first day was spent on a jeep, travelling through typical Nepali roads. It was dusty and bumpy, full of narrow bends. The road until Melamchi was bearable, but from then on, all of us wished that we had rather walked. What made the ride worse was the driver’s constant nagging about how bad the road was. Hungry and tired, we reached Bhotang after around seven hours, then walked up to Deurali, set up the camps for the night before sunset and cooked dinner and got ready for bed. Just before we called it a night, the sky treated us with a few shooting stars. We went to bed hoping for more the next day.
Day 2
We realised that sleeping in a tent was not going to be easy and would take some getting-used-to. With hardly any sleep, we had our breakfast and left Deurali. Our goal was to reach Nasimpati, nine hours away from Deurali, that day.
As we started our ascent, locals warned us about the trail ahead. They told us we would struggle to reach Nasimpati and even if we did, we had to stay in sheds as the lodge owners were all coming down for Diwali (they meant Bhaitika). However, as we had all essentials, we did not worry too much and headed towards it anyway.
The trail from Deurali to Tuppi Danda was simple, but we made it a difficult one as we took a wrong trail hoping it was shorter. The trail took us to a hilltop, the one which we were not supposed to be at. Everyone was confused for a while, but we found the right trail and we were on our way. It took us three hours to reach Tuppi Danda, an hour more than expected. That is when Sabrina told us she couldn’t walk anymore. So, we decided to camp there and watched the sun set over the hills.
Day 3
We wanted to reach Panch Pokhari on the third day. But it was going to be very tough. Locals told us it would take eight to 12 hours to reach the place. With grey clouds above us, Dibesh and I knew that reaching Panch Pokhari was just wishful thinking for the day.
The first 45 minutes of the trail from Tuppi Danda were easy. The trail was mostly flat with a few odd uphills and downhills through a forest. As soon as the trail reached a river, the only way was up until you would reach Tap Kharka. Filling water whenever we got the chance, we made it to Tap Kharka when the weather turned worse.
The grey clouds turned darker, and before we knew it, it started snowing. With a damp tent from the night before, we knew this was going to be a tough day for all of us. What saved us from the snow was a resting shed a bit further from Tap Kharka. The shed was an absolute mess. The surface was uneven, and it was tiny. But, with the uncertain weather, we had no choice but to stay there.
We set up our mats, but we were left in awe. While it kept snowing towards the north, the clouds opened up like a curtain to treat us to a stunning sunset. Even though it was bitter cold, the view provided us with enough warmth for the night. Watching shooting stars, wishing we would reach Panch Pokhari the next morning, we slept.
Day 4
Sleeping at the shed was probably the toughest thing anyone of us had ever done. It was windy and cold the entire night. Even though we had tried to cover up the holes in the walls, it made little to no difference. By 4 am, all of us were awake and by 6, rationing and drinking what little water we had, we were on our way to Panch Pokhari.
The first part of the trail was easy. Even though all of us were hungry, we reached the place in an hour. But, soon, whatever we had eaten was all gone. Apart from Dibesh, all of us looked glum. He even tried to look for water, but the one he found was as long as the route to Panch Pokhari. Not wanting to waste time, we drank what little water we had and left.
The trail to Panch Pokhari was very complicated. The first 30 minutes were easy. But, after a while, it started to get tedious as the trail went along the foot of the high hills for hours. Winding uphill and downhill, passing through rocky terrain and what looked like landslide areas, we reached a staircase of 165 steps. Thirsty, hungry, and with no energy left, Dibesh and I pushed ourselves to the top of the stairs hoping we had reached Panch Pokhari, but what we saw from the top shattered us.
We had not reached Panch Pokhari but had reached the final checkpoint called Lauri Binayak. With our throats dry, we sat and started collecting snow so that we could melt and drink it. There, we met a few trekkers on their way back. A few gulps of water the three boys gave us went a long way. Drinking that and a can of Red Bull, our final push towards the destination began. Just as we started, it started snowing again.
Trying to squeeze every ounce of energy, lifting one leg at a time we finally reached Panch Pokhari. As soon as we reached, Dibesh and I threw our bags in the hall, headed to the kitchen and drank a thermos of water sitting next to the fire waiting for Sabrina and Subodh. As they arrived, we ate dal-bhat after what felt like years and went on a stroll around the area before deciding to sleep indoors.
Day 5
The next morning, everyone woke up late. It looked bright and sunny from the room, but as we went outside, the wind gave us a harsh reality check. From the sleeping bag, we went straight into the kitchen and sat next to the fire drinking local warm liquor.
There, we decided to teach the lodge owner Prakash Tamang how to make pancakes. A few hours later, he was flipping pancakes like a pro. Around noon, we headed to the viewpoint as we thought we were getting very lazy.
The trail to the viewpoint is long and winding. But being the adventurers that we were, we climbed the steep hill which went through some rocky parts disregarding the trail in general. It was not easy, but it was refreshing. The mountains to the east of the viewpoint were covered in clouds, but all five ponds of Panch Pokhari, which were around 20 minutes away, were visible.
It was windy, gloomy and cold. But, the climb to the top was worth it. That view took all our tiredness away. It gave us the added motivation to come back to the viewpoint the next morning. That is when Dibesh decided to spend the night in the tent at an altitude of around 4,100 metres. I wanted to join in, but I could not muster up the courage to do so. We headed down, came back up with the tent and the sleeping bags, and set up the camp for Dibesh and headed for dinner.
The view of the sky from Panch Pokhari was just amazing. The moon had made an entrance but soon set beyond the hills. But, we could see the galaxy of stars–millions of them. Some turned into shooting stars, and as romantic we were, all of us made wishes.
Day 6
The next morning was the most magical morning I had ever seen. Sabrina decided to stay in so Subodh and I, carrying a thermos of hot water, started the steep climb to the top. As we neared the top of the hill, we saw the daybreak in its most splendid form.
The sun slowly rising behind the mountains gave out a mellow yellow glow on the top. Above the yellow glow were stars–not just one, but millions of stars. Subodh and I were in awe. We had not expected the view. Just before sunrise, we caught up with Dibesh who was up there at least 30 minutes before us.
As we sat there at the hilltop drinking hot water like old men, we saw the sunrise over Jugal Himal. The sun brought a little more warmth and slowly illuminated a few of the five ponds. That sunrise marked the end of our journey. We had to leave, but we did not want to.
Going back was a bittersweet moment. The journey was ending. However, before that, we had to walk six hours – mostly downhill. Until Nasimpati, we were alone. There, we started to meet people.
After five days in the wilderness, we finally saw people. Like us, they too were struggling coming up. Encouraging them, and offering them water, we walked and walked and walked. It felt like Tuppi Danda would never come. But, walking through the forest that was bustling with fall colours, we reached Tuppi Danda.
Then, we realised how dirty the trails had gotten. People who came up had left loads of trash on the trail, from chocolate, biscuit and instant noodle wrappers to plastic cups and bottles. We were back into civilisation. And, our journey was over.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/camping-at-panch-pokhari.html,travel
Lumbini is open to visitors after 8 months,"Thursday, November 19, 2020","Butwal, November 19
Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, in southwestern Nepal, is open to visitors now, after a gap of eight months.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus infection in the country, the holy site was barred from tourists in March this year. However, with the federal government recently deciding to reopen all tourism activities, interested people can visit Maya Devi Temple, Ashoka Pillar and other monuments in the Lumbini premises, according to Lumbini Development Trust.
However, entering the Maya Devi Temple is barred for now, but it will also be open after a few days, the trust informs.
The trust’s Chief Administrative Officer Gyanin Rai says all visitors should wear a mask and their body temperatures will be measured at entrance to ensure safety.
Meanwhile, local tourism entrepreneurs have expressed their happiness over the reopening. “Many domestic tourists have been seen on the first day of reopening here,” Lila Mani Sharma Paudel, the general secretary of Lumbini Hotel Association says, “The entrepreneurs were worried about the closure of the monuments in the peak seasons. Now, we have expected more footfalls of domestic tourists.”
Months between September and December see more visitors in Lumbini than in other months.

Nepal’s Central Zoo to reopen amid Covid-19 pandemic,"Wednesday, November 18, 2020","Kathmandu, November 18
Nepal’s Central Zoo will soon reopen after the closure of around eight months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although the risk of virus infection is still increasing in the country, the zoo management is preparing to reopen as the closure affected the management of food for the captives and pay for the staff, according to its chief Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel.
“The rate of virus infection has not come down but the fear in people certainly has,” Pokharel says, “Now, we will soon reopen. We have also prepared a protocol to follow for the visitors.”
According to him, now onwards, the visitors should wear masks inside the zoo premises whereas they will be barred from giving food to and touching the animals. Likewise, eating anything inside the food will be prohibited.
One person should leave the zoo within one and a half hours of their entry whereas there should not be more than 800 people inside at a time.

Climbing Ama Dablam amid Covid-19 was a dream come true for Qatari royal,"Monday, November 16, 2020","Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family travelled to Nepal for the first time in 2008. Known as Moe Al Thani in the climbing world, the prince had earned recognition as the first Qatari to climb Mount Everest in 2013. Still, he had not been able to climb Ama Dablam near Everest.
“But, I wanted to climb it since 2009,” Al Thani said on Saturday after successfully making his dream come true last week, “If you ask me [why it is so], it will be a very long answer.”
“I saw it during my second visit to Nepal when I reached the Everest Base Camp. I always wanted to climb it since but never got any opportunity.”
In October this year, however, the royal got an email from his old friend in the United States, Garrett Madison, also a climber. The American friend informed him that he was preparing to climb Ama Dablam this autumn. Although Al Thani was not prepared for any expedition anytime soon due to the Covid-19 crisis across the world, he decided to sign up for the Ama Dablam expedition because it would make him achieve a long-awaited opportunity.
It was just two weeks before they arrived in Kathmandu. In the two weeks, they prepared everything ready including travel documents and logistics for the Nepal trip.
“But, once we reached the mountains, we forgot everything about Covid-19… Everything there was as it was in the past,” he remembered. Perhaps that spirit helped him climb the 6,812-metre peak.
Else, the sheikh said this mountain was “much harder than Everest.”
Nevertheless, for the prince, climbing a mountain always meant challenges in life. But still, it is an achievement worth pursuing because reaching the top metaphorically means overcoming all those challenges once faces in life.
Al Thani feels it was a great honour to him that his expedition became the first team to climb Ama Dablam this year as all mountaineering activities were closed in the spring.
As soon as the government reopened its door to climbers and trekkers, Al Thani and Madison had no qualms about climbing the peak. But why?
The Qatari royal says, “Since 2008, I have been visiting Nepal almost every year. I have been to jungles, rivers, and hills in this country. I love this country. But, the best thing about Nepal is mountains.”
Moreover, he says Ama Dablam is the most beautiful mountain in the world. So why would he delay challenging himself on this peak?
Completing the expedition, he returned home on Sunday. On Saturday, Nepal’s Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Yogesh Bhattarai saw him off, also congratulating on the achievement.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/climbing-ama-dablam-amid-covid-19-was-a-dream-come-true-for-qatari-royal.html,travel
"Manahunkot was a forlorn hill. Today, it’s viral on TikTok. How will it develop next?","Saturday, November 14, 2020","Last Saturday, the Manahunkot hill in Vyas municipality-5 of Tanahun district saw nearly 10,000 visitors. Around three-km road leading up to the hilltop was congested with four-wheelers and two-wheelers.
Local Rewati Gurung, 65, was amazed to see the sudden crowd of the domestic tourists there where people could be hardly seen until a few weeks ago.
“I have never seen these many people in my life. Good Lord! These many people had never come here,” Gurung said, laughing, “Some were taking  photographs, some others were dancing, some were shouting,  and we were all busy selling goods.”
Manahunkot was abuzz with the crowds of people gathered there. However, like many other locals, Gurung was also unaware of what triggered the sudden flow of thousands of visitors there.
Of course, how would they even get time to think about this? Most of them were all busy selling goods to visitors. Earlier, only a few used to come there. It has just been a few months since this site has been seeing crowds of visitors.
Vyas municipality’s ward 5 chairman Mohan Kumar Shrestha said, “It was so crowded in Manungkot on Saturday that we were scared. Thousands of people came in one day. And, by Friday evening only, more than 700 visitors had already arrived here and set up tents.”
After being stuck home for months during the lockdown and other restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak, many people went out of their homes as soon as the restrictions were over– searching for some places to enjoy and refresh themselves. Some people enjoying nature also reached Manahunkot and made a Tiktok video with beautiful fogs in the background.
With the arrival of the Dashain, this trend skyrocketed. The view of sunrise and sunset from the hilltop, ever-changing shapes of fogs, and the view of mountains and hills half-covered with fogs and clouds during the winter are the main attractions of Manahunkot.
These features of Manahunkot as shown in Tiktok videos won the hearts of many others. The place went viral on the site. Some videos crossed thousands of views and likes in a single day. This excited the younger generation about visiting Manahunkot. They went there, made, and uploaded similar Tiktok videos.
The number of people reaching Manahunkot only to make TikTok videos suddenly soared. Hundreds of videos of Manahunkot have been uploaded on Tiktak on Saturday alone with hashtags like #ManungkotDamauli, #ManungkotDamauliNepal, #Manahunkot, and #ManahunkotTanahunNepal. And, millions have liked them.
One of the visitors, Utsab, from Pokhara, shared, “The sight of the sun rising in a sea of ​​fog is truly amazing. We feel like jumping into those layers of fog. After reaching Manahunkot, the heart really celebrates the festival.”
Ward chair Shrestha also viewed that the sudden increase in the number of visitors in Manahunkot was linked to Tiktok.
However, many took to social media and criticised the crowds stating they increased the risk of the spread of the virus. And now, considering the ongoing pandemic and the sudden hordes of people, the Vyas municipality has only allowed 300 visitors per day to visit the site.
Considered to be the abode of sages Parasar and Vyas, this place is also associated with fogs in mythology also. Next to the confluence of Seti and Madi was an ashram of the sage Parasar. After being attracted by the beauty of Matsyagandha, he had had intercourse with her, by creating fogs and by transforming the child Matsyagandha into an adult, and changing the smell of fish into fragrance while swimming in the river.
There is a myth that Vyas was born out of that relationship. That is why this place is also known as the abode of the same Parasar sage, and the birthplace of Veda Vyas.
Just like in this mythological tale, this place is lost under the veil of fogs every winter.
Rewati Aale vividly remembers migrating to a crowded village after her wedding in 1975.
“When I came here after my wedding, there were many houses in this village. At that time, once I forget my own house and went to someone else’s. Such a lively village later turned deserted,” reminisced Aale.
According to Aale, there were around 60 houses in Manahunkot at that time. The village had 43 households till 1996, informed Jhul Bahadur Thapa, a local of Manahunkot who started teaching there in the same year.
As per Thapa, also the headmaster of Manung Primary School, Manahunkot is a pure Magar settlement. He further described, “It is called Manung because it has a stone that looks similar to a ‘mana’ (a container used in measurement traditionally). We call it Manung; some even call it Manahun. Earlier, only Magars used to live here, and there were other castes in the villages below the hilltop.”
Despite the infrastructural development following the political change in and around the area nearby Manungkot, the residents of Manungkot were still facing the scarcity of water.  “It used to take five hours to fetch water. Looking downwards (at Damauli), it was seen illuminated with lights. And, above, it was dark, ” said Aale, “Other than this, everything was fine. However, people were leaving the village due to the water shortage.”
The villagers had hoped that water and development would reach the village with political change. Jhul Bahadur Thapa said a school was built in the village with an initiative of the then Education Minister Govinda Raj Joshi in the early 1990s, and a tank was built in the village to collect even the rainwater from the roof of the same school. “However, that much water couldn’t be sufficient for the whole village.”
“Around mid-2000s, many people started migrating to a place called Sora,” he said, “The village itself was displaced due to water scarcity.”
Despite the assurances of every political leader during the elections, the dream of water in Manahunkot never came true, complained Thapa.
As of now, there are only seven houses in the Manahunkot. Three families have recently returned there after the increasing flow of visitors.
The unpaved road to Manahunkot was built around 2005. Soon, during the Tanahun Festival, locals tested paragliding there. Shortly afterwards, a national-level Manahun Tourism Literary Festival was held. Tanahun continued to be known as a tourist destination, and such events continued to take place in Manahunkot. However, it could not leap up to fame and development even after having such natural aesthetics.
Nevertheless, Manahunkot has finally come to fame and become the choice of Nepali visitors due to social media. Although all the seven houses in the village are makeshift hotels now, this site has neither a good toilet nor a proper accommodation facility. It is no secret that those seven houses cannnot accommodate thousands of visitors coming there.
About half of the road to the hilltop is blacktopped and further plans are on to blacktop the rest.
“We buy bottled water and water supplied by tankers to cope up with the water crisis now. With the construction of roads, it has been easier to bring water on tankers,” said Keshari Thapa, a local. Hundreds of visitors visit daily, but there are not any well-facilitated hotels or resorts. Due to the lack of accommodation, visitors themselves bring food and tents to stay here.
After the influx of visitors, some locals who had migrated from the place selling all their properties are regretting. Meanwhile, new investors are being attracted to this place. Ward chairman Mohan Kumar Shrestha said that investors wre showing interest in building a resort and a big hotel in Manahunkot.
With the increase in the number of visitors, the price of land is also increasing in Manahunkot and adjacent places such as Deurali, Naughare, Charghare, Chhapathok, and Bachryang. Mayor Baikuntha Neupane said a meeting of the municipality held in Manahunkot on Sunday had stopped the sale of land for the next two months so that the place could be developed as a tourist site.
At present, a view tower is being built on the hilltop at a cost of Rs 4 million. Work is in progress for building the trekking route from Patan, Chapaghat, and other areas at a cost of Rs 4 million. And, by now, the work of installing railings has already been completed.
Mayor Neupane informed that the meeting of the municipal executive committee also decided to make a master plan for solving the water crisis, building proper and well-facilitated infrastructures like toilets and others.
The municipality has planned to change the face of Manahunkot, which is just six km away from Chapaghat on the Prithvi Highway, just like of Bandipur and Nagarkot.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/manahunkot-was-a-forlorn-hill-today-its-viral-on-tiktok-how-will-it-develop-next.html,travel

Hyatt Regency Kathmandu recognised as Nepal’s leading hotel,"Wednesday, November 11, 2020","Kathmandu, November 11
Hyatt Regency Kathmandu on Tuesday announced it has been recognised as Nepal’s leading hotel by World Travel Awards during its 27th annual event.

Shuklaphanta National Park can be nature lovers’ next destination in western Nepal,"Saturday, November 7, 2020","Shuklaphanta is a safe haven for wildlife. This open grassland is the home to a diverse range of flora and fauna ranging from tiger to wild boar and from swamp deer to peacock.
Be it for observing these species closely or for studying them, this grassland is like an open museum for all the keen visitors.
The scenic and wildlife beauty of Shuklaphanta can attract any nature lover towards it. And, I am no exception. Like many, I too have been enticed by the attractions there and to calm my thirst of exploring the biodiversity, I have been drawn to Shuklaphanta five times.
Despite being born and brought up in Doti, I got to visit Shuklaphanta much later, in 2011. It was named a wildlife reserve then.
Upon reaching Shuklaphanta then, I saw a swamp deer for the first time. And, I was just astounded by its beauty.
Afterwards, whenever the thought of Shuklaphanta hits my mind, the image of swamp deers’ dance comes around my eyes.
From then onwards, I have been there again and again.
Making some free time out of my busy schedule, I travel to western Nepal whenever it is possible. The idea of ‘wild west Nepal’ is developed not only for the purpose of travelling but also for promoting tourism in western Nepal. Despite the enormous potential for tourism, western Nepal has not been relatively successful in promoting itself.
As an example, let’s talk about Shuklaphanta for now. This wonderland is nothing less than the world of wildlife we often see on foreign television channels. It is claimed as one of the largest open grasslands in Asia. Here, one can witness and enjoy the large herds of distinct species of deer including the swamp deer.
Likewise, it is also the home to varied species of reptiles and birds. This park offers its visitors an opportunity to enjoy jeep and elephant safari every morning and evening.
Shuklaphanta, which was earlier established as a hunting reserve in 1969 for the ruling class and royals, is now changed into a national park.
Shuklaphanta Jungle Cottage run by Parmananda Bhandari, Shuklajungle Tented Camp operated by ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral and the community homestay of the Rama Tharu community are in operation in Shuklaphanta. Mahendranagar, five km away from the park, has about a dozen tourist-friendly hotels.
For the ones who are planning to make Shuklaphanta their next travel destination, here is the detail on how one can reach there.
You can fly from Kathmandu to Dhangadhi. From there, hire a jeep for a two-hour ride to reach the park. Else, you can also take a public bus from Kathmandu that will take about 24 hours to reach there.

Interesting experiences that await you in far-western Nepal,"Saturday, October 24, 2020","Multiethnic Nepal is widely popular among tourists for being the land of the Himalayas. It offers plenty of travel options for travellers. Importantly, one of the most attractive features of Nepal is its popular off-the-beaten-track trek destinations. Tourists are awestruck to witness the breathtaking natural beauty along with adventurous activities. The far-west region of the country is rich in both.
The far-western province of Nepal is named Sudurpaschim (that again means far-west), and it includes nine districts. It is spread over 19,539 square kilometres.
When one thinks of the province, they think of the one isolated, remote and undeveloped with the unavailability of basic services and complex socio-economic structures. But, many are not aware it also houses some of the popular destinations in Nepal. The far-western side of Nepal is yet to be explored, so if you are visiting Nepal and want to discover the country, we mention places to travel next for some unique experiences.
One of the must-explore destinations in far-western Nepal is Kailali. This district has an area of 3,235 square kilometres. You can go to this place from Kathmandu via air or bus (to Dhangadhi). The place holds splendid natural beauty, unique biodiversity and joyous cultural ethics.
You will love the blend of Tharu, Dotyali, and Nepali cultures there. Also, you will witness green forests all around with gleaming rivers. The district gives a beautiful range of touristic attractions like the famous Karnali Bridge which is known as the model bridge of Asia. It has a single pole for its support, and to be on the bridge is a great experience.
Do visit Ghodaghodi lake which is in the shape of a hand covering an area of 1.38 square kilometres. To be precise, there, you can glance 450 types of plants, 148 species of birds, 32 species of butterflies, 300 types of medicinal herbs, and 27 species of fish. Also, there are around 100 dolphins of Platanista Gangetica species in the Karnali river.
The next destination you can consider is Kanchanpur, gloriously known for swamp deer (barasinghas) in the Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve. It is also filled with beautiful historic destinations and glittery lakes. Moreover, you can also visit the multi-suspension bridge there which is famous for rafting, swimming and sightseeing.

10 things you can experience only in Nepal,"Saturday, October 10, 2020","Nepal is a landlocked country, famously called the yam between the two stones. The country is so small that it can be easily missed on the world map. Nonetheless, it is filled with diversity in every aspect. It consists of not only beautiful landscapes but also amazing traditions and languages with multiple ethnic and religious groups. There is so much to experience in this small country.
In fact, there are certain things you can experience only in Nepal. Here are some of such experiences:
It must be no surprise that Everest climbing is the most famous thing you can do in Nepal. Climbing the highest peak in the world, which stands at an astounding 8848 metres above the sea level, is not a simple task or an achievement to scoff at. Your endurance and patience must be extraordinary if you want to climb Mount Everest. But, at the summit, the top of the world, you will experience a majestic view, and you are sure to feel accomplished.
If you ever visit Nepal, tasting delicious Nepali food is a must. Nepali cuisines are a perfect combination of flavours, ingredients and cooking styles. Many of these cuisines are inspired by neighbouring countries like China, and India, but they have their own unique style based on geography and climate.
Local Nepali staple foods like dal bhat and dhindo are one of the most popular ones. These are best served with different curries like gundrukko jhol (fermented leafy green pickle soup) or meat curries like chicken or mutton. When it comes to cultural cuisine, Newari cuisines is the most famous one. These dishes are not only made with varieties of ingredients but are also supposed to be healthy and are cooked in less fat.
Jatra is a type of carnival/street festival which is celebrated prominently by the Newari community in the Kathmandu valley. Jatras carry huge importance to the Newari community. Major jatras include Yenya (Indra Jatra), Janbahadya Jatra, Bungdya Jatra, Biska Jatra, Bhoto Dekhaune Jatra, Handigaunko Jatra, etc.
Most of this jatras are celebrated inside the valley with the exception of Shikali Jatra which is celebrated in Banepa and Dolakha Jatra is celebrated in Dolakha. Each of these jatras has its own origins and importance to the Newari community. They are huge events that a whole city celebrates with fervour. They are an experience you should not miss in your Nepal visit.
Lumbini is one of the holiest and most famous Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Nepal and the world. Siddhartha Gautam, who later achieved enlightenment and became Gautam Buddha, was born and raised in this place. He also founded Buddhism, one of the major religions we know today. This place holds the record of his life, and you can find various other sites that hold extreme religious and historical importance. Some of those sites include Maya Devi temple, the Ashoka pillar, Myanmar golden temple, Dharma Swami Maharjan Buddha Bihar, and the World Peace Pagoda.
Bouddha stupa is one of the largest stupas in the world. It is also a popular tourist site in Nepal. It is believed this stupa contains holy relics like pieces of bone from the skeleton of Lord Buddha. Boudha is an important place for pilgrimage and mediation for Tibetans.
This stupa is also used by merchants for peace and resting place. It is a go-to place for the youth and tourists as well. One can find places, people, cuisines and cultures highly influenced by Tibetan culture here.
Another great experience in Nepal is to visit the ‘living goddess’. Kathmandu has a tradition in which young girls from Bajracharya and Shakya clans are considered as manifestations of divine energy. They are known as Kumari. In the Newari culture, Kumari is revered and believed to have the ability to cure sickness. There are many kumaris throughout the cities, but the best-known kumari is The Royal Kumari of Kathmandu. She lives in the Kumari Ghar which is situated in the centre of the city.
These are one of the most important herbs found in the Himalayan region of Nepal, for both economic and medical purposes. There are whole communities that are engaged in the collection and selling of this rare and precious fungi. They are unique as they are parasitic in nature and require a host caterpillar to reproduce. They are found around the altitude of 3500 m. They are insanely expensive such that a single kilogram of these rare fungi can cost around $130,000 in the international market. It also has many health benefits like curing respiratory problems like tuberculosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc. Not only that, but they also have the ability to cure and prevent heart problems.
Nepal is also extremely famous for khukuris. Khukuri is a machete-type weapon which is commonly associated with Gurkha warriors of Nepal. It can be easily recognised because of its distinct curve. Gurkha warriors are extremely famous for their fearless military prowess and excellent performance in two world wars. Due to this reputation of Gurkhas, the value of khukuri has skyrocketed as a souvenir for a knife enthusiast. Small khukuris are also commonly used for cutting and chopping purposes.
Thangka is a type of scroll painting in which a picture of Buddhist deity or a mandala is inscribed. These types of paintings are considered holy and pure in Tibetan Buddhist communities. A thangka can cost from Rs 1,000 to more than Rs 100,000, depending on the process it was made and material used. They are more commonly found in Buddhist houses where they are used for worshipping. Thangkas are also considered as one of the most beautiful forms of art. Many people who are not Buddhists also keep these thangkas in their home to admire their beauty.
Pashmina is considered the softest, fluffy, and highly delicate fibres. These fibres are made with Himalayan goat extract and are also known as diamond fibres. There are varieties of pashmina found in Nepal and the most popular one is known as Nepali Pashmina.

Nepal to give on-arrival visas to foreigners if they coordinate with travel agencies in advance,"Tuesday, September 29, 2020","Kathmandu, September 29
Further relaxing restrictions imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus in the country, the government of Nepal has decided to issue on-arrival visas to foreign tourists and trekkers under certain conditions.
Foreigners from the countries where there are Nepali diplomatic missions to issue visas should acquire visas in their own countries before flying to Nepal, Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation informs, adding those from other countries, however, can come to Nepal without obtaining visas in advance.
Nevertheless, they need to coordinate with travel and trekking agencies in Nepal, which will ask the Department of Immigration, via Nepal Tourism Board or Department of Tourism, to issue on-arrival visas for them, according to the notice.
All tourists coming to Nepal, carrying pre-acquired or on-arrival visas, should present a PCR negative test certificate and documents certifying booking of a hotel for seven-day quarantine upon arrival.
Likewise, they should also have an insurance of minimum USD 5,000.
The foreigners are required to undergo another PCR test for coronavirus on the fifth day of quarantine, testing negative in which only will qualify them for trekking and mountaineering activities.

10 things not to do while trekking in Nepali Himalayas,"Saturday, September 26, 2020","Trekking is one of the most fun and adventurous activities you can do in Nepal. It is one of the top reasons why tourists come here. In Nepal, due to its geographical location, you can find a lot of difficult terrains and venture through them.
Trekking can be adventurous and full of adrenaline. However, there are things you should not do while trekking in Nepali Himalayas. Since you will be in remote areas of Nepal, trekking should never be taken lightly; it does not take long for a trip to go wrong. Plus, taking caution means you will get an adventure you will remember for a lifetime.
So, here are some things that you should never ever do while trekking in Nepal:
You may be an adrenaline junkie or even an experienced trekker. Even if you feel confident and are familiar with the terrain, do not ever embark on a trek alone. Not only is this against the policy of the Nepal government, but it is also very risky and dangerous because you can easily get lost or even die from preventable causes like altitude sickness or even exhaustion. It is also advised to hire a trekking guide because that will make your trek a lot more enjoyable and easier. Safety comes first.
Another safety tip is not to walk on the edges while trekking. Majority of deaths that occur during a hike or trek happen due to falling, so it is better to be safe than sorry. Always walk on the safer side. Do not joke around or pull stunts or take photos at the edges for a better landscape photo. Also, take your trek slow and avoid overtaking anything. If you see an animal, which is common in treks around Upper Mustang and Upper Dolpo, let those animals pass first.
Trekking in the Nepali Himalayas will be much easier when you travel light. Overpacking your backpack is not advised while travelling. It is important to pack your bags according to your travelling days and destinations. Too many clothes, food items will cause your backpack to be heavy, and, as a result, you will feel tired very easily as you will have to walk uphill with the load.
When you overpack, you will need to hire additional porters/mules; this only costs you more. So, pack only as much as you can carry even for an extended amount of time.
One, because you do not know the source of the stream; it may actually carry a lot of disease-carrying germs that cause gastroenteritis or even diarrhoea, cholera, etc. Two, your body might not agree with water from such (foreign) sources; so even if you see locals drinking from those sources, avoid it.
It is advised to carry bottled water with you and refill from trusted sources. If you do not have options, first filter or boil it before consumption. You can also carry portable microfilters or drinking straws to avoid the germs.
Many trekking routes do not have enough shops so you might be tempted to pack and consume packaged junk foods. But, be careful and do not consume such junk foods, like noodles and chips, during your trek. It may also cause indigestion, which is extremely common in higher altitudes, and likely to ruin your trip.
With every day of demanding a physical journey, you will need a proper amount of nutrition. Choose healthier options like whole wheat pancakes, oatmeal with nuts, and butter for breakfast. You can also carry low-fat energy bars and sports drinks for the trip. Keep a routine and a regular check on your consumption.
Not all bacteria are harmful, those bacteria in your intestinal tract are extremely useful as they help you with digestion. But, as you go higher in altitude, the bacteria living in your digestive system will start to die due to lack of oxygen, causing several sicknesses and disorders which will totally ruin your trek.
Carry some probiotics in order to be able to digest food properly so they are able to provide you with energy that you require to keep going.
If you are on a trek, covering your ears is not a good idea since it is considered to be a good indicator of the atmosphere. You need your ear to balance while walking too; it will be more crucial while walking on high altitudes and unfamiliar terrains. Cover your ears with your jacket cap; it will be enough to protect yourself from the wind.
Of course, if you are trekking in the mountains or in the winter season, you will feel the need to keep yourself warm. Use mufflers or caps to not expose them, but still make sure you are not covering them fully so that you cannot even hear anything.
When you are in a foreign environment, you might have problems maintaining your old habits. Your body takes time to acclimatise, so give it some time. It is extremely important you try to maintain a regular pattern of doing everything, even in unfavourable times.
This means drinking the proper amount of water, eating the proper amount of food, and getting a proper amount of rest is very important. Even while walking, try to keep yourself hydrated and take note of your fatigue, drink water, eat food, and take rest even if you are not feeling any discomfort to not overstrain yourself.
When you decide to go trekking, you have to remember that things will not be like home. You will have a hard time finding pharmacies in higher altitudes. So, you will have to manage accordingly and need to carry your regular medicines, enough for all of your journey. It is recommended to carry a first-aid kit and your regular medicines if you are consuming any medicines for your allergies. Along with this, medicines for diarrhoea and constipation are also recommended as digestive problems are very common in higher altitudes while trekking.
It is nature that helps us detox both physically and mentally. And, that would not be possible without a clean environment. So, ensure that we need to make sure that we do not litter the surrounding. Things disposed at that high do not get collected on time, they also do not decompose and pollute the environment.
As an alternative, you can carry some eco-friendly products instead of things like sunscreen, lip balm, toothpaste or even toiletries and plastics. They contain harmful chemicals that should be avoided at all costs in the Himalayas.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/things-not-to-do-while-trekking-in-nepali-himalayas.html,travel
Nepal Tourism board to host ‘travel marts’ in provinces to revive industry,"Thursday, September 24, 2020","Kathmandu, September 24
In its bid to gradually revive the country’s tourism industry hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, Nepal Tourism Board has decided to host ‘travel marts’, travel and tourism promotion events, in six of the seven provinces in the fiscal year (before mid-July 2021).
Gandaki, which includes Pokhara, arguably the country’s tourism capital, however, will not have province-level events.
The board has included a plan to host different travel marts in six provinces of the country. The events will aim at exploring the tourism potential of each province and market that potential as a tourism product. These events can help revive both international and domestic tourism industries, claims the board.
The board has allocated Rs 2 million for each of the events.
The board will coordinate with federal and provincial governments to organise such events.
Here is a list of the proposed events:",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tourism-board-to-host-travel-marts-in-provinces-to-revive-industry.html,travel
"Going to Annapurna region? First, go to Dhampus instead","Monday, September 21, 2020","It is Dhampus where you can get the best view of the Annapurna range without going to the Annapurna region—so writes the Lonely Planet.
Small wonder, the claim the local Dhampus folks make their small village-town offers one of the most commanding panoramas of the entire Annapurna massifs, is no idle gossip. So, if Dhampus is not on your bucket list when you plan a visit to Pokhara next—add it. It’s just a piddling 25 km away from the Lake City.
After a holidaying spree in Pokhara, if you fancy escaping a little away from the city to a quiet unsullied rustic countryside, this small Gurung village goes one better. This village is snugly tucked away on a brow of a hill punctuated by verdant forest and farmland that grows corn, millet, and buckwheat to velvety rice terraces (with the onset of monsoon) rippling down to the narrow Mardi river valley. If it is peak summer, the elevation of the Dhampus is a pleasantly cool 1,650 m as against the sultry and humid 827 m of Pokhara into the bargain. What’s more, you can travel to the place either by a vehicle, motorbike or take a two-hour leisurely hike from a place called Phedi, a 20-minute drive from Pokhara city on the Baglung Highway; or for that matter as a choice, pedal it on two wheels. Hikers will find the winding foot-trail uphill cut across terraced fields, wooded hills, and tiny villages like Jamuné, Dharné, and Pokharé.
The hike is rated moderate, recommended for people of all ages. When my family and I hiked, we ran into an eight-year-old Canadian kid taking it all in his stride along with his parents.
What strikes you as the absolute stunner when you arrive in Dhampus, before all else, is the northern skyline. The staggering snow-clad array includes the 7th and the 8th highest peaks in the world, the Dhaulagiri (8,167 m) and the Manaslu (8,156m), followed by the entire shebang: the Annapurna I (8,091 m),  Annapurna II (7,937 m), Annapurna IV (7,525m), Hiunchuli (6,441m), Ganesh Himal (7,446m), Lamjung Himal(6,586m), and the Machhapuchhre (Fishtail Mountain: 6,993 m) in its iconic two-pronged glory.
Given a clear day, you can peer into the distance the Lake Phewa and the sprawling valley of Pokhara from the view-tower built on a hilltop above the Dhampus Bazaar.
“Looking back, Dhampus, once (before the Pokhara- Baglung Highway opened) served as the only trekking route to the Annapurna trek hotspots such as Ghorepani, Ghandruk, Poonhill, the epics like the ABC (Annapurna Base Camp), the MBC (Machhapuchhre Base Camp), and the Annapurna Sanctuary. Even the remote outpost then, the gateway to Mustang, Jomsom had to be accessed through Dhampus,” said Ananta Prasad Bhandari when I met him eight years ago during a hike to Dhampus. He ran the Green View Restaurant in Pothana Deurali, some 25 minutes from the town square.
Although a dirt road was built sometime in 2009, the village remained unblemished by the trappings of development when last I visited Dhampus in 2018 on my mountain bike from Pokhara. The presence of old slate-roofed mud and stone houses on the lush hillsides, cultivated smallholdings, untouched woodland, and that calm laidback ambience, all spoke for themselves.
Cycling from Pokhara to the hill-town can thrill an avid biker every inch. The going can be tough as the dirt-road after Phedi steeply climbs for an unrelenting eight kilometres to the village-town. The return trip, however, offers an adrenaline-pumping ‘shredding’ downhill. Among many foreign visitors to Dhampus, some like to venture out on mountain bikes, too. Mountain bikes can be hired conveniently from several shops at Hallan Chowk, the Lakeside, Pokhara.
“The Dhampus trail remained brisk almost around the year with foreign backpackers, village people, and a sprinkling of domestic weekenders. But, things changed. With the Baglung Highway in operation, the number, however, dropped drastically as newer trekking routes to the Annapurna range opened,” Ananta added.
“With the growing number in domestic tourists in the recent years coupled with the opening of the trekking route to the Mardi Himal (5,587 m, to the south flank of the Machhapuchre) in the Annapurna region (7,600 sq. km), things have started to look up, however,” explained Ananta.
For a small village town, Dhampus hosts a plethora of hotels and lodges.  Reservations can be made from Pokhara; failing, roadside hotel signboards help take your pick. Almost all hotels have access to the internet and running hot and cold water. The hotel tariff is moderately priced to suit your pocket from Rs 600.00 to 2,500 per night.
When it comes to food, it is a mélange of the East and the West—from basic dal-bhat, roti-veg-curry to burgers and sizzling steaks. Access by a vehicle to Dhampus is equally a cinch. Bolero jeeps and buses shuttle from Pokhara to Dhampus and back.
If you are travelling by your vehicle, motorbike, or bicycle, slow down at Hemja (11 km from Pokhara) and keep watching the rolling lush hilltops to your left. Shortly, at a certain point, you will observe the wooded hills to your left curiously transform into the silhouette of a reclining Buddha facing the sky.
If you want more than a fleeting glance (you can catch a glimpse from a bus window, too, if you happen to be on the left side), stop and capture it on your camera or mobile phone. Most people do not know about the reclining Buddha or miss out on it.
An overnight stay is recommendable if you plan to hike or take a ride. The best time to view the mountains is at sunrise unhindered by clouds or haze.  Dhampus’s jewels in the crown are the mountains. There’s nothing like catching the sun as it sheds its first rays on the snow-clad peaks.
For that, you have to be an early riser. All you got to do is ask the hotel attendant for a wake-up call with tea if you prefer. If you are bent on having a clear view of the lofty peaks, the best time to visit Dhampus is October-November.
But, other times of the year except for mid-monsoon also suit fine, and the little village-town may offer you a view of the mountain range—if luck favours you. The summer, on the other hand, can be a pleasant retreat to escape from the hot and clammy weather of Pokhara to a bucolic setting.
Once comfortably checked into a hotel, take a stroll to the bazaar and stop by a nearby fabled pond called Neghu Baraha. A small temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu (the Preserver of the Universe), stands by the historic pool. The locals aside, the shrine attracts devotees from far and near who come to worship and see the legendary pond for themselves.
Also, ancient watering hole visited by wild animals from the nearby dense forest, the pond is frequented by cattle and birds to drink from or to take a dip. That is not all. The pool carries an ancient myth, which is nothing short of a mystery.
“This venerated pond remains clean of leaves and fallen twigs all around the year. The trees shed leaves and dead twigs on the water, more so in winter. It’s but natural.  But, come afternoon, the birds that flock by the tree pick the fallen leaves and twigs off the water. It’s been like this since the time of our great grandfathers—and theirs,” Dev Kaji Gurung, a hotel owner, shed light on the mystery. It sounded strange to me, if not incredible.
I was a little sceptical the first time (I have been to Dhampus five times).  On each visit, I made it a point to look in on the pond. I would thoroughly scan the small pool for any sign of a leaf here or a twig there, but curiously I found the water spotless even though trees with outstretched branches stood at the fringe.
If you love jungle, try next, the eco-park built in the memory of great stalwarts of Nepal’s wildlife and conservation, late Dr Harkha Gurung, Dr Chandra Gurung, and Mingma Norbu Sherpa (all three died together in a helicopter crash).  The Park Forest is home to abundant wild orchids and wildlife.
The fashion fever of the cities has taken a firm grip on the youngsters of Dhampus, too. Boys and girls walked the streets sporting jeans and skirts, some with headphones tucked into their ears. When I last visited the quintessential Gurung town, it was for me sight for sore eyes to observe elders still not broken away from tradition. I ran into a Tamu (Gurung) gentleman in a typical native white bhangra (a product from sisnu or nettle-brush fibres) held by a wide cummerbund, and a waist-coat. As he wore a ubiquitous Nepali Bhadgaunle (from Bhaktapur) topi (cap), a white cotton sack-bag slung across his chest in a crisscross—a rare sight these days.
Gurung women dressed more elaborately or generously with a phariya (sari) or a tubular pleated skirt, a blouse (blue-black or maroon-coloured) tied at the front, a cummerbund, a shawl, and a head-cover. During festivities, they are laden with jewellery that includes gold, coral, or glass-bead necklaces, earrings, nose-rings, bracelets, and bangles. For the un-used eye, the earrings look way too big to weigh heavily on the delicate earlobes. They are not. In truth, they are paper-thin, only the size belies their lightweight.
Next, a short hike to Pothana (1,974 m) can be a refreshing break, 25 minutes away up across a wooded hill. The trail, largely flight of stone steps, runs through the lush forest that includes oak, magnolia, rhododendron, chandan (sandalwood), needle-wood, and pine. The forest glades that intercept add to the charm. The woods offer sungabha or orchids galore, sprouting from moss and lichen-covered tree boughs and branches.
Bird watchers, trust my words! Gateway to ACAP (Annapurna Conservation Area Project) with the reputation of being a refuge for over 500 species of birds, the dense forest promises good sightings.  The jungle is home to rare species like the hoary-throated barwing, the spectacled finch, and if Lady Luck smiles on you, the elusive endemic spiny babbler (Kande Bhyakur in Nepali; found only in Nepal), among many others. Better keep your binoculars handy!
More surprises may lie in wait for the unsuspecting hikers as coveys of pheasants may startle them by crossing their path and scurry away for cover. On the other, lone barking deer might saunter by. The thick forest is also home to the common leopards, only active nocturnally, though.
With the onset of March-April, the forest turns into a riot of colours as rhododendrons in full bloom blanket the forested hills. “Dhampus is home to six varieties of rhododendron: red, purple, white, pink, deep red, and maroon,” said Ananta.
After Pothana, a 20-minute walk up an unbroken forest chain brings you to the Australian Camp. Clusters of tiny settlements, lodges, homestays, and tea houses mark the place. What stands out most is a large green turf that faces the Annapurna range. Curiously, the local story has it, way back, the place previously known as Thulo Kharka (big pasture), came to be called the Australian Camp after a visiting Australian backpacker laid on the vacant plot grass-seeds brought from his country.
If you can extend a day or two, you can strike off to Ghandruk (another much-talked Gurung village).  After Pothana, the trail winds its way along a forested ridge traversing Gurung villages like Pitam Deurali, Tolka, and Landrung. The high crest offers a staggering view of the Modi river valley to its west.
If your wanderlust drives you even farther, a three-four day trek from Ghandruk takes you to the ABC (Annapurna Base Camp) and MBC (Machhapuchare Base Camp). For that, you need a trained guide and logistic support available both in Dhampus and Ghandruk. The package can also include the Annapurna Sanctuary if you wish.
History has it, Dhampus, previously called Tome Le (meeting ground or even fisticuffs in Gurung dialect), once served as a Chaubise Rajya (one among 24 district principalities) said to be ruled by Khas kings.
After Prithvi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne in 1734, he annexed those petty states under his unification of Nepal. Ambar Gurung, owner, the Hotel Paradise View, helped me with the info. The ruins of an old fort remain at a wooded hillock called the Kot (Fort), 20 minutes from the town square. A shrine of Bhagawati stands next to the ancient ruins. The Dhampus people celebrate Dashain by offering goats and buffaloes for sacrifice to this deity.
If you are on a hike with a one-night stay, instead of back-tracking the same route, try the trail back via Dhikur Pokhari to Sarangkot or Kandé. It is worth the sweat, as the trail winds down forested hills and a beautiful stretch of country. From Kandé, you can catch a bus to Pokhara.
Every destination is known and recalled for its history, ambience, local folklore, and landscape. So it is by its local flavour, too: food. So, make a day of it by trying a dash of the local exotica: the millet dhindo (cooked dough), lamb sukuti (dried meat), locally grown sag (spinach), and if you do not mind trying the local aperitif, the jhwainkhatte (a blend of millet alcohol poured into a sizzling pan of rice grain fried in ghee). Do be warned, though—if one too many, you will either hit the bed straight or the hard floor!
In 2018, while on a mountain bike ride to Dhampus, I stopped on my way back by the Neghu Baraha. But lo behold, I failed to locate any trace of floating leaves or twigs on the surface—instead, two stout buffaloes wallowing in the water stared back at me with their doleful bovine expression. Fact or myth, perhaps you would like to find it out for yourself!

10 things every traveller should do in Nepal,"Saturday, September 19, 2020","Visiting Nepal is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When you are visiting another country for a vacation, you most probably will want to experience everything that the country has to offer. Nepal indeed has a lot of enticing experiences for you. From paragliding to climbing the tallest mountain in the world, there are lots of things in Nepal you might not want to miss during your trip.
Among that plethora of experiences, here are 10 things every traveller should do in Nepal for an ultimate Nepal-visiting experience:
You will most probably be entering Nepal through Kathmandu because the only international airport is located here. In such a case, going sightseeing around the Kathmandu valley might be the first thing you might want to do. This will also be the best thing to do on day 1 of your Nepal visit as you might be too exhausted to do something more adventurous.
Different parts of the valley are famous for various things. Starting from religious sites like Bouddhanath Stupa, Swayambhu Stupa and Pashupatinath Temple to tourist hubs like Thamel and Durbar Marg, you can explore the bests of Kathmandu. As for Lalitpur, Patan Durbar Square is the place to start. If you want to see the historical, cultural and religious side of the valley, another stop is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Other places to stop are Changu Narayan Temple, the oldest temple in Nepal, and Godavari Botanical Garden with different types of flora and fauna.
Any visit to Nepal will not be complete until and unless you come to Pokhara and engage in multitudes of adventurous activities this city has to offer. Pokhara is considered the hottest tourist destination in Nepal. There are many religious places you can visit including Tal Bahari Temple, Bindhyabasini, World Peace Stupa, etc. as well as many natural spots like Phewa Lake, Begnas and Rupa Lake along with Mahendra Cave, and Devi’s Falls.
For adventure lovers, Pokhara offers one of the best experiences for paragliding and ultralight flights. Zip flyer, skydiving and hand gliding are other great options in Pokhara. Or, relax and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Machhapuchhre and Mount Annapurna among others while air blows all around you. You can also choose to ride through various bike trails around the city and break some sweat. If you are feeling more adventurous, trekking to mountain peaks and their base camps is also an option.
Nepal is a country gifted with lots of water resources. The perennial rivers that come from many mountain ranges in Nepal are famous for rafting. Rivers like Bhote Koshi, Trishuli, Kali Gandaki, Sun Koshi are more popular. However, Bhote Khosi river is best for rafting and kayaking, and Trisuli river is best for canoeing due to its adventures. Another great water sport would be a stand-up paddle in Pokhara. This is the perfect thing to do if you ever visit Nepal and you are adventure enthusiasts.
Other than water sports, there are many things that you can do in Nepal in terms of adventure sports. Starting with the biking trails in Kathmandu, its lesser-known trails, hills and forests are perfect for biking enthusiasts. Mountain bikes are easily available in Kathmandu if you want to explore its exquisite landscape.
For the adrenaline rush, you can also go bungee jumping or canyon swing; Bhote Koshi Gorge and Hemja in Pokhara are the best places for the sports respectively. You might also be interested in rock climbing at Nagarjun Forest Reserve as it is beginner-friendly and also good for the professional ones. Also, you can always visit The village of Humde in Annapurna region for ice climbing.
Nepal, though small, has many famous national parks with rich biodiversity in flora and fauna. Chitwan National Park is the oldest and one among the not-to-be-missed places you can visit during your Nepal visit. Wildlife safari is one of the most famous activities in the park, where you can get unforgettable experience to witness one-horned rhinoceros, royal Bengal tigers, ghariyals, peacocks, musk deers, kingfisher, brahminy duck and paradise flycatcher, etc. You can do this by riding on elephants or on jeeps. Animal rights activists have been discouraging elephant riding these days though.
Near the park, you can also visit the Elephant Breeding Centre to learn more about them, feed them, and help them be preserved as they are becoming one of the most endangered animals in the world. You can even go for an elephant bathing in Sauraha and get the opportunity for a dip and dive with the elephants. Not only that you can also enjoy ox and pony rides or go for boating along the Rapti river. The cultural stick-and-peacock dances are not to be missed.
Mountain climbing is also another option for you since Nepal is the home of eight of the highest mountains in the world. Nepal is famous for its astounding trekking routes of paradise. Annapurna and Everest are the two most popular trekking routes in Nepal. Everest trek starts from Lukla which can be reached by flight accompanied by the jaw-dropping view of Dudh Koshi valley. Likewise, the Annapurna hike offers you with the gorgeous mountains, hot springs and delightful farming village.
If you do not want to choose an extreme peak like Mt Everest, you can always go for Kanchenjunga or Lhotse to enjoy mountaineering experience. Yala Peak, Chulu West Peak, Pisang Peak and Island Peak are other few of the peaks that do not have much height but give you the thrill nevertheless.
If you are not into mountain climbing, but still want to enjoy the stunning view of Mount Everest, a helicopter flight might be perfect for you. This will not be as exciting as mountain climbing or trekking, but the view of the world’s tallest mountain will be a jaw-dropping sight. You will be soaring through the air over the Himalayan range up close, with the view of peaks like Gaurishankar, Cho-Oyu, Lhakpa Dorje and many others will be one of the best things you will do in your life.
In east Nepal, you can visit Ilam to feel the pleasant scent of tea leaves ever-present in the air. Ilam is one of the most beautiful tea gardens in the world. Also, the tea produced in this place is regarded as one of the best teas in Nepal. Weather in this place is also very mild and very favourable. One can calm down and enjoy some tea. While you are staying there, you can also taste some of the best Ilam teas and their varieties including Nepali spiced tea, Nilgiri tea or even organic Himalayan tea.
Lumbini is one of the most religiously and historically important sites in Nepal. Lumbini is the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and has many ancient temples. Maya Devi Temple here is regarded as the place where Gautam Buddha was born. Other than that, the major places to visit are Ashoka Pillar, Eternal Peace Flame, Holy Pond, etc.
Lumbini also has a multitude of monasteries and holds high importance in Buddhist rituals every year. Buddhist monks often sit under the tree meditating and chanting spiritual scripts. Not only that, but you can also visit amazing monasteries located here made by people from Germany, Nepal and China, Myanmar, and Vietnam. All have intricate architectural designs with high Influence of Buddhism.
If you are in Nepal, you must try Nepali cuisine, as it reflects the Nepali culture most tastefully. There are so many dishes available with its amazing blend and lip-smacking flavours. Staple foods like dal-bhat and dhindo are popular and healthy ones. These foods are best served with gundruk ko jhol (fermented leafy green pickles) or meat curry.
Other famous food includes Newari food items like samaybaji, chatamari, chhoila, etc. They all are a great option when it comes to cultural cuisines, and you cannot have enough.
If you are craving for local street foods, you can also try momo, chhoila, etc. or try some Indian snacks like pani-puri, chatpatay, and samosa, which are widely available in Nepal. You can always visit Bhaktapur for some authentic, delicious Juju Dhau (yoghurt) for some sweetness. You can also go for a food tour to eat different kinds of food items on your trip or go around to taste the same kind of food from different places. Both will be an unforgettable experience for you.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/things-every-traveller-should-do-in-nepal.html,travel

And, if you are looking forward to visiting Nepal, there are a few places that you should surely not miss. Some of the places have unique and adorable destinations while in some cases the whole city becomes a travel destination.
Below are 10 of such places that you should visit in Nepal in your lifetime.
Kathmandu, the capital city, is as vibrant as it is upbeat. So whether it is your first time or not, make sure to go around the city. From many World Heritage sites to cosy, vibrant restaurants and cafes, you will be welcomed with an array of things that will keep you entertained and make your stay worthwhile. Some of the major attractions include Basantapur Durbar Square, Swayambhunath Stupa, but you can walk around the alleys and courtyards that reflect the real essence of the city.
Adjacent to Kathmandu, and with the equally vibrant community is Lalitpur. If you are in Kathmandu, you have to visit this city too. Like a sister to Kathmandu, Lalitpur also shares the culture, festivals and the welcoming group of communities that reflect the essence of Nepali culture. The city is also known for its rich art and cultural history as well as entrepreneurial ventures that have taken shelter in the area. You can start your trip from Patan Durbar Square and from there enhance your experience by going around.
Another adjoining city is Bhaktapur. This city is somewhat different from the two aforementioned. Unlike the two, urbanisation has not really flourished here, meaning if you are to visit Bhaktapur, you are likely to get the real essence of what Nepali culture is like. The city is also inhabited by one of the oldest communities of the country, Newars. Their distinct identity is reflected well on their houses and art as well as food and language. Any turn you take is sure to give you that experience, but you can start from Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Apart from the three cities, the most popular destination for tourists is the city of Pokhara. Established as the tourist hub of Nepal, you can go around the city for adventure, relax at the lakeside, shopping and even enjoy the number of extreme sports available from trekking to skydiving.
Being the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha, Lumbini sees a large number of religious tourists. Like Pokhara, it also receives a high number of tourists every year. Not only Buddhists, but tourists of all religions also come here to pay their homage to Lord Buddha and seek peace. Around Lumbini, there are many monasteries that you can visit. All of them have religious importance and outstanding architectural design that one can appreciate and enjoy.
Famous as the place above the clouds, Muktinath in Mustang is also one of the highly popular destinations to visit in Nepal. It is not just the destination, but travelling along long dirt roads leading to Jomsom is an experience in itself too. The place is famous for its apples and special Marpha breweries. The place has a unique blend of Himalayan communities and presents you with local Thakali food experience that should not be missed. The trek to Lo-Manthang (pass) is also something you can dive into.
As the lake at the highest altitude in Nepal, Tilicho in Manang has attracted a lot of tourists and trekkers alike. A trek to Tilicho Lake and Thorung-La pass is one of the most thrilling adventures. After reaching the destination, the scenic beauty and its majestic view is a totally different experience. Walking through the Gunsang settlement and other local settlements, you can experience different kinds of culture and their food including cheese, dhindo and khoo, among others.
The list of top places to visit in Nepal can surely not miss Gosainkunda. The place, in Rasuwa, has high religious and cultural importance and is a famous destination for all tourists. The Langtang trekking route by this place sees many trekkers every year. It is one of the riskiest trekking routes too.
Rara is one of the major tourist destinations popular among both domestic and international tourists. The lake is majestically beautiful and provides its visitors with a panoramic view of the Himalayas. Trekking to Rara is also one of the most sought after popular routes available. The lake lies inside the Rara National Park, the smallest national park in Nepal. Nevertheless, it houses about 500+ species of flora and 200+ fauna, making it perfect for the nature lovers and bird watchers alike.
Chitwan is a haven for culture and nature, which makes it among the most popular destinations in Nepal. Filled with Tharu culture, the place transports you to another universe within Nepal. It is more popular for having the Chitwan National Park that is the habitat of a wide range of flora and fauna. A settlement resides inside the park, so if you decide to stay in Sauraha, and if you are lucky, you will be delighted with animals, especially a rhino, just casually walking around the area. A few of the attractions also include the essence including their stick dance and other cultural performances. Be sure to not miss the jungle safari, boating in the Rapti River, and taste the local food.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/10-places-you-should-visit-in-nepal-in-your-lifetime.html,travel
Minister proposes two weekend holidays to promote domestic tourism,"Friday, September 11, 2020","Kathmandu, September 11
Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Yogesh Bhattarai, has proposed giving weekend holidays for two days every week so as to promote domestic tourism in the country.
Currently, the government holiday for the weekend is only Saturdays, but Bhattarai proposes Fridays should also be marked as holidays so that people can go on vacation on the weekends.
“It will give sufficient time for those willing to go on travel. It will be an important step in reviving the tourism industry (hit by the Covid-19 crisis),” Bhattarai says.
Because the coronavirus spread is likely to linger for the next few months across the world, the government has not hoped much foreigner footfall, hence the promotion of domestic tourism can be crucial to surviving the industry, he says.
The government is consulting private businesses and Nepal Tourism Board about possible programmes to promote domestic tourism, the minister informs.
Meanwhile, some entrepreneurs have commented that it was their mistake not to prioritise domestic visitors in the past.
“In the yesteryears, domestic tourists were largely ignored as we were after dollars. But now, we have realised our shortcoming,” Achyut Guragain, the president of the Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents, says, “Now, it is high time for us to correct ourselves.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/minister-proposes-two-weekend-holidays-to-promote-domestic-tourism.html,travel

Starting point: Nagarjuna GateDistance: 20 kilometresDuration: Minimum 4 hoursAltitude: 1,950 m
A hike to Nagarkot is one of the most preferred hiking trails for enthusiasts because of the views of the Himalayas it offers.

Meet the author of 4 books that help you know western Nepal,"Tuesday, September 8, 2020","Photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa thinks he exemplifies the Nepali proverb ‘Jaha pugdainan ravi, tyaha pugchhan kavi’ (Translation: Poets reach those places where the sunlight cannot). He has travelled from Taplejug in the east to Khaptad and Badimalika in the west. Thapa has managed to capture the scenes from the remote Upper Dolpo to Lumbini and Ramjanaki of the Terai in his camera.
Probably, he is among those few photojournalists who have visited every nook and corner of the country exploring the lifestyle, culture, scenic beauty, and suffering of the people of those places. Thapa has also managed to capture the images of Nepali people’s lifestyle, natural beauty, poverty and hunger in his camera. Due to his attachment to photography, he has visited 72 out of 77 districts in recent times.
Love for west

In particular, Thapa, a native of Dailekh, is more focused on western Nepal. In the past eight years, he published four photo books introducing touristic destinations of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.
“Although the potential for art, culture and tourism is immense in western Nepal, it has lagged behind due to lack of publicity,” Thapa says, “Realising this, I am active in introducing and promoting western Nepal through various means.” Thanks to this engagement, some people have called him ‘Paschim Chinyaune Abhiyanta’ (the campaigner to introduce western Nepal).
He has travelled through many long, risky and difficult journeys while capturing pictures. It used to be very difficult and uncomfortable to walk. Even though, Thapa used to enjoy looking at the picture captured inside his camera. Today, those journeys look so thrilling in the pictures.
He published his first book ‘Wild West Nepal’ in 2013 in which he has included the life, world, culture, and nature of the far-western and mid-western regions. “I went through a lot of things while travelling around the country. I couldn’t stay without archiving them,” he shares, “After my first book was published, I received so much love and praise from all my friends. I was inspired to publish another book.”
He informs, “Western Nepal is not only rich in natural beauty, but this part of the country also has cultural, religious and historical significance. My goal is to attract as many people as possible to my area.”

Not only this, but he has also prepared the tourist map of Bardiya National Park and Karnali province making it easier for the tourists.
Hope for future
Thapa feels western Nepal has been lagging behind other parts of the country in receiving tourists due to the lack of minimal infrastructures like proper and safe roads, transportation and hotels. Although due to the coronavirus crisis, the tourism industry is halted now, he believes that western Nepal could be the best travel destination for those who want to travel to a new destination after the situation returns to normal.
He is now planning to publish a photo book on western Nepal comprising the pictures of Province 5, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim. He suggests that it would be difficult to promote tourism in western Nepal unless tourism is managed unitedly in all three provinces.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bharat-bandhu-thapa-helps-you-know-western-nepal.html,travel
Manaslu circuit trek: Try it as soon as you can,"Saturday, September 5, 2020","No doubt, you have heard people say “You should have come here five years ago.”  What they mean is great tourist destinations change quickly and even in a short time, things change, usually not for the better!  I would like to introduce you to the Manaslu circuit trek this way.
Outranking Annapurna Base Camp in terms of popularity among those of us ‘in the know’, Manaslu circuit can be considered one of the best treks in Nepal.  Hence, I recently did this trek. I have an ideal 13-day itinerary for the Manaslu circuit trek you can follow, Kathmandu to Kathmandu.  Let me give you some details.
The boring bit!
Get yourself to the Dhading Bus Park  (why do they still call it ‘new’?).  Then, get on a local bus to Soti Khola.  Actually, you have to get a bus to Arughat, then change to another bus or jeep to Soti Khola.  It takes around six hours to reach Arughat, then another hour to reach Soti Khola.
I recommend you reach the bus park early in the morning so you can reach Arughat in the early afternoon.  If you are lucky, there will be other adventurers on the bus.  Definitely, you will want someone to talk to on the way.  But, maybe not during the bumpy rough last hour from Arughat to Soti Khola.  It is difficult enough to hold on to the seat as the bus leaps from pothole to pothole, so never mind trying to hold a conversation!   If you have a group of friends, you can always hire a private jeep from Kathmandu. But, where is the fun in that?
The trek begins
After a good sleep, I start walking north towards the source of the Budhi Gandaki river. Currently, you are in Gorkha, but after crossing the Larkya La Pass, you will be in Manang. If you want to save a few hours at the start, there is an under-construction road that takes you from Soti Khola to Machha Khola.  You will have to hire a local jeep though.
I am not sure whether there is a regular jeep service currently, but I am sure it will come in the future.  In the meantime, it is a relatively easy four-hour walk to Machha Khola where you can stop for the night unless you are hardcore and can push towards the next village.  But, I stop in Machha Khola where the accommodation is the last ‘good’ room I have on the trek!
The next day is long – seven hours from Machha Khola to Jagat, but there are waterfalls, an interesting cliff painting of Buddha and hot springs on the way!  Here, you also enter the Manaslu Conservation Area.
Walking on from Jagat to Dyang, there are more waterfalls to admire, suspension bridges to cross, and landslides to negotiate with.  Not my favourite part! The whole trail basically follows the Budhi Gandaki river, which is gorgeous!  On this day, I also meet trekkers who have done a side trip into the Tsum valley.  By now, the altitude is rising, and the temperature is dropping, but it is not yet too cold to make you suffer!  At Namrung, there is a fancy hotel with a bakery. Needless to say, I do not stay in that lodge, but buy some goodies in the bakery.
My favourite part
My favourite part of the trek is between Namrung and Samdo, which takes four days, including an acclimatisation day.  Now, the whole landscape is reminiscent of Tibet and the people are all wearing Tibetan-style dresses. I love the village of Lho and highly recommend you stay a night there.  Aside from the friendly villagers and cute wooden cottage I stay in, it is here I can see the best sunset and sunrise.
Somewhere between Lho and Sama Gaun, it might have been at Shyala village, I bump into runners doing the Manaslu Mountain Trail Race.  If you think you are fit enough and this is for you, check it out!  It is a high-altitude trail race held in November every year.   I am happy just to watch them rush on by.
Then, I wander at a more leisurely pace on to Birendra lake at Sama Gaun.   Here at Sama Gaun, it is recommended you take an acclimatisation day before climbing higher.  There is plenty to do on the so-called rest day – you can hike to Manaslu Base Camp or to Pungen Gompa.
Then, the trail takes you on to Samdo.  Some people might want to acclimatise again here, but I move on, pushing acclimatization to the next day at Dharmashala—a tough, sometimes icy, walk, but not a long one.  By now, the weather is very cold and probably very windy.  Thank goodness for the warm kitchen at the lodge!
Larke Pass and homebound
This is a big day.  Get up early, say at 4, and climb the Larke Pass at 5,167 m. It is dark, slippery and cold, but the views and sense of achievement are well worth it!  Then, it is a long walk with no teashops until you are around an hour out of Bimthang were I stay the night.
The final-day trek is a long downhill hike to Dharapani along the banks of the Dudh Khola in parts. Then, it is a three-hour bumpy jeep ride to Beshi Sahar and a microbus back to Kathmandu.
Best time to go and difficulties
Definitely, the best time to go to Manaslu circuit is mid-September to mid-December.  But it is also good from the end of March to mid-May.
The Manaslu circuit trek is a bit more difficult than the average treks in the Annapurnas.  But, like any hike at altitude, the key is not to rush.  For this reason, it is very important to take an acclimatising day (or two) at Sama Gaun.  If you do like to travel fast, you can do this safely from Bimthang onwards.
How much does it cost?
It is not too expensive when you consider that you are in a beautiful and pristine environment!
I suggest you allocate Rs 2,000 per day,  plus Rs 3,000 for transportation. But, do take extra cash with you as there are no ATMs or banks on this route!
Insider hints and tips
I want to give you some tips on how to get the most out of this trip.
So, as I said at the beginning of this post,  best get to the Manaslu circuit trek sooner rather than later!  Happy trekking!

"Two cyclists’ lockdown escapade to Tamang Gaun, Jhor Mahankal (Part II)","Thursday, August 20, 2020","
(Read Part I)
At the Mahankal shrine, I stopped to ask around how far the Jaleshwor Mahadev was. Only a couple of houses appeared on the hillside but not a soul around. One house, in particular, took my fancy. Built with stone and brick, painted part white, the rest ochre with bunches of garlic hung to dry under the overhanging eaves of the roof, the compound was fenced in with a split bamboo screen—a typical rustic household that’s a rare sight in Kathmandu these days.
Just then, I spotted a young fellow coming up the incline our way; the locale seemed quiet and deserted, otherwise. “Close, maybe 20 minutes,” he said and, to our surprise, offered to show us to the place. Great, I said! We decided to visit Jaleswhor Mahadev first.
His name was Bikram Tamang, only 16 years old and studying in the 9th grade. As all schools remained closed following the lockdown, he stayed home and helped his parents tend their little land and hung around, at other times, with village friends.
He told us the ethnic Tamangs dominated the entire village and threw light on them. “They include the Bomjan, Sangtyang, Tu, Bhaiju, and Lo, to name a few.”
Shivapuri forest
As we got closer to the forested hill riding past a handful of settlements, my eyes caught sight of a wall way down, which seemed to skirt the wooded foothill. We learned from Bikram it served as the boundary wall dividing the buffer zone and the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park. “The Jaleshwor Mahadev lies within the park,” he explained.
The dense Shivapuri forest boasts both a temperate and a subtropical forest with different species of pine, alder, wild Himalayan cherry, and rhododendron, to name some. The fauna includes barking deer, pine marten, Kalij pheasant, clouded leopard, Himalayan black bears, and, besides, the native wild boars, their hefty Russian cousins (introduced in the 1970s as gifts to the then King Mahendra).
Released only in a pair in the Nagarjun forest, with time, those wild swine outnumbered their native counterparts to become a scourge of the villages surrounding the park walls (mostly where the walls have fallen apart, especially in Nagarjun) from Shivapuri to the Nagarjun areas. Almost three times the size of the native boars, they are more notorious for wreaking havoc on maize crops each harvest season.
With more than 300 species of birds, the forest is home to rare species like the hoary-throated barwing, white-throated tit, and the pride of the Shivapuri forest–the elusive spiny babbler (Kande Bhyakur in Nepali)—endemic species found only in Nepal.
The dirt road a little up the hill met a single track that led north, closer to the Shivapuri forest. After a short spin on the single track, we dismounted and walked our bikes; Bikram fell into stride with us.  Just then, my eyes fell upon wild fruiting shrubs with stems holding some berries. The trail seemed lined up with them.
At a closer look, I figured they were wild golden raspberries (ainselu). Shayeet also spotted them and cried out, “Wow, ainselu,” and hastened to launch himself upon them. “Ouch, darned thorns got me,” he yelled out. Bikram and I had a good laugh.
Next, we got busy picking them up.  Bikram, an old hand, was quick on the uptake. He picked by the handfuls and offered us. I did not remember how much I gorged on them; never had I so much all my life. So did Shayeet—a grand treat from nature. I also spotted chutro or Indian barberry (Berberis aristata) shrubs along the trail.
“We are almost there,” Bikram said, after something like 20 minutes. There was a steep drop with uneven steps, so we left our bikes on the track and walked. The pre-monsoon had invited lush foliage—vines, ferns, lichen, and dense undergrowth. The damp rocks all around, encrusted with olive-green moss, reminded of velvety carpets.
“Nothing to fret over the bikes stolen,” assured Bikram. The computer (cyclometer) on my bike’s handlebar logged in the distance at 8.9 km from Milan Tole, Grande Hospital. “Only! I thought we’d done well over 15 km,” Shayeet sounded disappointed. It also felt at first to me we had done a great distance. Maybe it had to do with the hardy track, I mused.
The shrine looked scarcely visited even by the local folks, let alone the outsiders. The depression held a tiny cascade in a dark fern-covered cave-like hollow. A trident stood at the mouth as the crashing frothy water fed a narrow brook that dropped to a darkened ravine downhill.

The hill above held the dense Shivapuri forest in all its grandeur, shooting way up into the clouds. Sheer bliss! The surroundings seemed to await us—beckoning, reminding us of a stark contrast between civilisation and nature, pristine and unsullied–almost unbelievable in such close vicinity of the maddening metropolis.


Jaleshwor Mahadev
It barely took us five minutes to the Mahadev. My altimeter showed the elevation at 1,750m, a little higher than Kathmandu (1,400 m). As we got closer, I found it to be a concrete structure, almost like six feet tall. “It was placed only three years ago,” Bikram said. As I looked on, my eyes caught sight of, besides a crescent moon, the head of a female deity on Lord Shiva’s thick locks. Bikram had no clue about the she-god.

I figured that to be Goddess Parwati’s sister, Ganga, as Hindu epics like Mahabharata and Ramayan recount how Ganga came to occupy Shiva’s head. Going by the tantric tradition, it is also believed to be Goddess Tripura Sundari or Sati Devi. Both Ganga and Tripura Sundari happen to be Shiva’s consorts.
Small stone statues flanked Mahadev—Ganesh on the left and, to the best of my knowledge, his brother, Kartikeya on the right, but I could not be sure about the second as it appeared a little disfigured; a frilled silk canopy hung above. Bikram told us the shrine did not have an incumbent pujari. The entire locale looked hushed and deserted.
As a tall customary trident that held a damaru (a small two-headed drum closely associated with Lord Shiva) stood next to the statue, the ubiquitous Vasuki Nag (Hindu serpent-king), a Rudraksha (Elaeocarpus ganitrus) garland and others wound around his neck. And, as always, a little before Shiva, his devoted Vahan (vehicle), bull Nandi, squatted on its haunches, facing him. A large mirror, again very commonly found in Nepali temples, hung behind the Mahadev.
Folklore
Built on the local folklore, the Jaleshwor Mahadev’s discovery was a pure accident when some women who had gone into the woods to collect fodder for their cattle stumbled upon a set of three stones that resembled Shiva linga. Words soon travelled around the village. But before the villagers could further investigate, a local woodcutter happened to spot those stones.
He had heard the rumour regarding the stones. Gossips ran, he swung his axe on one of the stone scoffing at the villagers’ blind and foolhardy faith. That act of his proved fatal for the woodcutter who died a week later.
“Over and above, his entire family perished in a short period.  As the site had a waterfall and a pool, it came to be called the Jaleshwor Mahadev. The holy stones were shifted to the present spot for ease of access to the devotees and later, replaced by a statue,” Kanchha Tamang summed up.

It was past noon, and I was starving. “If you feel like it, there is a waterfall, a cave, and a small pool down there well worth seeing,” Bikram said and pointed down to a ravine. That sure looked scary to me. “Does a track lead down there?” asked Shayeet. Bikram nodded.
Shayeet followed Bikram down the steep grassy gradient, both hands grasping the long grasses, and whatever brush came his way. The track was barely visible, so all he did was tread on Bikram’s heels. Honestly, I wanted no part of it and chickened out—just watched from above. Before long, they got lost from my sight.
Whoa! Just then, thunder sounded, and grey clouds loomed overhead, completely shrouding the crest of the forested hill. And within seconds, to my worst fear, the raindrops began to fall. I worried about Shayeet as the steep drop might turn as slippery as an eel. One false step or a slip could spell disaster.
Long-grained
I counted my lucky stars, as Shayeet appeared with Bikram. He barely had time to take a couple of shots of the cascade, but instead of venturing further into the cave and to the ancient pool, made for a hasty retreat as he felt the droplets of rain. No sooner he came than the rain fell and within minutes started pouring. We looked around for some shelter and found the only shed that stood close by. Luckily, the door was not locked, and we barged in.
Lo behold, the small space inside the shack looked lived-in. As a bed lay in a corner, unmade and total disarray, the front had a traditional chulo (mud-stove) with pots and pans strewn around with some steel plates. Simply put, everything was in a complete mess.
We learned from Bikram a Babaji or sadhu was holed up there but most times wandered around. My eyes then fell on a plate, which held a little coarsely pounded dried grass. It turned out to be marijuana. No wonder, I saw quite a few wild hemp underbrushes on our way up.   “Shayeet, what say you? Want to try?” I just kidded around and chuckled. I knew he did not even smoke cigarettes. “Nah, no way,” he retorted.

“Time to eat, man. My stomach is screaming murder,” I lamented.  Our packed lunch included egg-fried rice, courtesy of Shayeet. He had brought the food for two, but we had to consider Bikram, too. It turned out, Shayeet, still a newbie when it came to cooking, had knocked up enough for three.
I could not believe the fried rice would taste so good. Shayeet had done a wonderful job. Bikram, too, seemed to relish it. He seemed a little baffled as he ate, though. “How come the rice is so long, lastai lamo chha (is extremely long; the word lastai has become viral in recent years in Nepal)?  I’ve never eaten this kind before,” he said to no one in particular and looked in all his sincerity. “It’s very common in town and is called the long-grain rice easily available in grocery stores,” I explained and truly felt sorry for him.
The downpour stopped suddenly, but dark clouds still hovered above, blanketing the hills. “Time to leave,” I called out, and we hit the trail back to Mahankal Devi. It turned out a couple of leeches had got Bikram on his bare feet since he wore slippers. Shayeet and I thought the leeches would not stand a chance as we had our shoes on. Wrong! My eyes suddenly fell on my right ankle and found my white sock bloody-red. Shayeet was unscathed, though.
Mahankal Devi

The premises at the local folks’ most revered shrine looked spacious and well-planned with concrete blocks for the floor. As a stone-spout stood at one corner, the entire area seemed to rest under the canopy of several trees. The main deity under the small temple’s tiled-roof gave the impression of a gaping mouth of a cave with a depth of some four feet.

At a closer look, it turned out a boulder no less the size of a car. I could not figure out if the orifice was a natural formation or hewed, and Bikram turned out none the wiser. Contrary to my expectation, the shrine did not hold any idol; only different stones occupied the cavity. As a string of bells hung from the roof, a trishul (trident) stood on one side.

“I seem to remember my grandfather say, the Mahankal Devi appeared in a mysterious manner,” explained the 77-year-old elderly gentleman, Kanchha Tamang. The story went like this. In something like 1,017 BS (before the end of the first millennium after Christ), sudden deaths in the village caused a rural uproar. The villagers were at their wit’s end when the deaths did not seem to let up.
A village assembly was summoned by, and tantric Dhami-jhãkris (shamans) sought. One of the shamans called Changé following the tantric ritual happened to communicate with the Mahankal Devi, who revealed to him the villagers had committed a sacrilege by littering her abode (present site) and failed to uncover her holy presence. That was the reason she had incurred her wrath upon the villagers.
“Thus, to appease the Mahankal Devi, villagers offered the sacrifice of goats, and chickens, and performed an illustrious puja pleading the Goddess for her mercy. Following that, the deaths in the village stopped as mysteriously as it began,” explained Kanchha Tamang. Every year, on the occasion of Saptami and Ashtami (7th/8th day) of Dashain, puja is held at the shrine with great religious fervour.
After the revered shrine of Jhor Mahankal, we bid Bikram good-bye and hit back home. I felt like saving Bikram’s number on my cell-phone just so to remember him by but was dumbstruck he did not own one.  As I spun down the hill, I debated in my mind even my grocer’s eight-year-old son fiddled around with his cell-phone. That was the second time I felt for him. Maybe, it was good for him, after all, I mused.

"Tourism-reliant Indrasarowar locals are hit by Covid-19, but they are hopeful of revival soon","Wednesday, August 19, 2020","Krishna Bahadur Shrestha of Markhu, Kulekhani in Makawanpur, owns a ‘hotel’ on the bank of Indrasarowar, an artificial lake made to collect water for Kulekhani Hydropower Project. Shrestha, 65, claims to be the only living witness of the transformation of a residential area into the lake in the mid- and late 1970s.
Shrestha’s hotel can house around 100 people at once but is totally empty for the past five months since the country went on lockdown to control coronavirus epidemic in the country. There are around a dozen other hotels waiting for their guests, but they are not certain how long the will go.
Besides hoteliers like Shrestha in Markhu who have been waiting for tourists, domestic and international. The Covid-19 crisis has severely hit their livelihood. Nevertheless, the locals are proud of the place and hope to get more visitors once the daily life returns to normalcy after the pandemic.
History of the place
“King Birendra was interested in generating electricity in Kulekhani. Hence, the government brought together seven rivers here,” Shrestha says, “Similarly, the river flowing from Phakhel has been blocked and the water is collected here through a tunnel.”
Around 1,000 families were displaced during the construction of the lake. Of course, the government gave them some compensation, but that was not enough for them to find a new residence and make a living at the same time.
However, after around 10 years of the construction, the government opened the lake for fishing after establishing a Fish Development Centre in Markhu. The government itself trained the locals for fishing. Many locals found a new source of employment and income.
In 1992, the locals established an association to promote fishing as entrepreneurship. Currently, 685 families are associated with this organisation. Shrestha says there was the monopoly of a handful of people before the association was established. “But, currently, the lake has become public property.”
There are four organisations of the locals actively involved in business based on the lake. Two of them are cooperatives, one the business association that Shrestha is a part of, and the last one is a union of locals operating boats in the lake.
Indrasarowar rural municipality-1 ward chairman Jaman Singh Waiba, who also led the Fish Entrepreneurs’ Association once, says that those who have been displaced by the construction of the lake but are not affiliated to the associations will be traced and included soon.
Attractions
One of the rivers that falls into the lake is called Thado Khola (literally, vertical stream). This river also has a beautiful waterfall at a distance of about 2 kilometres from the lake. It is called Thado Khola Jharana (or, vertical stream waterfall). Until a few years ago, many people did not know there was a waterfall. The locals would also go there only during the dry season occasionally because the way leading to this place was a bit difficult. However, the provincial government and Nepal Tourism Board recently made a trail to go to this place, with resting places in an interval of every 200-300 metres.
The waterfall is just two kilometres away from the lake, but it takes one and a half hours for city-dwellers to reach there. Nonetheless, the waterfall had already become a destination for tourists before the lockdown.
After boating along a three-kilometre stretch in the lake, people can also visit the origin of Thado Khola.
Mounds between two ends of the lake have also added attraction to the place. Perhaps there are many mounds, the locals still call this place a ‘stream’, not ‘a lake’.
Fishing is another attraction. The locals produce 30 to 25 tons of fish every year. Even if they sell fish at an average rate of Rs 300 per kg, their annual turnover exceeds Rs 10 million.
One of the arrangements made by Indrasarowar Fish Producers Association is definitely enlightening for all. That is to say, they set nets in the lake in the evening and collect fish in the morning. The fish are distributed equally among all local hotels. From this, all the entrepreneurs, big and small, have prospered equally. Around 20 to 50 kg of fish is extracted daily; those fish have not been wasted yet.
The fish-based enterprise has provided livelihood to around 1,000 families in the area. Besides, every member of the cooperatives earns Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 a year as the shared profit of the business. The locals had initially invested Rs 5,000 to Rs 40,000 for the share of the associations
However, the locals have not been able to earn as much as expected from the lake. The locals have been barred from giving ‘artificial’ feed to the fish whereas the price of fish is also comparatively low. A kilogram of fish here costs only Rs 325, much less than the price in Terai.
Despite such challenges, the locals were sustaining their life thanks to the lake. However, the Covid-19 crisis has hit them hard.
Nevertheless, some locals have also hoped that the crisis could be an opportunity. They think many young people who have returned home from their foreign jobs after being hit by the crisis and those losing their jobs in Nepal can also learn a lot from Indrasarowar.
Once the movement is eased, why do not you try visiting the place? Even if you are not interested in learning, Markhu, Indrasarowar could give you a different taste of fish for your tongue and a different view for your eyes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tourism-reliant-indrasarowar-locals-are-hit-by-covid-19-but-they-are-hopeful-of-revival-soon.html,travel
"Two cyclists’ lockdown escapade to Tamang Gaun, Jhor Mahankal (Part I)","Monday, August 10, 2020","“I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees”—Henry David Thoreau
Staying away from friends, ‘social’ distancing and no hanging around town for some time seemed like a hiatus, if not a long school vacation like in old days—nothing much to fret over. It did not after the lockdown crossed a wearisome two months.
Shayeet, my young companion next house, seemed on the verge of breaking.  I did not fare any better, stuck to my home, stultified, drained off all motivation, and creativity. My mind seemed to fail to get involved—to simply put it—bored out of my brains. My mountain bike languished in a corner untouched and undusted as my rides had come to a grinding halt. I was dying for a ride and that deep lungful of long-overdue fresh country air.
The ride
I called and asked Shayeet about doing a ride. He seemed in an all-mighty hurry to unwind himself. It was our calling, and we did not want to miss out on it. After toying with the idea, we finally decided, it was time we were connected with the backwoods—playing by safety measures, of course. We carried our lunch and water and to say the least, made up our minds to avoid ‘mortals,’ like the plague.
I live around Tokha area . . . been there for four years. Away from the city hubbub and the bottlenecks, I have come to like the place. The thing I hold in high regard about the locale is the neck of woods, which offer at spitting distances many tracks, both paved and dirt that lead to the countryside and the verdant hills.
What could I wish more—as I happen to be an avid mountain biker? And, the hills afford pretty challenging climbs and a load of single tracks into the bargain.

Weekend jaunts
The weekend rides are spoilt for choice as there are locations you can ride to by the bucketful.  If you get tired doing a route, you can switch to the next, or do the same, the other way round—that sure adds a whole new ball game to it. The closest from my house are, Jhor and Sangla, a little away from the ancient town of Tokha and a well-known shrine called Chandeswori, one of the Shakti Peeths.
If you fancy it, you can hit a steep climb next to the shrine, which heads towards a wooded hill with scarce habitation. The dirt road converges on a paved road. The left goes to Dandagaun, another sylvan uphill to the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park while the right bend takes you to the town of Budanilakantha, and the famous Hindu deity Vishnu, reclining under the hood of Shesh Naag (a thousand-headed reptile god from Hindu mythology) in a small pool.
Off to the hills
We rode that particular day to a new spot—purely a happenchance. Shayeet, my young partner, and I were riding to Jhor, planning to return via Sangla, a good 15-km round trip.
Suddenly, a little before Jhor past a fork that went to a wooded hill north, I called out to him if he would like to try a new place. Yes—came a pat reply. We double-backed and took the turn-off.  I had been on that track before, but least thought I would be doing it that day. I had previously given up on it when I was halfway up. Every time I spun by to Jhor, I instinctively looked up at the wooded hill with a tiny habitation.
Not to worry, I will do it someday for sure, I promised myself. That was eight years ago. And the only reason then for giving up was the impossible incline—way too steep for my earlier 9-speed GT bike.

Tokha
From our residence at Milan Tole (street), we pedalled right through the ancient Newar town of Tokha. Once an independent kingdom called Jaipur (later named Laxmipur), its history dated back to the Lichhavi era (c. 450-c. 750 CE). With time, rapid urbanisation transformed the town—old time-honoured heritage replaced by the so-called “modern” trappings.
Curiously, the town has not been able to shake off one of the last vestiges of the olden times, though—production of chaku (molasses) to this day. If you happen to take a stroll across the back alleys of Tokha, you cannot mistake the distinct robust aroma of molasses invading your olfactory senses.
Amusingly, you can even follow your nose down to a nearby factory. I did when first I visited the town to buy some chaku my wife asked to bring for Yomari Punhe. Tokha, or ‘tu’ ‘khya’ in Newari, translates to sugarcane field or ground, which the town once boasted in abundance. Chaku those days was produced from sugarcane juice; jaggery is used today, instead.
Off to Jhor
As we headed towards Jhor, the road appeared deserted and leaving out a couple of passing motorbikes, a few men and women with their masks on hung around their houses. Kids nearby seemed engaged in playing rough and tumble. The road was conspicuous by shuttered shops. Somehow, the vacated scenes appeared as it were from a sleazy Bollywood horror movie. And, we must have been portrayed as the baddies, all swathed in our MTB gear, helmets, and buffs that covered more than half our face.
“Uncle, if Kathmandu remained like this, it would be heaven on earth, no?” Shayeet said and fell into a full-blown guffaw. Nothing more than a pipe dream, I thought and smiled to myself. It would be “back to Mangalman” (Nepali jargon meaning ‘back to square one’) after the lockdown. Shayeet looked relieved, and tickled pink—seemingly a sudden torrent of water had burst out a sluicegate thrown wide open.
My Trek 10-speed Fuel-8 dual-suspension proved much better on the steep incline.  R and D today has indeed done wonders in churning out modern bikes with cutting-edge technology. You can get a branded mountain bike from an entry-level, Rs 65,000 to a high-end for an over the odds, Rs 300,000 or above. Shayeet too had a Trek, hardtail 29er—great for uphill.
It turned out, previously a dirt track, the stiff uphill was paved. The concrete was used on the gradient instead of asphalt so it worked better against wear and tear. Although far easier than before, some places remained near vertical.

Clusters of houses with intermittent empty plots growing vegetables and corn marked the roadsides. Some even had small patches of rice fields. As we pedalled up, the south afforded a better view of Tokha town and the urban sprawl further. Some 15 years back, save for a scattering of houses, Tokha’s fertile fields during the monsoon rolled out green stalks of rice cascading down as far as you could see. And, lush trees and shrubbery dotted the expanses creating an idyllic pastoral setting.
With the inroads of urbanisation, gone are those glorious days of natural splendor. Houses upon houses pepper the once open lush landscape; brick and concrete seem to have gobbled up the past verdure.
Up on the hill
Save for a handful, most teahouses and shops were boarded up; did not matter to us as we had no mind to drop by any. The climb got steeper and harder as we struggled on our “granny-gear.”“Jai Gadhi Mai,” I cried out loud (a call to the gods; people often do that, any god, to chin themselves up) and bore down on my pedals—real hard.
It seemed to work a little but soon proved too punishing, though, and before long I was at the end of my rope. Resignedly, I dismounted and pushed my bike up the incline; Shayeet did much better.
After a half-hour, the brow of the hill seemed to draw closer as houses appeared. Shortly, we were at Tamang Gaun. An enormous chaanp tree (Michelia champaca, more commonly Magnolia Champaca) with its extended branches and foliage stood tall on high ground by the roadside. Said to be more than six generations old, the village later was also referred to as Chapa Bot (tree), named after the ancient tree.
Its gnarled trunk and furrowed bark seemed to bear witness to its hoary age—its girth at one metre from the base measuring close to 10 ft. Shedding light on the early history of the tree, Kanchha Tamang, a 77-year-old village elder from Chapa Bot, said, “My great grandfather used to tell us, the chaanp tree stood there in his great grandfather’s times, too, when the entire Tamang Gaun hill was nothing short of a thick impenetrable jungle.”

The hillside overlooked the east to the densely forested ridge of the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park and the south commanded a smog-washed view of the sprawling Kathmandu valley. The northwest towered with the massive height of lush Shivapuri hill studded with cone-shaped pine trees—picture-perfect, indeed. The southwest looked over the Jhor town.
A little above, amidst a wooded hill, I spotted a pagoda-shaped structure that strangely appeared as the only sign of habitation, standing aloof, almost forbidding. “That’s Chihaan Danda (cemetery hill). It’s a crematory,” informed Kanchha Tamang. “All the deceased from Tamang Gaun is cremated there.”
“Recently, right next to the crematorium, two devout lamas went into a three-month-long meditation retreat,” he further added. He also revealed that in the olden times those who died of smallpox were first buried there, then exhumed after a week or so to be cremated again.
The Tamang village seemed sparsely inhabited with each house bearing plots of cultivated land that split into narrow terraces dropping down to the foothills—a small village, tiny holdings. With monsoon around the corner, knee-high corn stalks and green vegetables seemed to paint the hillside a verdant green.
But, the boom in real estate on the outskirts of Kathmandu valley did not seem to spare even the lush hills. I could make out the hideous tell-tale marks of land-plotting in Tamang Gaun, too.
As we stopped to sip a little water, recover our heavy breathing and soak in the rural landscape, we saw a few young lads hanging around a clearing before a bunch of houses on the hillside. None seem to wear a mask in the village. We had our buff on to cover almost half the face and still kept a distance as we struck up a conversation.
“Hello, guys, what must-see places are around here?” I asked one of the boys. “Well, for a start, you will want to look at a beautiful idol of Buddha right behind that Pipal (Ficus religiosa) in a small glass enclosure,” one of the fellows said, pointing towards it.

“Next, you can visit the Mahankal Devi temple. And if you go a little further up the hill, you will find the Jaleshwor Mahadev, close to the Shivapuri forest,” he seemed to eye our bikes longingly as he answered.” “Uncle, how much does a bike like yours cost?” another asked.
That is but clock-work, every time we are in the country. To his disbelief, I told him the price crossed one lakh rupees. We rested a bit, had a little chinwag with the boys and then hit the dirt road that followed a steep incline. “Darn it, we got to climb again,” I bemoaned out loud. Shayeet was already way up.

The houses thinned out as we slogged it up past a Stupa, white as snow. The letters in gold in the Tibetan Pinyin characters: ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པ་དྨེ་ཧཱུྃ (Om Mani Padme Hum) stood distinct on it. The dense Shivapuri forest seemed to get closer and pronounced. In something like 20 minutes, we spotted a copse of trees, surrounded by shrubs. A closer look showed a shrine on slightly high ground next to the road. A sign read, Mahankal Devi Temple.

7 places you should visit in Kathmandu,"Monday, July 27, 2020","If you are in Kathmandu, no matter for work or travel, going around the city is a must. Kathmandu city has become the cauldron where people from across the country have travelled and settled in. Moreover, the centuries-old historical and cultural imprint in the city makes it a perfect place for a day out. Being in place means to experience that place. Here are some of the must-visit places to experience the city.

At the top of a hill, Swayambhunath Stupa stands tall as one of the ancient architectures and holy places in Kathmandu. To reach the top, you have to climb the stairs, which leads you to the platform with the main stupa, some shrines, and other temples. It is believed that they were built during the Lichhavi period (fifth-eighth century). The main stupa, also known as the monkey temple, is an architectural marvel with a white dome and a tower-like structure with Budhha’s eyes painted on it. This place is most admired for the panoramic view of the city, on all sides.

Another famous Buddist pilgrimage in Kathmandu is Bouddhanath Stupa. It is one of the largest and holiest sites with equal architectural importance in the community. Buddhist devotees throng the place in abundance. However, it is equally famous among the youth for the ambience and the food. It is located on the northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu. Its main stupa is closely similar to that of Swayambhunath but has an outstretched, layered compound where people pay their homage.

Pashupatinath Temple is one of the most important heritage sites in Nepal and the most important place for Hindus of the country. It is the home to different forms of Lord Shiva along with other Hindu gods and goddesses worshipped in the religion. The main temple has a pagoda-style roof and has exquisite wood carvings on its sides making it an architectural masterpiece. The daily evening rituals and Hindu religious festivals attract a lot of people here every time.

At the heart of the city, Kathmandu Durbar Square is the most common and famous place people visit. The Durbar Square area has two sub-areas; one with other famous temples and landmarks including Kumari Ghar, Jagannath Temple, Kasthamandap, Shiva-Parbati Temple, Big Bell, Dabali, etc., all of which have great historical, cultural and architectural importance. The second area is the palace area with museums and courtyards including Nasal Chowk, Sundari Chowk, and Mul Chowk. It is said that the then King Prithvi Narayan Shah built the palace in 1770 and used it to rule over the kingdom during his reign. The place is filled with a vibrant crowd and there is a lot to explore.

Established as a tourist hub in Kathmandu, Thamel is another of those must-visit places in Kathmandu. The place has been developed to cater to the international crowd with its shops, cafes, clubs, art galleries, and other activities fit for the tourists. It is also the hub to get the best cultural and traditional souvenirs including thangka and singing bowls as well as the wide variety of food and cuisines. You can also visit the Garden of Dreams at the eastern end of Thamel and enjoy the serene and beautiful spread of flora inside.

On the eastern side of Thamel, there lies the then royal palace of monarchs in Kathmandu. Narayanhiti Palace, which was the royal residence built by King Mahendra in 1963, was reestablished as a museum in 2009, years after the Royal Massacre occurred (in 2001). It is now open to the public where one can see and experience the life and history of the royal family of Nepal.

On the western side of Kathmandu is one of the popular destinations, White Monastery, also known as Seto Gumba or Druk Amitabh Mountain. This Buddhist monastery is a religious site and is home to the rich Tibetan culture and architecture. The ambience of this place attracts many whereas it also allows one to enjoy the scenic view of Kathmandu and the panoramic view of the mountain ranges. It is also a great place to enjoy sunrises and sunsets.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/places-you-should-visit-in-kathmandu.html,travel
An odyssey to a hallowed wilderness: Surma Sarovar Yatra (Final Part),"Tuesday, June 30, 2020","(Read Part I and Part II)
As the trio–Shishir, Bijay and Amul–ploughed on, the highlands with lush meadows, blossoming flowers, and foliage seemingly appeared endless. Shishir guessed at the many species to be the invasive alien species.  Nepal’s eastern and western highlands abound in those species.
Bountiful nature
Nature knows no boundary. Apart from almost 135 species of flowering plants, Bajhang’s highland pastures hold a horde of herbs exceeding 200 numbers, with several endemic ones.
The fauna includes rare but endangered mammals such as red panda, musk deer, black bear, clouded leopard, and wolf, to name a few. Recent years, however, saw a rise in massive poaching, further threatening those species, including rare birds like danphe (lophophorus), impeyan monal, and pheasant. Sadly, barking deer (ratuwa) has completely vanished from the Bajhang hills, said a local.

Rocky terrain
After the turfy moors, the landscape switched to jagged granite cliffs shooting straight up into the skies as it were, floating above clouds. The foot-trail cut straight across, the path strewn with rocks and boulders. Suddenly, Shishir caught sight of a Himalayan blue poppy sticking out a rock face. He could not help taking a photograph. “Wow, it just beats me, how lovely flowers like these survive such a harsh environment,” he vociferated loudly to his mates.
As they headed towards the cliff, they spotted people descending. It turned out they were local pilgrims retracing to the village after having paid their homage to Surma Sarovar, carrying with them the holy water from the sacred pond. Curious, an elderly guy stopped to exchange a few words with them.  “How far is the Sarovar from here,” Amul asked the guy. That seemed to amuse him as he informed them they still had halfway to go. That made Amul look fazed.

Two minds
What a group of local devotees next told them appeared a little unsettling. Going by local religious norms, the pilgrims had to make it to Surma Sarovar latest by the morning of Janai Purné. None were supposed to visit after that for such visits were considered a sacrilege. Since they had missed out on that auspicious day, the group suggested there was no justification for going to the holy pond. That put the trio ill at ease.

As they held back, still in two minds, another bunch of devotees approached. As words exchanged, Shishir put up the issue with them. “We understand your dilemma, but since you have made it this far and as you are guests, you could still complete your journey. There is no harm in that,’’ said an elderly guy from the group.

Relieved, the trio ploughed on carefully avoiding the jagged steps as one false move and the razor-edged rocks could rip open a nasty gash on their naked feet. The elevation made each footfall torture gasping for every shred of oxygen as they further gained altitude.
As they made the punishing progress, they ran into another bunch of devotees on their way back home, who seemed to wind down on a rocky platform, their cane sticks resting beside them. They looked tired but determined. Suddenly, one of the fellows blew into a conch-shell, and the sound lifted into the stratosphere to rebound back soon. They rose to their feet to descend, followed by the rallying call—Cha ha, Cha, ha (chin up, chin up, guys).

High passes
Next came the passes. First, it was Nachani Pass at 4,560 m. The trail seemed treacherous as they had to slither down on their haunches on the slope.  One false move could spell disaster. They made it through, though, without any untoward incident. Although a little tough on Amul, he too passed muster.

The site held a shrine—rocks piled in a three-dimensional, five-tier, almost pyramid-shaped form. The structure housed different deities and a large bell. Shishir wondered at the presence of the shrine in the middle of nowhere in a moraine-like landscape bounded by craggy mountains.
After puja, the trio headed further north and by noon arrived at another formidable pass called Jaljala at 4,590 m, looking ominous in that rocky inhospitable badlands. They took a brief respite and munched on chiura, Wai Wai noodles, and dalmoth. The elevation seemed to take its toll as the breathing grew difficult, and every step a gasp for air.

The city-slickers seemed just not cut out for the terrain, particularly Amul. Their progress was reduced to virtually a crawl as the trail got harder and gnarlier, what with the thin level of oxygen, which made it almost impossible to breathe.  “Guys, there is one more pass called Chandé Shikhar to go, at 4,890 m (16,338.58268 ft), a little above the snowline, the highest we’ll have done in this trek,” announced Shishir. Amul looked the most pitiable. He had never in his life attempted that kind of altitude. “This is going to be my toughest and the highest trek ever,” Amul exhaled loudly as he blurted out aloud.

From the height, Shishir’s eyes suddenly caught a glimpse of a pond way below, the size of Tau Daha in Kathmandu amidst tall mountains, some snow-capped at the backdrop. Must be the Sarovar, he thought. “Guys, I think we’ll probably make it by nightfall,” he called out to the duo. “There, below, I can see it,” he said, pointing a finger.

The assault began for the final pass, Chandé Shikhar. He later learned the Surma Sarovar festival was celebrated with equal pomp and festivity by the locals of Darchula on the same occasion of Janai Purne.
The hallowed pond on that day was crawling with devotees from the two districts. The Sarovar served as a borderline separating Bajhang and Darchula. Shishir later learned the rituals performed by the villagers of Darchula differed from that of Bajhang.

The track at the Pass looked scary, buried in snow, hardly a foot apart, and slippery. Each step called for extreme caution. If the left dropped hundreds of feet below on one side, the other fell into a formidable crevasse.  “Man, it’s scary,’’ called out Amul as he appeared awkward doing a tightrope walking, his right hand holding a staff.
Barely had they overcome the hurdle than another appeared, which looked nothing short of death-defying to Amul. They had to haul themselves up a steep rock face with the aid of an iron chain fixed to the wall with sheer drops on one side. Shishir figured the cliff had a recent landslip, and the villagers had secured the chains. “A lifetime adventure of my life,’’ hollered out Amul as he heaved himself over the crag.

The trio pushed on with frequent stops for a breather. The landscape continued to be barren and rocky with sparse patches of grassland. Shadows lengthened, and the pale cloud-washed Sun gradually began dipping on the western horizon. The darkness seemed to creep in upon them as it struck six.
Shishir wanted to make it to the Sarovar, but soon his spirits were dampened as a mizzle began, shortly followed by low clouds and squalls of rain. The trio quietly kept walking through the rain, though, wishing to reach their destination. Soon, they had to use flashlights to find their way through the permeating and clinging shroud of blackness.
By 8 pm, they were at the end of their rope and finally decided to camp for the night. The rain continued as they pitched the tent. A thick fog then set in. Shishir had a strong feeling they were not very far away from the Sarovar, maybe just a spitting distance, but he could not confirm his intuition as pitch darkness stood in the way.  Done in and sleepy, they retired early after a quick supper.
Day four: Destination
The threesome got up early the next day. Every one seemed in high spirits with the comforting feeling they were almost at their yatra’s (journey’s) end. It turned out, the Sarovar was not visible from the camp as Shishir thought, but his hunch told him, it was close. The entire wilderness appeared with no life around.
Following their last meeting with the local devotees, the trail remained deserted all the way. Later after a brief discussion, they decided on leaving the tent and gear at the spot for the final leg to Surma Sarovar. Nothing to fret about their gear stolen as the wilderness stood out for miles with no sign of any life.
The rain stopped during the night, but the sunless sky was overcast with heavy clouds. As the entire locale was a rocky section, the trail seemed to peter out after some time. As luck would have it, they followed the telltale clues—filth—cigarette stubs, chocolate wrappers, empty tobacco sachets, and the like that was sure to lead them to the Sarovar. And it did.
After something like 35 minutes, they finally arrived at Surma Sarovar. Amul looked the most relieved and the happiest. Next to the pond stood the Surma Mai shrine, a pyramidal stack of stone-slabs similar to the one at Nachani Pass, all decked out with scads of red and saffron-coloured Vedic Bhagwa Dhwajas (Hindu Sanatan Dharma religious flags).

Customarily, those flags flown at most of our temples are single pennon. Strangely, the Surma people had devised their own with double pennons similar to our national flag. It is also said Nepal’s national flag, bearing Hindu symbols of Chandra Banshi (Moon dynasty) and Surya Banshi (Sun dynasty), was inspired by the Vedic Sanatan flag.  Shishir could make out the white-bordered flag carried the symbols of a Sun, a crescent Moon, a trident, and others. An elated Amul, went on to fly the flag at the edge of the pond for a photoshoot.


As Shishir wound up his story, I could not help asking him a question that kept squirming like an angleworm in my mind right from the opening narration of the story.

“It beats me, how you guys did such rugged heights on bare feet. I can’t even imagine doing one single kilometre on naked feet, let alone a trek. Didn’t your pads hurt?” Shishir just smiled back.

An odyssey to a hallowed wilderness: Surma Sarovar Yatra (Part II),"Sunday, June 21, 2020","(Read Part I)
The next day, it was already sundown when the main priest was done with the puja ceremony.  Thunder sounded, and a slight drizzle began. At long notes of a bevy of conch-shells, the journey began. As the mass of devotees led by the main priest set off amidst a thunderous cacophony, the sound seemed to travel miles across the small village, mysteriously bouncing off the hills.
Chanting women stood by and bid farewell to their menfolk. “Time to join in,” called out Shishir to his partners, and they soon dissipated in the parading horde. For a casual city-slicker from Kathmandu, if he happened to be there, the entire sight before him of people heading into the rain with naked feet on that darkened hill would appear nothing short of an eye-deceiving spectacle.
But it was real, true-to-life, and no two ways about it—heritage passed onto the rural folks from their forefathers for ages.
To the darkened hills
The epic walk kicked off led by the Mula (chief priest) with little regard to dark trails and unrelenting rain; pilgrims brought up the rear. The trail climbed wounding uphill. Amul, a tenderfoot, seemed to flounder on the wet, narrow, and slippery path for a firm foothold groping for handholds.

Shishir and Bijay seemed to take it in stride, though. Bijaya had travelled to almost all the districts in the far-west during his tenure at his respective workplaces and done a fair share of trekking to remote places. Shishir soon got the message; they were no match for the locals who seemed effortless and nimble on the steep climb. The trio heaved themselves up the narrow winding path muddy and slippery with slime.
Soon a colony of leeches began their assault gorging on their blood. The overgrown grass at most places made it difficult to walk in the beam of their flashlights. Often, they lost footing, barely escaping a fall. They clung onto the track, stoically accepting the challenge. As the caravan advanced, the lights from the village gradually receded into tiny specks.
The sight of popping flashlights inching up on the darkened hill seemingly appeared in perfect symmetry, evoking an uncanny air of mystique. Next, as the almost 300-strong long file of pilgrims negotiated the treacherous muddy trail up and down, they broke into a rallying cry of “cha ha, cha ha”—followed by the shrill horn of conch-shells, sounding eerie in the dead of night.  And the shrill loud note tore through the stillness of the night. Cha ha, Cha ha.
The moving column of devotees, Shishir learned, would continue throughout the night. Such chivalry was not the trio’s forte. Little before midnight, Shishir and Bijay decided to camp for the night. Midnight struck, by the time they found a flat surface to pitch the tent.
After a hectic, disorganised, and confusing fumbling in the dark with rain pouring in, they finally managed to put up the tent at 3,190 m for the bivouac. Next, it was time for a much-needed food to ease their groaning stomach. They huddled together inside the tent to eat. They wolfed down lachhedar paratha (the kind you get in department stores of late) straight off the packet accompanied by shelf-stable chutney and crawled into their sleeping bags—cold and wet.
Despite the pitter-patter of the rain against the roof of the tent, there was no mistaking the faint sound of the marching feet punctuated by the trailing note of the conch-shell and the rallying cries. The rain continued to lash down relentlessly.
Day II
The last night’s gruelling climb, on their first leg of Surma Sarovar Yatra, seemed to tell on the threesome–Shishir, Bijay, and Amul–as they slept late that morning.  By the time they awakened, it was eight. The rain stopped some time at night. The sun was up, and crisp weather with a hint of nip greeted them as they shuffled out their tent.

After a hurried dismantling of their tent and tucking away some leftovers of the previous night, they hit the trail.  Soon, they caught up on higher elevation, and by the time they climbed to 3,500 m, the trees seemed to recede gradually replaced by grass and shrubland.  As the trail led uphill, they wove their way in and out almost shoulder-high wild flowering plants.

Dharmashala
The morning vista with the rolling hills punctuated by towering mountains every way you looked and a penetrating blue sky skirted by fleecy cumulus white clouds was a soothing sight for both eyes and mind. The weather in the sub-alpine altitude can, mind you, take a mood swing in no time.
Next, they slogged it up a grassy knoll with a shelter built with stones and corrugated tin sheets for the roof, at 3,500 m. It was called Lotani Dharmashala, which served as a resting place for the pilgrims. They rested a bit and then resumed their climb, getting higher and higher. At about noon, they stopped, for lunch—chiura (beaten rice), dalmoth (dry snack), and Wai Wai noodles, all shifted around.

With the rise in elevation, Amul seemed to shuffle on all fours looking weary and fairly blown.  “Gosh, it’s getting harder every minute. This must be the toughest trek of my life,” Amul bemoaned; his face read like an open book. Shishir and Bijay just smiled.
Setback
After something like three-and-a-half hours, they progressed to another Dharmashala, elevation: 4,200 m, time: 4 pm. Not a soul around. Even the last of the villagers had left them way behind the earlier day. The weather then, without so much as a warning, took a sudden shift.
Visibility dropped to near-zero on the crest of the hill as a dense hazy-grey fog rolled in. Shortly, a thin film of mist descended, which brought a palpable chill to the weather. They stopped to rest and recover their breath. It turned out, Bijay had a problem, a headache, but thankfully no hint of nausea. Not to be taken lightly, though, Shishir thought.
Must be the altitude, but fearing a possible symptom of AMS, Shishir decided to call it a day and camp there for the night. He asked Bijay to take plenty of water suspecting a case of dehydration. Lo and behold, it turns out they had run out of water.
The earlier Dharmashala had a water faucet next to it. Shishir looked around, but there was no sign of a tap. Just then, a soft rumble sounded, from the leaden grey sky, of impending rain, and before long Shishir felt a few drops on his cheeks. Got to do something about the water, he mused. It would be a blessing in disguise if it rained.

Hurriedly, Shishir dug a shallow pit next to the tent and spread out a plastic sheet in the hollow. He then weighed it down at the edges with rocks to prevent being blown away by the wind. The light pitter-patter turned into a slight drizzle when he was done. He retired to the tent satisfied.
Day Three: Nature’s bounty
The following day, the sunlit morning looked and felt rejuvenating. The sun shone brightly, and the weather was clear.  Bijay appeared refreshed and cheerful, the next best thing. “Thanks to Surma Mai, I feel great today,” he said, and to Shishir’s great relief, he even went on to enthuse about the weather. And further to his delight, the hollow pit yielded about three liters of rainwater, more or less, to last the day.

With every half-hour, the landscape seemed to take a dramatic shift. Way below a ridge, hovering clouds, intertwined with the hills that rolled out as far as the eyes travelled.  After a lush mix of deciduous and coniferous flora below the 4,000-m mark, they were now weaving their path across a vast green moor with wildflowers in full bloom, a riot of pink and golden yellow against verdant wild grass, knee-high in some places.

Alpine steppe
The tree-less terrain indicated, they were on the alpine steppe, a high altitude natural moorland, which is a part of Montane grassland and shrubland biome. The alpine zone begins above the tree-line and below the snowline in between 3,500 and 4,200 metres.

Alpine steppes found throughout the world, and the Himalayan region of Nepal among others in Asia, are considered unique ecosystems. They occur in both east and west Nepal after 3,500 m and above. Shishir learned later the grassland they treaded on happened to be the Yarsagumba (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) grounds.

Yarsaland
The entire Surma and surrounding villages, during harvest time, last of May through the end of June, are virtually emptied off people—men, women, boys, and even girls, leaving the entire locales to appear like ghost towns.  Youngsters bunk school to scale formidable heights to pick the caterpillar fungus also dubbed the ‘biological gold.’

For everyone on the mass exodus to collect yarsagumba, it is like a pay-off period—windfall money that met their year’s expenses plus perks. “Young boys and girls from the village never ask their parents for pocket money all around the year. They make as much as three to seven lakh rupees every harvest time,” a local fellow revealed.
“Wow—that sounds great! Maybe we should also give it a try the forthcoming season,” quipped Shishir. The fellow sniggered in return, mightily amused. “Not by a long shot. It’s no picnic and is fraught with untold grave danger and perils. I wouldn’t advise it, not on your life,” he voiced. Shishir just smiled in return.
Biodiversity
The moorland with bracken and heather seemed never to end as they gained ground. Along with grass, the terrain seemed carpeted by a panoply of blooming flowers adding a romantic and idyllic setting found in postcard pictures.

The meadows of west highlands of Nepal in spring and pre-monsoon times turn into a carpet of flowers that include, Himalayan thimbleweed, Colorado columbine, alpine forget-me-not, primulas, buttercups, wild geraniums, Himalayan blue poppy, and many more.

An odyssey to a hallowed wilderness: Surma Sarovar Yatra (Part I),"Sunday, June 7, 2020","Can you imagine trekking to a remote destination in the rugged hills to an elevation of 14,157 feet (4,315 m), crossing a snow-laden pass en route at 16,043 ft (4,890 m)—and no kidding—on bare feet? I cannot—but some do.
I called an old friend, Shishir, to know, if he had set his sights on a trek shortly or done any recently. Despite several attempts, his cell phone answered ‘switched-off.’ I called another friend if he knew. My hunch came true. Indeed, he was away. Some two weeks later, I called again and finally got him.
It turned out he had gone to the far west to Bajhang to a highland called Surma Sarovar (4,315m). We fixed a day for a chat over tea. He gave me a brief rundown on his story and showed me a few photographs. Guess what! He had done another of his madcap escapade—on bare feet after Budhinanda Tal (read full story) trek in Bajura in 2018. The story completely bowled me over. I just could not wait to do the story.
Shishir Raj Joshi
Before going into the story, let’s get to know Shishir Raj Joshi, aka ‘Super Tramp,’ whom I have known for five years. He is commonly accepted, among our circle of friends, as a man of fewer words and his little peculiarities. He either listens mostly or answers your questions in just nods, grunts, and smiles, leaving you, at times, a tad fidgety.
When it comes to trekking, we expect basic amenities like eateries on the route to feed us, teahouses to replenish, and at the end of a weary day, a warm cozy bed a lodge offers to sleep like a log. That for 30-year-old Shishir is of little account, first comes his quest for ‘pukka’ adventure.
He is nuts about doing uncharted, untrodden, and untamed destinations, as isolated and wild as they can get, breaking away from established norms, rarely found in the books of conventional trekkers. Such wild wanderlusts include solo ventures into the bargain. And of all things, on bare feet! That’s what sets Shishir Raj Joshi apart.
Destination Chainpur
After weeklong planning, the big day came and Shishir was all set to go. His gear included a sleeping bag and camping mat with a selected few personal effects. For the Surma journey, Shishir had to take a bus to Chainpur (not to confuse with east Chainpur, Sankhuwasabha), the district headquarters of Bajhang, a weary 36 hours ride from Kathmandu. The bus left as scheduled at 2 pm.
After a little over 12 hours, the bus arrived at Kohalpur (near Nepalgunj) in the wee hours the next day and headed due west to Attariya. Shishir was used to travelling by bus as all his treks preceded them. He knew well, in absence of hitches en route, buses arrived at their destinations as scheduled.
At 5:30 am, Shishir was rudely awakened by a sudden racket, as the bus stopped at the Attariya check post for a routine check. As it turned out, an altercation had broken out between the bus driver and a couple of policemen who had scrambled up the bus to carry out an inspection and found out most seats occupied rice-bags instead of commuters. And, that held the bus for close to three hours.
After Dipayal and Dandeldhura, the bus finally arrived at Chainpur, three hours behind schedule. The time was 11:30 at night. Shishir learned, to find a lodge, it took almost a half-hour walk into the town core from the bus stop. Chances were, most would be shuttered up at that hour.
Undecided and confused, he looked around to find someplace to shack up for the night. He found none. Desperate, he approached the helper boy from the bus and asked if he could spend the night on the bus he had come on since it was a long way to the town for a lodge.
Hard luck, the bus, he said, would not halt there for the night but leave for the garage. “But I’ve got a friend who has a shack not very far from here. It’s nothing much, but if it’s okay by you, I can take you there,” he offered. It turned out the shack was a shabby little shelter boarded up with corrugated tin sheets. Beggars are no choosers, he said to himself and spent the night there with the boy.
Chainpur, located at the confluence of Seti and Bauli Gaad rivers, a remote town in the far west, seemed to forge ahead to rapid urbanisation. Officially, it is called Jaya Prithvi, named after a past Bajhangi King. The dense town square appeared busy and bustling, as all manner of shops, scores of eateries, and as many guesthouses flanked the streets.
The Bajhang district, as it happens, is recalled for several notable things like the sacred pilgrimage of Khaptad Baba (also an awesome trekking destination),  Mount Saipal (7,619 m), part of the Great Himalayan Trail (GHT), ruins of olden forts and palaces of past kings, Bajhangi Rajas, the one of a kind local deuda song and dance that identifies far-west Nepal, production of handmade Nepali Lokta paper, yarchagumba, touted as the ‘biological gold, or the ‘Himalayan Viagra’—and Nepal’s sensational ace swimmer— Gaurika Singh (she hails from Bajhangi Royalty).

From Chainpur, Shishir had to catch a Bolero to Surma village as no buses shuttled on that route. While waiting for the jeep, he ran into two fellows, who were also going to Surma village. After a brief exchange of introductions and idle conversation, it turned out the duo, too, was headed for Surma Sarovar.
The guys happened to be cousins from Barda Ghat, Nawalparasi. The older guy, Bijay Adhikari, in his mid-thirties, a mechanical engineer, worked in Kathmandu. The younger, Amul Adhikari, only aged 21, was doing his Bachelor’s in Kathmandu.
Surma village
The 22-23km on the Bolero to Surma village (2,390 m) on the rutted dirt track, despite a bumpy, bone-shaking ride, rewarded with sweeping views of Nepal’s far-western country landscape with lush rice fields and hills dotted with greenery, blending well with idyllic pastoral settings.
Shishir had no idea his solo venture would end up teaming up with the two guys. It did following their arrival at Surma village.
Surma village looked like a small close-knit cluster of houses built end to end with walls done in stones and rooftops clad with slates. The narrow alleys that wound along the bazaar area, too, were laid out with flagstones. It was nearly dark when they arrived. Shortly, they learned the village had no guesthouses. They managed to get a room in a vacant house to bunk down courtesy of Ward chief, Buddhiman Bohara.
Surma Birijat Mela
The next morning the trio took a flying tour of the village predominated by ethnic Dhamis or Jhankris (shamans by profession), Rokayas or Rokkas (Khas community), and Boharas (both Brahmin and Kshatriya) and got a surprise to see the place crawling with people—milling around bare-footed.
They learned the hubbub was preparatory to Surma Birijat Mela, celebrated every other year (coinciding with an even-number) for a week with the onset of Janai Purne (the festival of the sacred thread wound around by Brahmins and Kshatriyas celebrated all over Nepal on a full moon day occurring in Shrawan or July/Aug).

Temporary shelters and lean-tos lined the streets peddling fruits, sweets to sundries. They happened to talk with a sweetshop owner who had come as far away as Mathura, India, to set up shop for the festival.
Local tradition decreed every villager or visitors from nearby villages attending Mela (festival), shed off shoes a week before, and also stayed off meat, garlic, and onion. Amusingly, those travelling to the village took their shoes off the moment they boarded off the vehicle.
It turned out the rules applied to guests from Kathmandu too. They hurriedly took their shoes off and shoved them into their backpack before walking to the nearby Surma Devi temple, the most venerated shrine for the people of Chainpur and neighbouring districts.
Devi Surma, going by myth, is believed to be one among the 16 daughters of Goddess Bhagawati. The shrine premises was, in like manner, overflowing with devotees, with women outstripping the men.
Shishir approached a local guy to dig out some info. “The women folks offer puja to Mai Surma Devi as a preliminary ritual for the Surma Sarovar journey. The pilgrimage only begins after this ritual is over.”
What the fellow said next struck as strange. “Womenfolk are barred from joining the epic walk. The ancient tradition allows only males. Women offer puja and prepare Prasad (devotional offering of food) for those males who go to Surma Sarovar.” That reminded Shishir of women denied entry to this day into Chisapani Gadi Fort built by Prithvi Narayan Shah in Makawanpur.
On the eve
Upon dusk, the puja ceremony seemed to commence in a furious festive frenzy at Surma Devi temple crammed with devotees amidst loud beat of dhimays (drums), snapping percussions, and the rising drone of chanting.  Most men flourished cane bamboos (nigalo in Nepali) locally called ‘bire lauro’ festooned with red cloth and wild grass on the tip. For the trio, it was an awesome sight and sound, near spine-tingling.

At sundown, men at the temple premises stewed milk in large iron karahis (black iron cauldron) to make khoya (evaporated milk solids) for the Prasad while women huddled up in groups chattering to each other.  The puja would continue all through the night and, so would cooking of Prasad for Ma Surma at Surma Sarovar.
Next, at midnight, menfolk broke into a rhythmic swaying, the Deuda dance, chorusing a local religious song.  At another corner, shamans gyrated to the tune of dhimay as others watched in awe the traditional healers in spiritual possession. Shishir, Bijay, and Amul had already waited one full day for the journey to Surma Sarovar to begin.

They learned, they could not proceed. None could until the puja ritual concluded, and the Mula, the main priest, took the first steps to signal the outset of the exodus to the holy pond of Surma Sarovar at sunset the next day. They retraced their steps back to retire for the night.

"Cycling from Bhim Dunga, Switzerland Park to Kalu Pandey Memorial Ground (Part II)","Friday, May 22, 2020","(Read the first part)
Despite the grand-sounding name, Switzerland Park in Dahachok hills failed to measure up to our expectations.  Shayeet and I did not in all seriousness relish the idea of turning once unsullied hillside into a picnic spot.
The gravel road after Switzerland Park looked graded, offering a smooth ride. We learned from the teashop owner work around the clock was carried out only a week ago for the Prime Minister’s visit to inaugurate Kalu Pandey Memorial Park.
As the hill rose straight up ahead, the left flank dropped to terraced fields and countryside. Far across, I could make out through haze and smog fuzzy glimpse of a string of cable-car towers that climbed to Chandragiri height. A cluster of houses squatted on the hillside that dropped to the town of Thankot.
Towards Kalu Pandey Memorial
As we pedalled uphill, the past endless steep climbs seemed to tell on my limbs. I fell way behind and seemed to struggle on my pedals. As I took a bend, I saw Shayeet off his bike, eyeing his rear bicycle wheel. As I caught up, it was as plain as day, his bike had a flat. Not to worry, though. To take on the matter, we were fully equipped.
For every mountain biker, the rule of thumb requires to pack, among others, a pump, patch kits, and a spare tube. We call it hard-nosed survival skills. We had everything stashed into our backpack, including a toolset and a first-aid kit. You never know when they might come in handy while you are riding the hills or some remote locales, or for that matter, take a fall and get hurt—if it comes to that.
As we were short on time, we skipped the patch-up work and just replaced the tube with a spare. It took us hardly 20 minutes to fix it. Shyaeet pumped the tyre up, and we were all set to spin again. “Come on, partner, let’s shake a leg, we haven’t got much time,” I called out as I straddled my bike.

Indra Daha

Little before Kalu Pandey Memorial Park, my eyes caught a turnoff. A sign read Indra Daha. We decided to have a look-see. The place had a small pond in the fore, while Shikhara and Pagoda style small temples flanked the front, which housed stone figures of Lord Indra, Indrayani, Shaligram, Bhairav, and Surya.
Amazing it may sound, the temple also held only stone carving in the whole of Nepal of an elephant (Indra’s vehicle), Airavata, with Indra and his wife, Indrayani (also Sachi Devi) on its back.
As I wondered what must have given the shrine its name, I spotted a man offering his prayers. I approached him. A large seven-headed stone-figure of Vasuki Nag, the King of serpents, seen invariably around Lord Shiva’s neck, stood over the pond with its hood fanned out.

The gentleman sounded all too happy to satisfy my curiosity. “Referring to holy scriptures of Vedic Puranas by Vyasa, the ancient scholar who penned the epic drama, Mahabharat,” he began, “Lord Devraj Indra, God of thunder, storm, and rains made Lady Ahalya, consort of Rig-Vedic sage Gautam Maharishi, the victim of his lust by deception using his celestial power to transmute himself as a clone of her husband.”
“Following this incident,” the man resumed, “when Gautam Rishi found out about it, enraged, he handed down a curse to Indra, which condemned him to lose his virility for good. He also cursed Ahalya to remain invisible for life, blending into the dust of the hermitage she lived in. Ahalya was eventually liberated from the curse when Lord Rama and Laxman, during their exile, happened to visit the hermitage and stepped inside.”
“Guilt and remorse led Indra to observe many years of hard penance and reclusion. After completing his profound atonement to rid himself of the spell, he took a cleansing dip in a pool and left for his abode in Heaven.”
“This pond happens to be the same where Lord Indra took a dip and thus came to be called, Indra Daha, and the shrine, Indrasthan. Every year on the day of Bhadra Shukla Purnima (full moon in Aug/Sept), a day after the celebration of Indra Jatra, at Basantpur, Kathmandu, a festival is held at this place, which draws thousands of devotees to Indra Daha to take a holy dip,” he finished.

Kalu Pandey Memorial
We thanked the man and huffed it up the last leg to Kalu Pandey Memorial. The park rested on a grassy clearing upon the brow of a hill. What caught my eyes first was the imposing life-size statue of Kaji Kalu Pandey done in glossy gold, in full regalia of a warrior.
Dressed in a long flowing white frock and a distinctive white cap, his right hand held a long scimitar, a khukuri, a signature weapon of the Gokhalis, lay stuck in a cummerbund, and a buckler shield slung by his left waist.
Kalu Pandey always stood out among others for his one-of-a-kind white rounded cap. Armed with flintlock muskets, the Shardul Jung Gulma, also popular as  Prithvi Narayan Shah’s Gurujyu’s Paltan, even today, is seen wearing an identical cap (in black) as they parade down Basantpur Square on the day of Ghatasthapana (onset of Dashain).
Next to the statue, a flagpole flew our national flag. A view tower pending finishing works stood behind the park. Further across, I noticed a telecom radio-repeater tower, which I learned associated with a tragic air-crash in 1999 when a Necon Air aircraft arriving from Pokhara hit the tower and crashed, killing all aboard.

Next on the park grounds, the remains of Kaji Kalu Pandey (said to be a severed head), slain in the battle of Kirtipur, lay in a three-tier burial platform clad in thin stone veneer texture.   An inscribed marble tablet stood close by on the turf.


History
Born as Banshidhar Pandey in 1770 BS, Kalu Pandey was considered a shrewd administrator and gallant warrior. For his resourcefulness and tact in warfare, Gorkha ruler Prithvi Narayan Shah appointed him his Chief Minister and also conferred upon him the title of Kaji.
The pages of history chronicle the sweeping victories made by King Prithvi Narayan Shah over petty states like Nuwakot, Belkot, Sirhanchok, Tadhi, and Naldhum, under Kalu Pandey’s command. Disaster, however, struck when the Gorkha ruler, in his consuming drive to annex the Valley of Nepal, namely Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhadgaun, made a hasty decision.
Premonition
For Prithvi Narayan Shah to wage war on Nepal Valley kingdoms, he had to overcome Kirtipur first, which stood as an invincible fortress. In his haste, he ordered Kalu Pandey to mount an assault on Kirtipur.
A sagacious commander, acting on a tip-off from his undercover agents about the three kingdoms having formed a powerful coalition of their armed forces to repel the Gorkhali attack, advised the King not to attack Kirtipur at the time.
The Gorkha ruler, despite Kalu Pandey’s pleas, however, remained adamant and unyielding. He seemed in an all-fired hurry to seize Kirtipur and advance to the Valley kingdoms.  The great warrior, it is said, had a hunch that the battle would result in his death. He even bade farewell to his wife with a sad heart and left his son with the King to be taken care of should something happen to him.
The Gorkhali soldiers under Kaji Kalu Pandey’s command, invaded Kirtipur in May 1757 during peak Dashain festival, advancing by way of Naikap. After wading through the Balkhu Khola (stream), the Gorkhalis met with stiff resistance at Tyanglaphant. Outnumbered, the invaders, however, stood no chance against the combined Newar forces of the Nepal Valley led by Kaji Danuvanta. They had to face a frustrating defeat and retreated—paying a heavy price, though.
The battle that lasted for five hours ended with the death of 400 Gorkhali braves—and the valiant Commander of the Gorkhali forces, Kalu Pandey, slain (Jestha 19, 1814 BS). Prithvi Narayan Shah, too, narrowly escaping death, fled incognito as a sadhu or ascetic to his fort in Nuwakot.
That was a momentous victory for the Newar kingdoms, including Kirtipur. After the retreat of Gorkhali forces, the combined militia of three kingdoms paraded the streets to mark their triumph. They went on to hang Kaji Kalu Pandey’s weapons for display on the walls of the Bagh Bhairav Temple in Kirtipur.
Manakamana Temple

We next stopped by a replica of Mankamana Temple, just 50 yards from the Park.  History pages record King Prithvi Narayan Shah built the temple in memory of his most cherished army commander, Kaji Kalu Pandey.
“The last wish of the great warrior at his dying moment, it is said, was to be buried at a vantage point, which commanded a view of both Gorkha and Manakamana Temple,” said an 86-year-old village elder, Jit Bahadur Magar, whom we met at the temple.
He further told me, the height we stood upon not only commanded a view of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur, but on a clear day also allowed visitors to catch a glimpse of Gorkha, Nuwakot, Dhading, and Rasuwa. As we prepared to leave, I looked towards the north-eastern skyline, if I could pick up the Himalayan ranges Dahachok hills boast.
But the blasted shimmering haze completely blanketed the northern skies. Locals claim some of the vantage grounds offer you to clap your eyes on a spectacular sight of the entire Himalayan shebang that includes Ganesh Himal, Jugal, Gaurishankar, Sumeru, Lakpa Dorje, Manasalu, the Mahalangur Range and the Annapurna Range including the iconic Machhapuchare. If weather, of course, permits.

Happier and wiser, we hit the road back home. I kept wondering at Dahachok’s immense diversity. It was not just another locale. Apart from offering a scenic getaway, the boondocks to reconnect with, it paraded a reputed pilgrimage, scriptures from middle ages, and chockful of history all thrown in.
Later, I also learned the foothills of Dahacok hills held ruins of ancient forts and scattered stone slabs in rice fields, which bore letters inscribed in Sanskrit Lichhavi script (400 to 750 CE). Maybe, Lichhavis once ruled there, I figured.
As we rolled down the road, in the orange glow of the setting sun, I caught a glimpse of the sprawling valley. I stopped and watched. “Man, isn’t it just amazing?” I said aloud. Small wonder, the Gorkha ruler was so beset with the vision of hoisting his victory banner over the tempting valley—I mused.

Cycling from Bhim Dunga via Switzerland Park to Kalu Pandey Memorial Ground (Part I),"Monday, May 11, 2020","Kathmandu offers every mountain biker bountiful to explore outdoors—intimate hills, lush woods, laidback countryside, a breath of fresh air, and by far, nature at its best. No sooner you are done with one fascinating jaunt than another awaits you. It’s all yours for the taking. All you got to do is make your mind up, prep up your bike, and hop onto your saddle.

The past two months of December 2019 and January 2020, with cold spells followed by dull overcast skies, erratic showers, and no sun for days, had dampened my mountain biking spirit close to naught.  The first week of February showed a little promise, though.
Warmer and sunny days nudged me awake to dust my mountain bike and muse over some locales to ride. It also seemed long-overdue to stretch out my slackened muscles. I had heard a lot about the Kalu Pandey Hills among bikers for the track’s challenging inclines. I asked my neighbourhood cycling partner, Shayeet, if he would be interested in riding to those hills. He jumped at the offer.
Off to the hills
On a weekday, we left for Kalu Pandey. The early morning sun seemed to promise crisp weather. “Great weather,” Shayeet remarked as we jumped on to our saddles.  We hit the Ring Road and headed for Sitapaila. Since I was a little confused about the route, I had called earlier an old pro-biker friend who had biked there several times. He suggested we took the Sitapaila—Ramkot route.

Oversight
After something like one-half kilometre westward after Sitapaila, it turned out, we had, unwittingly, taken a wrong turn at a fork. Instead of heading straight to Ramkot, we took the road on our right towards the Druk Amitabh Mountain Monastery, otherwise known as Seto Gumba (white monastery).
Without going uphill to the monastery, we headed further north to Ichangu Narayan. The paved road turned into a stiff climb and led towards wooded heights flanked by Nagarjun hills. Jamacho, with its dense, lush forest, towered high on our right. I still thought we were on the right track. We were not.
Not until we pedalled past the Ichangu Narayan Vishnu Temple and climbed a hill leaving behind a bazaar area and clusters of houses than I had the hunch that we had taken the wrong route. “Shayeet, we better ask some locals, or else we will get lost,” I called out.
We stopped by a house and approached a local guy. We had indeed taken a circuitous route. The guy told us we needed to climb the hill ahead and turn south towards Seto Gumba, then take the downhill dirt road to Ramkot. We had just done a steep climb, now another awaited. “Darn it,” Shayeet called out in frustration. Some 45 minutes later, we met a side track, one went down west, while the other headed east towards Seto Gumba.

We stopped by a teashop and asked the shop owner. “Head down along that wooded hill,” he pointed a finger a little to the south and said, “and just stick to the dirt road; that will take you straight off to Ramkot.  After that, there would be no mistaking the road to Kalu Pandey. Just ask around.”
Countryside
The height rolled out a view of Ramkot, a sprawling cluster of houses at the foothill. I could make out from the height the road that cut right across sprawling fields and the countryside from Sitapaila and could even locate the turnoff where we had screwed up.

The ridge we were on seemed to burst into colours as clumps of golden marigold dotted the hillside, lending a pleasant setting to the rural landscape. They could not be wild, could they, I asked myself? The locals around the place must be into marigold farming, I mused. On the other hand, haze and smog seemed to cloak the far-off suburbs like a veil—a depressing sight indeed.
Ramkot
The gravelly downhill section proved a real thrill as we coasted down the winding track, across quiet woods, with soaring pine trees. It made us forget the long hard climb we just did. It hardly took us 20 minutes to reach Dandapauwa and another 10 minutes to Ramkot Bazaar.

It was past one in the afternoon, and we were starving. Our lunch included, as it often did on our rides, our favourite dal-bhat. The food, contrary to the lady owner’s heaping praise on it, tasted bland. But we ate our fill as we were hungry. At least, the carb from dal-bhat would help on the gruelling incline that followed next.
After a half-hour time-out, we hit the road again and headed southwest in the direction of Kalu Pandey Hills. It suddenly struck me a slight detour to Bhim Dunga would not be a bad idea and take not very long. So, we took the turn-off to our right.
Detour
I had heard a lot about the stiff climbs to Kalu Pandey. But the one-half kilometre to Bhim Dunga turned out the ‘mother of all uphills’ and a mountain biker’s worst nightmare. Even Shayeet, who considered himself a tough uphiller, had to get off his bike and push. For me, even shoving my bike on that gradient seemed punishing, let alone riding.


After sweating it out for almost 25 minutes on the incline, the sight of the crest came as a welcome respite. That was the second ridge we had scaled that day.

Not ‘Bhim Dhunga’
A little away from habitation, the ridge bore a large stone altar with three gajurs (pinnacles) built on the raised ground. It gave the impression of a midget temple. The front of the stonework included two deities, one was the Ganesh hands down, but I could not place the other chiselled form as it was little disfigured, which stood with one arm holding what looked like a Gada (mace).
As I still wondered about the deity, an elderly fellow arrived on the scene and said the figure belonged to Bhimsen. To my great delight, he also threw light upon the history of the place. “Everyone seems to call this place ‘Bhim Dhunga’, but the actual name happens to be ‘Bhim Dunga’, dunga for a boat,” he explained and gave an account of the ancient folklore.

As the legend goes, Bhimsen of Mahabharat fame in days of Kali Yuga (3,102 BC) once happened to visit the ridge, which served as a ledge above a huge lake, said to be present Kathmandu Valley. Spellbound, he wished to explore the waters. He sent for a boat and took a ride. “That is said to have named the place Bhim Dunga,” he summed up. The grueling ride to Bhim Dunga, after all, turned out well worth a visit.
After a brief breather, we struck northeast towards Kalu Pandey. I had the feeling we would be doing another formidable climb as the forthcoming destination was higher than Bhim Dunga. My instinct came right. Hardly had we finished a downhill section, the road that branched out to Kalu Pandey took on a steep climb. The only upside to it was its paved sections.

Some 45 minutes struggling on the long steep climb, we arrived at a flatter section. The place turned out to be Switzerland Park, lately a popular getaway. We stopped for tea at a shop next to the park. The fellow-owner graciously cast light upon how the place came to be called by that name, which sounded nothing but out of place.
The story went like that. About a decade ago, when there were no roads, only walking trails to the hills of Dahachok, a group of Swiss backpackers happened to hike there with a guide, a local from the village. The hills then held pristine locales—untouched, rarely explored, free of pollution, and miles away from the chaos of the metropolis.

“Sheer bliss,” uttered one of the Swiss backpackers, impressed. “This place reminds me of my own country back home,” he told the guide. The guide, at social gatherings or when dropping by the local teashops to chat with friends and co-villagers, often waxed eloquent on that incident.  Soon, word got around in pigeon circle in the small village.
The local villagers began calling the place Switzerland Danda (hill), wooing every hiker that went by.  A few years later, someone from the village came up with the idea of turning it into a park. “In recent years, the park has become a popular picnic venue for Kathmandu people. If you come here on weekends, the park virtually turns into a carnival with loudspeakers belting out blaring music heard miles away,” he said with a grin.
We entered the park and took a fleeting look around. Much to our dismay, the place stank, and the ugly tin-roofed shelters looked hideous—only serving as a blot on the landscape. Piles of trash littered the sides into the bargain. Disappointed, we left for our final destination of the day, Kalu Pandey Memorial Park, hoping it would not let us down.

"Shantidham: After lockdown, visit this hallowed site in Kathmandu","Thursday, April 30, 2020","I thought I would be strong enough in a week to ride my mountain bike again to Shantidham snugly tucked away amidst lush woods in the verdant hills of Kavresthali.
The little mishap I had in the last ride prevented me, however, from riding for almost two weeks. Some 50 yards before the holy site, a dog suddenly attacked, and I took a nasty fall. My left elbow and my bruised knee hurt severely from the knock. I made it to the holy site, though.
My long experience has taught me not to attempt far-off remote places alone, and by no account, after dark, a rule of thumb every biker—a beginner or old hand—should follow. I broke the rule that day.
Flashback
On a ride to Kavresthali hills, I was sipping tea at a teashop at Sangla when I overheard a woman talking animatedly to the owner lady, about having seen the holy temple of Badrinath in Shantidham. I could not believe my ears. I had only known the Badrinath Dham located in Uttarakhand, India. “It is just four kilometres away from here,” she said. I could not wait to hop onto my saddle. Although a little late in the afternoon, I rode off, consumed with the thought of seeing the temple for myself.
Some half-hour later, at the arch sign: “Way to Shantidham.” The lady I met had asked me to take a better road one-half kilometre further down. But I kept on as I thought it would save time and be back home before dark. As I pedalled uphill, shortly, I had to get off my bike as the dirt track was too steep and badly washed out by past monsoon rains.

Soon I realised I was the only soul around. The track led uphill into woods with no sign of any habitation. As thick shrubs and the woods started, it suddenly occurred chances of wild animals from the Shivpuri National Park straying into them at dusk were not unlikely.
Sightings of both leopards, and at times black bears, were often reported in fringe areas of the park, including Kavresthali hills. Had it been daytime, not much to worry, but after dark, it was a different story.
In two minds
Shadows lengthened, signalling an approach of dusk. I began to waver, torn between two minds. One told me, to back out, the other kept goading me—no guts, no glory—I should not give up.   The dense woods got quieter as I dragged my bike uphill. Birds seemed to end their flurry to slowly turn-in, winding up their dusk chorus.
My restless mind started seeing things in darkened shrubs that looked menacing. The debate between my inner voices continued. Before long, darkness fell, and I switched on my lights. Except for my heavy breathing, and the bike’s dragging sound, the total hush felt spooky. I kept going, weary and edgy, though.
Soon, trees and underbrush seemed to play tricks on my eyes as the beam of light fell upon them. What was that? Did I hear a rustling in the nearby shrub? Perhaps, a leopard lurking in the undergrowth? My imagination ran riot.
Even the faint sound of a stream in the stillness felt too loud. Then a hoot of an owl tore through the silence. I froze. I was near panic when, suddenly, I saw an illumination some 50 yards ahead, on the darkened hill. Phew, hope at last!
Off to Shantidham
I had my old partner, Shayeet, accompany me the second ride to Shantidham. We chose the dirt road I had backtracked on my earlier trip. My elbow and knee still hurt a little despite the fortnight rest.
It barely took us half-hour from our residence at Milan Tole, Tokha Road, to Manmaiju heights. We then took a downhill that led to open fields with stubbles from cut paddy.
As we crossed a sullied stream, a strong stench filled our nostrils from pig and poultry farms spread out along the track. “Ugh, what disgusting smell,” cried out Shayeet.
Thati Chowk
A little later, we met a paved road that headed north. Shortly, we were at Thati Chowk, Pipalbot, Kavresthali. A huge pipal tree (Ficus religiosa) bounded by a Shiva temple stood in the middle of the road. A bit further, we stopped for tea at Sangam Chowk. Tea stalls and shops flanked the street.


After a refreshing cup of buffalo-milk-tea (my favourite) and a breather, we hit a dirt track. The country road ran across farmland with roadside houses. As lush-rolling hills rose in north, terraced fields gradually descended to the sprawling city core.
Every time I rode that route, the wayside seemed to roll up more houses, while trees and foliage receded. The countryside looked all set to make rapid inroads into urban sprawl. It was, though, gratifying to the eyes and the mind to see what little tilled land and lush foliage the countryside still held.
Ten minutes later, the dirt road headed down a slope to a copse of trees and met a fork. The left had an arch-gate that read: Shantidham Entrance, Welcome. The right went to Bihani Chowk. Next followed a gruelling incline.

Gurukul
We stopped by a temple called Shimleswor Mahadev to recover our breath and sip water from our bottle. Next to the shrine, we saw students from a Sanskrit academy, engaged in some game. They seemed curious to share some knowledge about their Gurukul (seminary) with us. Shayeet even had them grouped up for a photograph.

To our great displeasure, the climb did not let up for what seemed a lifetime. We but kept on stoically, both riding and walking our bikes. “Uncle, this uphill must be the toughest we have done together,” 19-year old Shayeet remarked.  As I reflected on that, I patted myself on the back and smiled because I was 67 and still going strong.
The road left behind houses and shops and entered the woods.  Suddenly, the place appeared familiar as I spotted the fork. Then it flashed on my mind the road that went down I had come last time.
Shortly, I noticed the house where the dog attacked me on my previous ride, and I crashed. I told Shayeet to be on guard as it might rush at us. To our great relief, there was no sign of the dog. Ten minutes later, we made it to Shantidham.

Shantidham
I had looked upon the internet the photographs of Badrinath Temple, located in Uttarakhand, India before we started. The temple was indeed a commendable work at replicating the authentic edifice from India.

As I looked closely, I noticed the temple building at Shantidham had red-tiled roof, whereas the picture on the internet showed Badrinath Temple from India with a gilded roof. Other disparities on the façade appeared insignificant.

Shantidham, however, included additional structures like the tall column that held on top idols of different deities. An annex provided living quarters for priests and the Swamiji, the founder of the holy establishment.

I noticed a raised pulpit in the forecourt for religious recitations from the Swamiji. The striking feature, as the name Shantidham suggested, was the tranquil surroundings bounded by tall mix trees including pine, and shrub jungle. As lush wooded hills rose in the northwest, the elevation afforded a view of distant mountains and the Kathmandu Valley.


An inscription on the column in the forecourt read, “Inaugurated in 2074 BS by the President, Mrs Bidya Devi Bhandari.” One of the pillars of the annex building caught my attention. It held a display-board that included names of financial donors to the establishment; some amounts crossed six figures.
Shortly, Shayeet and I entered the temple building to pay our homage. The main gate opened to a courtyard with verandahs on three sides. A red-tile three-tier pagoda-style tall minaret stood in the middle.  Idols of Jaya-Vijaya, the dwarpalakas (gatekeepers) to Lord Vishnu, flanked the doorway.
The main chamber housed a black granite idol of Lord Vishnu, festooned with ornate gold necklaces. I noticed one of them included a pendant shaped into an ‘Om’ symbol. An automated dholak (drum) used during the arati ritual sat at one corner.

As an intricate silver shade hung over the idol of Lord Vishnu, a gilded halo surrounded the bust. Lord Vishnu donned a jewelled crown holding a Sudarshan Chakra (a spinning disc used by the god as weapons) with the index finger of his right hand and a conch by his left.
Going by Hindu theology, Gods Rama and Krishna are considered the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu is also said to be part of the Hindu Trimurti (a triad of three gods), or the sacred ‘Hindu Trinity’ as Brahma, the Creator; Shiva, the Destroyer; and Vishnu, the Preserver. Photography inside the chamber was not allowed.

Swamiji
As I missed out on my last visit meeting the principal founder of Shantidham, Swamiji, Shri Chaturbhujacharya Chundamani Maharaji, I could not wait to see him. I hastened to ask the priest, Kumar Acharya, to arrange an audience with Swamiji.  Kumarji not only informed me the Swami was available but also obliged by arranging the meeting.
We did not have to wait long. In less than 10 minutes, a bearded man dressed in a saffron dhoti, a kameez, and a shawl, wrapped around his shoulder, looking in his early 30s, with long flowing locks and a big sandalwood tika on his forehead, appeared; that was Swamiji.
In response to my Namaste, he smiled back with folded hands and motioned us to the raised dais built for pravachans or preachings from Swamiji, and seated himself before a small desk. Before I could put a question, Swamiji broke into a chant and recited a Sanskrit shloka (verse). I waited patiently.
To my question what inspired him to set upon the formidable task of building the holy temple of Badrinath in Shantidham, the Swamiji appeared very composed: “During my stay in India, I came across many Nepali pilgrims travelling to Chardham, namely: Rameswaram, Jagannath Puri, Dwarka, and the Badrinath. Most of them included elderly people.”
“For them,” Swamiji continued, “Travelling hundreds of miles in India was extremely demanding. First, it involved a lot of expenses, not everyone could afford it; and secondly, travelling long distances by buses and trains in India for the Nepalis was arduous and hectic. A lot of people fell ill, especially the elderly.”
After a little pause, Swamiji added, “So, it just struck me if the Nepali devotees could pay their homage to those four holy places right here in Nepal, it would save them all the hassle, time and money.”
“With the blessings and divine favour of God and the support of the devotees, we have at this stage completed the first project, the Badrinath Temple. The future will have the rest of three dhams, too,” concluded Swamiji reciting a shloka.
Later, Swamiji shared with me his early days at Varanasi, India, where he studied Sanskrit and completed his Vidyavaridhi (PhD). He also taught at different Sanskrit colleges in India. He travelled extensively to a great many holy places in India before venturing out on this mission single-mindedly.
As Swamiji left the rostrum, I could not help admire his staunch dedication to embark upon the ambitious task for the cause of the Nepali devotees. He sounded confident and determined.
In hindsight
As we left, it crossed my mind, maybe, I’d not have made the second visit to Shantidham if I had backed off that day, or perhaps I mused amusingly, become a perfect dinner for the leopard lurking behind the shrubs. I kept wondering our way back home what drove me to it against my better judgment.
How to go?
First, go to Balaju Bypass (Machha Pokhari) and head for Nepaltar. At Nepaltar, after crossing a bridge close to an army barrack, take a left turn and head for Jarankhu. The road goes along the Sheshmati River (Mahadev Khola). After Jarankhu, go towards Sangam Chowk. After half a kilometre from Sangam Chowk towards Bihani Chowk, you will see an arch-gate to your left with a sign that reads Shantidham. Just follow the road. The distance to the Dham is three kilometres from Sangam Chowk.

Dolakha: A village-town that never tires to lure visitors (Part III),"Tuesday, April 21, 2020","Forget Covid-19 and think of places you can visit after the lockdown
Perhaps some of you have been tired of hearing about the coronavirus crisis and its impact on daily life, time and again. Obviously, it is important for you to get aware of what’s happening in the world due to the newly discovered virus and keep yourself protected. However, it is also time to get away with the Covid-19 obsession.
Before the lockdown began, Onlinekhabar had presented you two travel stories about Dolakha. Now, it’s time to go through the final part.
—
Dolakha’s Tripura Sundari (Goddess Bhagawati), closely associated with the legend of the town, succeeds as another most revered deity after Bhimeswor.  Housed in a temple-building called Devikot, the sacred site is located some 200 yards down stone stairs from the Bhimeswor Temple. The building was recently rebuilt after it was razed to the ground by the April 2015 earthquake.
Tucked away on a quiet and isolated forested ridge, the temple premises is adjoined by a beautiful park called Champuja, which treats the visitors with a stunning view of the Gaurishankar Himal, the Sunkhani village on the other side of the hill followed by the Dolti river valley and lush rolling hills that drop steeply to the river Tamakoshi. A dense forest called the Kanlad skirts the edifice on three sides.
At Tripura Sundari, visitors are barred from viewing the main deity. Only the main priest is entitled to perform a puja on behalf of the devotees. Believed by the local folks to have been built before the Mahabharat era or the Dwapar Yuga, this shrine is shrouded in mystery and occult beliefs.
“In the olden times, people feared to visit this temple premises after sundown,” says Shyam Shrestha, a member of the temple guthi (trust). Those who mistakenly wandered off to the temple surroundings after sunset went missing; they were devoured by the demons that lurked nearby the site,” reveals Shrestha. Surprisingly, the locals of Dolakha still hold the deity with fear and respect and balk at the idea of visiting the temple after dark.
Newar settlement
Home to a rich culture and tradition, Dolakha town is predominantly a Newar settlement. The Newari dialect from Dolakha is, however, way different from that of Kathmandu. Nonetheless, both languages have some words with identical meanings, like ja (rice), baji (beaten rice), chen (house), khan (talk), Mahani (the Dashain festival), kija (brother), kehen (sister), to cite a few.
Like their peers in Kathmandu, the Newars from Dolakha are represented by Shresthas, Pradhans, Joshis, Maskeys, and Rajbhandaris. Going by the Puranas (ancient scripture), the Dolakha language saw its birth during the Mahabharat era when the Panch Pandavas (the protagonists of the epic), sentenced to one year in exile, went into hiding in Dolakha.
To keep themselves incognito, the five Pandava brothers conceived this unique dialect. Another school of thought, however, believes that the Dolakha language has its roots in Kathmandu Newari and was introduced by itinerant traders and government incumbents assigned to the town for a prolonged sojourn. Some, however, argue that the people of Dolakha evolved their indigenous language to suit local customs and environment, and may have adapted a little from the migrant Newari dialect from Kantipur or ancient Kathmandu. The issue is still in the dark and open to controversy. And the history of ancient Nepal has little to offer.
Curiously, the Dolakha dialect also embraces expressions from other ethnic communities like the Thamis, the Sherpas, and the Tamangs. Amazing as it may sound, even the Bengali word ‘taka’ meaning currency is used in the Dolakha dialect with the identical meaning.  This seems to offer linguists a challenging case fora deeper study.
Bucket list
While in Dolakha, your itinerary can include a cluster of unique destinations on your bucket list. Short hikes can allow room for a trip to Nagdaha, Sunkhani, Busti, and Saharpa to enjoy the pristine countryside, or make your mouth water with fresh-caught asla (snow trout) from the river Tamakoshi at the teahouses at Nayapul, some 20 km away.
Given a clear morning, the village folks claim a short 45-minute walk to the crest of a hill called Trishulcha, north of the Dolakha Bazaar, allows you to clap your eyes on the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest (8,848 m) behind a panoply of lofty peaks including Melungtse Himal (7,181m). As the spot also holds a deity, local devotees often visit the place to offer a puja (worship).
A jeep ride from Charikot/Makaibari to the ancient pilgrimage site, the Kalinchok Bhagwati (3,842 m) is a dream destination. Recently, a cable car service came into operation, which shuttles visitors to Kalinchok from Kuri.
Another destination, a Sherpa village called Beding (3,700 m), once referred to as the land of Everest summiteers, is a three-four-day trek, leading to the picturesque Rolwaling Valley at the base of the Gaurishankar—serving as truly a lifetime experience.
For anthropologists, the ethnic Thami villages like Sushpa, Kshyamawati, Khopachagu, Alampu, and Bigu offer a great opportunity to study those rare communities whose numbers are on a rapid dwindling trend.
Jiri, a town often compared with Zurich in Switzerland, is only 55 km away. Before the construction of an airstrip at Lukla, Jiri served as a gateway to Namche and the Khumbu or the Everest Region, and once boasted as the summiteers’ hub.
The trek to Shailung Danda (3,150 m), also known as the ‘land of 100 hills’ is worth its weight in gold. What distinguishes the highland moor is the amazing sight of midget hills that roll out by the hundred. You can take a bus to Mude and trek the dirt road to the spot, some 25 km away. The site also offers another pilgrimage called the Salilungeswor Mahadev at an elevation of 3,500 m.
The high elevation of Shailung affords a stunning Himalayan panorama stretching from Dhaulaigiri, Annapurna, the entire Langtang Range to Ganesh Himal and the Rolwaling region. To the north, stands high the Kalinchok ridge. It is said a distant view of Kathmandu Valley in the north-west and the Tarai plains in the south can be viewed on a clear morning.
If you fancy visiting monasteries, a two-day trek to a village called Bigu will charm you with its seminary for Buddhist nuns (anis). Or, maybe you are hung up on some hardcore trekking and wish to attempt Tsho Rolpo, Nepal’s biggest glacier at 4,581m, which was once under threat of bursting in the late 1990s. You will, however, need professional help, and specific gear for this is an arduous trek.
For accommodations, Dolakha has a number of lodges and resorts catering to your needs. Visitors can also stay the night in Charikot, 4.5 km away, if need be.
Folklore and myths
Apart from a rich culture and history, Dolakha is shrouded in folklore and dark mystery.  The village elders in Dolakha still believe those who perform as Gods, in the Khadga Jatra celebrated every Dashain, are visited by the Gods–and a few chosen ones, are possessed. The festival marks the triumph of virtue over the forces of evil as the Gods put an end to the terror begot by the danavs (demons). Pitched battles take place between the gods and the demons as a part of the festival.
A wooded hill southwest of the town called the Saharpa has weird lore attached to it. “During the days of our forefathers, people from Korchhe Tole (street) often went to Saharpa Danda (hill) to collect firewood. That went on for many years,” Parwati Shrestha from the Tallo Tole said as she recounted the bizarre happening that took place.
“One day, however, a strange incident took place at Saharpa,” she continued. “A group of woodcutters turned mute on their return to their neighbourhood. That occurred again with a band of another group from Korchhe. Now, that was a serious matter. So, a shaman was summoned to find the solution followed by a puja to the forest goddess at Saharpa. Miraculously, people stopped getting mute after that,” she concluded. The Saharpa hills can be easily sighted from Dolkha town.
Coup de grace
On April 25, 2015, the ground beneath the quiet little town shook violently as the massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake jolted Nepal. The Dolakha district, among others, was the hardest hit. Still reeling from the traumatic condition with a great loss of life and property, Dolakha was struck again on May 12, 2015, by another disastrous 7.3 magnitude quake bringing in its wake further devastation that dealt a crippling blow to the already tottering infrastructure.
Almost 90 per cent of the historical monuments and relics were razed to the ground by the quake. Apart from the great loss of human lives, the town looked all but a grisly scene of mass destruction and mayhem. By some small miracle, the Bhimeswor, the most revered temple of the Dolakhes (people of Dolakha town), save for some minor damages, survived unscathed.
Dolakha, however, lost virtually all those vintage stone-and-mortar houses, which had survived the epic earthquake of 1934 (1990 BS). One such house included my grandfather’s, which had weathered 150 years and lived in by three generations. But miracles do happen. An older than 300-years-old house survived the earthquake (view picture in this story’s part II).
It seemed the ill-fated town would never regain its former self. Dolakha revived from the catastrophe slowly, though. It took almost three hard years to get back on her feet again. The famed Tripura Sundari Temple, reduced to rubbles by the large temblors, is rebuilt today. So are more than 90 per cent of other relics and monuments scattered around the town to their past splendour.
It looks like Dolakha has lost none of its enduring charisma and promise, both as a pilgrimage and a memorable getaway. The people of Dolakha have proudly preserved their ancient relics and monuments and upheld their faith in their tradition, culture and religion to this day. And the tiny medieval town still stays to charm curious visitors time and again.

Dolakha: A village town that never tires to lure visitors (Part II),"Friday, March 20, 2020","“Syau-dai,” with that word someone called. I turned around. A smiling young woman in her early twenties coyly bowed her head down before me as she uttered the word; a faint blush tinted her cheeks. I did not even know who she was. I took a little courage and asked and learned that she was a distant cousin. That was in Dolakha town. (Read the first part)
I had a guest, a Kathmandu friend, who’d tagged along to spend his holidays. We were in Dolakha, my ancestral home, to watch the Khadga Jatra (sword festival) celebrated annually during Dashain celebrations.  As we took a tour of the town, more ‘syau-dais’ came my way and I had to do the same when I ran into my seniors.
One big family
My friend seemed thrilled to bits to watch the trading of syau-dais every once in a while. Every newcomer to the town is—as this ritual seems like clockwork automata as it were the entire town was like one big family and you were amidst them. And this seemingly unusual phenomenon finds its answer if we backtrack a little in time.
In the yesteryears, the remoteness cut off Dolakha from the rest of Nepal, and it got virtually confined to its own four walls—so were the marriage practices. And for this reason, boys and girls wedded each other from among the scanty population. Eventually, family ties developed as the lineage came either from the father or the mother. With the advent of roads and better communication, the migrating trend to cities boomed amongst the later generations. This brought in its wake a spread in marriage practices sweeping far and wide with kinship ties to Kathmandu and the rest of the country.
History
The town of Dolakha, with its humble setting and fetching landscapes, unspoiled countryside, lush forests, and the towering hills under the shadow of lofty snow-clad peaks the likes of Mount Gaurishankar, has always held a lasting appeal to the holidaymakers.
Behind this modest façade, the little town, however, hides behind a deep-seated history, a past enigmatic era rich in tradition, religion, and cultural heritage. For the entire Dolakha district (2,191 square km), named after this small nondescript town, speaks for its vibrant old days.
As cobbled alleys and pathways crisscross the town, almost every street corner seems to hold a shrine reminiscent of Kathmandu city. Well planned as a city during the Malla era (1,200-1768 AD), not surprisingly, Dolakha earned its name as a city of temples.
History has it that after a trade link was established between Tibet and India as far back as the reign of Amshuverma in the Lichhavi period (early 7th century), Dolakha rose to prominence as one of the transit points via Kuti in Tibet to Kathmandu valley and eastern Nepal.
As a district, Dolakha annexes Solukhumbu and Ramechhap in the east, Sindhupalchok in the west, Ramechhap in the south, and China (Tibet) in the north. History reveals that Dolakha served as an independent state and saw the rule of the Kirants, the Lichhavis and ultimately the Mallas until the unification of Nepal brought in by King Prithivi Naryan Shah. The Malla King bowed down to the firepower of the Gurkhas without a shot being fired or a sword raised.
Once a thriving city and a trade route to Tibet until the end of the Malla era, historians believe that in 1534 AD, King Jaya Indra Singh of Dolakha initiated the first-ever silver coins of Nepal to facilitate trade with Tibet. They also claim that the first coins of Kantipur (Kathmandu) came later in the reign of King Mahendra Malla, subsequent to the death of Jaya Indra Singh. This historic house which served as the ancient taksar (mint) still exists at a place called Dandathok.
Relics and temples galore
As cobbled alleys and pathways intertwine the town, almost every street corner seems to hold a temple authentically evocative of Kathmandu city. After a tour of the town, what strikes a visitor, especially a Kathmanduite as strange, is to find almost all the major Hindu temples of Kathmandu in the town. Shrines such as the Pashupatinath, Bajrayogini, Harisiddhi, Narayan, Manjushree, Rato (Red) Machhindranath, Taleju Bhawani (Rajkuleswor), Ganesh Mandir and many more, enhance the town’s image as a repository of Hindu temples matching that of the ancient Kantipuri Nagari (Kathmandu).
Curiously, for a small town, apart from a horde of Hindu temples, stupas and domed chaityas (chortens) also make their presence felt as you explore further.  “According to folklore, these stupas date back more than 800 years and are said to have been founded by the Malla rulers,” says Shanta Krishna Shrestha, a senior resident of Dolakha. The presence of those Buddhist relics in Dolakha reflects the coexistence of diverse religious customs and beliefs in the olden times.
No different from Kathmandu
Steeped in age-old traditions, the little Dolakha is also marked by a score of festivals, redolent of Kathmandu. One of the most celebrated is the Khadga Jatra (sword festival, also celebrated in Kathmandu). Come Dashain, the entire town comes alive, and the ancient ritual is carried out, in full pomp and pageantry as the town buzzes with festivity from dawn to dusk with kith and kin streaming in from Kathmandu and other cities to enjoy happy reunions with their families.
Other notable festivals similar to that of Kathmandu and Lalitpur include Kumari Jatra, Indra Jatra, Hile Jatra, Gai Jatra, and Rato Machhindranath Yatra, among others. Once, every year, the colourfully decked out Rato Macchindranath chariot is steered across the entire town of Dolakha amidst a cacophony of sight and sound as the crowd tugs at the rope recreating the same vibe when the festival is celebrated in Lalitpur.

Dolakha’s flagship
Dolakha’s identity lies with its most prized possession, and venerated deity, the Bhimeswor. Outsiders associate the little town with God Bhimsen, the second born of the Pandavas, said to possess the strength of 10,000 elephants. Situated northeast of the town on a knoll, the Bhimeswor temple is believed to have been built in the 7th century AD.
Characterised by unique roofless architecture, the temple houses the deity not in the form of a robust idol, but simply as a nine-inch tall stone effigy resembling a lingam. Entwined by a gilded metal snake, the sacred black stone carries a small nick at the top. A 15-foot tall stone column said to be carved out from a single rock stands at the entrance of the shrine. A bronze idol of a lion rests on the top.  Several other shorter columns stand around the temple ground.
Bestowed upon with three avatars (incarnations), namely the Bhagawati, Shiva, and ultimately Bhima or Bhimsen, the mythological god of Mahabharat, the puja rites are performed correspondingly to appease the triumvirate deities.
The legendary Bhimsen is also consecrated as the god of trade and commerce by business communities. Widely held as a holy pilgrimage, the devotees to the shrine include Indian nationals too. “Dolakha saw this trend from days beyond recall, even when no roads connected the town, and people had to walk for more than 15 days from Kathmandu,” the local priest at the temple explained.
The visits to Bhimeswor intensified after the Lamosanghu-Jiri Road came into operation. Today, devotees by the score swarm the shrine, especially on Fridays, Saturdays, Tuesdays, and the town turns abuzz with activity. If you ask the Kathmandu residents, surprisingly, most seem to have already visited the shrine, some even several times. Young motorcyclists can be seen in bands arriving on Fridays to stay the night, pay their homage, take a tour of the town and leave the next day or the day after.
Sweating spells
The stone effigy of Bhimeswor is known to go into bizarre sweating spells, portending a national crisis or disaster. The idol is said to have perspired profusely preceding the colossal earthquake of 1934 AD (1990 BS), the independence from Rana rule in 1951 (2007 BS), the demise of Panchayat government in 1990, and the royal carnage of June 1, 2001, at the Naryanhiti Palace, to cite a few.

Dolakha: A village-town that never tires to lure visitors,"Wednesday, March 11, 2020","Curiously, it seems a humble little hill town just 135 km away, or a six-hour bus ride to the northeast of Kathmandu, never ceases to lure visitors. “I’ve been to the place four times,” shared a Newar resident of Kathmandu with me.
I met another, who seemed hung-up on driving his motorbike to the town, three years in a row. He sounded like a confirmed habitué of the town. That little quintessential but charismatic village town is Dolakha.
Travel minutiae
Traveling to Dolakha itself is a delight for the visitors who get the prospect of getting fleeting glances of busy highway towns such as Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panchkhal. As the bus cruises past Dhulikhel, weather permitting, and if you happen to have a seat next to the window on the left, the north opens up to lofty snow-capped peaks towering above a deep river valley.
The bus pulls up for a routine stop at the bustling town of Dolalghat, tucked away at the confluence of two snow-fed Koshis (rivers) that have travelled down a considerable distance from the Himalayas, bounding and frolicking over huge boulders and rocks, across many a river valley—none other than, the Sunkoshi, and the Indrawati (a tributary of Sunkoshi).
The hawkers call out loudly, swarming the bus and flaunting before your window sundries from mineral water, wafer chips, and bananas to cucumbers. As the town is popular for fish, you cannot miss out on the sharp aroma of fried fish, which wafts in through the windows.
If you wish, the bus conductor can be generous enough to let you bound to one of those many roadside vendors, and grab some to savour later in the comfort of your seat. The fish, some 15 years ago, was caught from the two Koshis. Do not bet on it these days. Today, they are not.
Kholako machha
With the rapid flooding of roadside teahouses, soon, the burgeoning demand could not be met. To meet the urgency, the teahouses were supplied with pond-reared fish (from as far off as Janakpur), which easily passed for “local kholako machha” (river fish).
Story behind
The story some two decades ago was, however, different. Both the Koshis teemed with fish from snow trout, catfish, Bhote Gadelo (loach) to eels, and even the legendary Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora). As the demand soared, it led to the unethical method of fishing, such as blasting (using gelignite), poisoning, and electro-fishing by crude homemade gadgets.
The continued poaching at the massive scale virtually decimated the resident fish (especially the snow trout) all along the highway. In recent years, the riverine life has seen grave depletion, the length and breadth of our country all along the riverside highway-towns—a stark reality to reckon with.
After Dolalghat, the river Sunkoshi to your right provides you company with tranquil pools and white-water rapids as it drifts southward by the wooded hills.  As the drive progresses, the town of Sukute slips by.
At Sukute, if you care to look out the window to your right, you will notice several resorts, large and small, by the boisterous Sunkoshi. In recent years, you will find those resorts crawling with holiday-makers, come weekends.
After some 15 km, the ride takes a pit stop for tea and refreshments at Khadichaur, half-way point to Dolakha. A subsidiary road links the Arniko Highway to its right, which heads south over an iron bridge across the river Sunkoshi. Some call the river Bhotekoshi, too. Named the Poiqu in Tibet, it is named Bhotekoshi after it flows into Nepal at Kodari but after the town of Barhabise, it is called Sunkoshi.
The narrower Swiss-engineered road after crossing the bridge is called the Lamoshangu-Jiri Marg (road), which takes you to Charikot, Dolakha, and Jiri. What strikes you most, once you board off the bus at Khadichaur, is the rows upon rows, of shops that flank the road selling Chinese goods from blankets, chinaware, and electronics to piano-keyboards. You name it, they have got it.
Hill country
After the bus rolls on the Jiri road, it’s hill country, all the way. The narrower road climbs along in a maze of twists, loops and hairpin bends. For those, who just had dal-bhat  at Khadichaur, the ride could mean battling a brewing queasiness as the food gets mighty churned-up inside their bellies, to say nothing of the scary sights of sheer drops that compounds the misery.
For close to one hour, the bus lurches on the gut-wrenching switchbacks. Dense woods, terraced fields, and small Tamang settlements streak past. After villages like Sano Pakhar and Thulo Pakhar, the bus slides by a beautiful pine-studded hill.
Savoury potatoes
After another half-an-hour, the bus pulls up at Mude (2,500 m) for a tea break. The elevation affords a stunning view in the north of snow-clad peaks, including the Kalinchok ridge. The South opens to terraced fields that dramatically drop to a narrow river valley.
Mude is known for savoury potatoes, and if you happen to visit through the season, you cannot miss out on the sacks of potatoes stacked high by the roadside shop fronts.  Also, you can see people making a beeline before the shops to buy them to take back home. The highland also happens to be a crossing-point to another pilgrimage site and a scenic location called Shailung Hills (3,150 m), some 20 km southeast.
Given the high elevation of Mude, a chill in the air and briskness in the atmosphere appears tangible. The place invites thick fogs in the wintertime, and constant mist and drizzle mark the monsoon months. After a brief respite, the bus leaves Mude.
Within ten minutes, Kharidhunga (2,540 m), the site of an abandoned magnesite quarry and the highest point on the way to Dolakha, arrives. After this point, you leave behind Shindupalchok and enter the district of Dolakha.
At Kharidungha, the vista changes to a sub-alpine terrain with moorlands. Snowfall occurs each winter at Mude, and Kharidhunga, and lures merrymakers from as far away as Kathmandu. In recent years, Kharidhunga has rapidly turned into a touristy spot as more and more people are frequenting the high moorland.
The road, as it descends, involves more causeways, minuscule waterfalls, sheer drops, ravines, and the lovely countryside for its bucolic setting. The steep descent, thereafter, eases at a wooded gully with a cascade on the left. The water flows under a bridge to disappear into a deep ravine with a shrub forest. The scenic spot is called Boch, and the fast-tumbling stream, Charangé.
Before the roads
Before 1985, Dolakha had no access by motor road. People first travelled by bus to Barhabise, a small settlement then, located on the banks of the Bhotekoshi. Then, it took one night and two days, on foot, to Dolakha. The foot-trail traversed across tiny villages like Jaljale, Rol Khani, Boch, Makaibari, Charikot, and then the last leg of the journey to Dolakha.  The present road is said to intercept those long-lost and forgotten trails at a few places.
The bus ploughs on the incline, moving past terraced fields that ripple down as far as your eyes travel until an old village-town called Makaibari (meaning ‘cornfield’) appears. Fifteen minutes later, after a long quiet ride, you reach Charikot to find the town, abuzz with brisk life and movement, and, little surprise, with blasting music reminiscent of shanty Tarai towns as you enter the core bazaar area.
At almost 1800 m, Charikot, as the district headquarters of Dolakha, with tall roadside buildings, assumes the perfect picture of a booming highway town. Hotels, resorts, tea houses, lodges, shops, and more shops line the road. And big crowds and frenetic activities mark the main streets.
At the town square, the highway divides. As the main expressway runs to Jiri, a side road bears due east to Dolakha town, 4.5 km away. As the bus leaves the crossroads and heads towards Dolakha, you cannot fail to ignore in the eastern horizon the towering snow-clad massif with Mount Gaurishankar stealing the show.
Town without Fear
A 20-minute drive downhill takes you across sloping terraced fields and sparsely inhabited landscape.  As you peer over the hillside, you can get the distant view of the river Tamakoshi, winding its course through a narrow gorge formed by the forested hills.
As you approach the town, the cluster of houses thicken, but nothing like Charikot; no fancy buildings, and none of that haphazard over-spilling of houses. At the tail-end of the paved road, the bus pulls up at the pit stop, Pakhalati, and Dolakha town, or going by its ancient name, ‘Abhayapur,’ the Town without Fear, greets you.
As the local folklore goes, Dolakha, in the olden times, was called Abhayapur—‘Abhaya,’ without fear, and ‘pur,’ a town. Ancient myth has it that since Dolakha and its inhabitants enjoyed the blessings, and patronage of God Bhimsen, the mythical hero of the epic Mahabharata, it was christened Abhayapur.
Abhayapur, with the elapsing of time, was renamed Dolakha.  The word Dolakha is believed to have its origin in the Tibetan vernacular. Do in Tibetan stands for a stone, la translates to a temple while kha implies a house, as such signifying a town with many stone temples and houses.
Quaint town
Upon arrival at Dolakha, what strikes the first-timer as strange is her unbelievable simplicity and that warm ambiance. In stark contrast to Charikot, Dolakha, seemingly impervious to rapid modernisation, impresses as a quiet and unassuming town with understated elegance.
“Charikot, previously a drab village with a cluster of hamlets scattered around a hillside, shot to a burgeoning town with slipshod sprawling when the Lamoshanghu-Jiri Highway cut through the place. The highway did not converge with Dolakha town, and it remained a nondescript village town,” said Bikram Malla, a resident of Chamsali Tole, Dolakha. “A link road was built to access Dolakha after only two years. But all that proved a blessing in disguise, as our town was spared the trappings of haphazard development,” he further added.
After the unsightly urban sprawl of Charikot, Dolakha is like a sight for sore eyes. The place impresses you nothing short of a hill resort. The town hugs a wooded hillside that gradually descends into a ripple of fertile terraced smallholdings that drop abruptly way down to the Tamakoshi at the foothills of forested hills as the river snakes its course across a gorge.
The view of the river and the gorge is stunning. So is the eastern skyline as your eyes lock with the towering Gaurishankar Himal (7,134 m) in all its grandeur. The twin peaks synonymous with Lord Shiva (Shankar) and his consort Gauri (Parwati) is flanked by Melungste Himal (7,181 m) as the Rolwaling range undulates under an ocean-blue canopy. As the sun dips in the horizon and the sky turns a crimson hue, you hear a bell toll in the distance. That’s the Bhimeswor Shrine, the jewel in the crown of Dolakha, glowing in all its glory.

Wonder happens when a Madhesi man does ice climbing in Manang,"Tuesday, February 25, 2020","Despite being born in Terai, I had a deep desire to get familiar with the hardship of mountains, and the beauty that accompanies the hardship. I had seen some snowy peaks from far away, but such moments had never satisfied me.
This February, however, I got a chance—to cross a snow-covered stretch of around 23 kilometres in Manang, a dream destination for all snow lovers.
I used to think that Manang is a far cry from the plains where I was born and raised in. I only had heard about the hardship that people experience while travelling in the district beyond the mountains. But my experience this time was a different story. The beauty that this place offers compensates the ordeals that you need to go through.
As we left Kathmandu in the morning, we reached the district headquarters Chame in the evening. Then we trekked to Humde, our final destination, on the second day. Sporadic snowfall forced us to halt our walk frequently.
We were travelling to participate in the second edition of Humde Ice Climbing Festival. Ice climbing was a major attraction for the tourists visiting Humde village in Ngisyang rural municipality-4 of the district. Around 40 persons, including Nepalis and foreigners, were participating in the event.
My first ice climbing experience was fun. At first, the steep hill scared me. As an ice climber, I was supposed to climb up 350 metres, steep uphill, and the entire route was covered in snow. However, I stepped forward, my confidence level also began to go up. A 160-metre uphill walk that I had done just before helped me acclimatise.
In the end, the trip proved to be one of the most memorable journeys that I had ever done in my life. The foreigners accompanying me commented that the place exactly looked like Switzerland. However, I was sad to notice that the government has failed to take benefits from such a mesmerising place.

At Lord Shiva’s abode: Kailash region in 5 photos,"Friday, February 21, 2020","In Hindu mythology, it’s widely believed that Kailash is the abode of Lord Shiva. It’s said that whoever takes a trip to Kailash is welcomed at the heavens after his death.
For those not on a pilgrimage, the trip still has plenty to offer. For one, the journey takes you through a myriad of landscapes, some of which are treacherous but are ultimately beautiful.

Simikot is the gateway to Kailash. This district headquarter of Humla is mainly accessed by air. After a half hour flight from Nepalgunj, you will reach Simikot from which the Kailash region is three days hike away.

Those not keen on religion can take a detour to Limi valley. A six day trek will take you to this region where local, through routine life, put up a fascinating display of culture.

Other routes to the region will take to you Lapcha Syar via Hilsa or alternately via Nyalo Pass (4950m). Be liberal with your time; this trek will take almost three weeks to complete.

For those on the trail to Kailash, it is worth noting that the trek will take to the other side of the border to Tibet. The unpredictability on the side of the Chinese authorities, in granting visas to tourists on their part, could make the trip unsuccessful. If that is the case, visitors can go to Lapcha Syar in Humla to see Kailash from the Nepal side.

Slugging it out on two wheels: the Langtang ride III,"Tuesday, February 18, 2020","(Read the first and second parts of the story.)
“Adventure never ends. There is a lot of adventures out there, waiting for us to live them!”
In Kyanjin Gompa village, a cluster of what looked like more than 30 blue-roofed houses—some as tall as four-storied, standing almost nose to nose in the sweeping valley, was not something the group had looked forward.   “Man, the place looks booming, it’s more like a town than a village,” said Diwash aloud.
And to round off the amazing sight, Mount Langtang Lirung, in all its grandeur, peered over the valley from the northern horizon while a row of snow-capped peaks rose and fell in a ripple from right to left. After checking into a guesthouse, the group strangely looked anything but tired. Maybe, it’d to do with their having made it to their destination without any hiccups.
Curiously, there seemed no fuss and bother about finding a hotel although they arrived late in the afternoon. They checked into a modest-looking Hotel Tibet on a street called Padma Marga with decent rooms and fair enough price, nothing to grumble about.
Celebration time
The dining room of the hotel wore a festive ambiance that evening. And what better way could there be for them to rejoice the moment than guzzle a bottle of beer and let off a hearty belch. The group restricted themselves to just a glass or two, though, because a bottle of beer up there was three times the price of Kathmandu.
Shishir went for a mug of sea buckthorn (tora in Tibetan and dale chuk in Nepali), instead, which cost him Rs 200.00. Sea buckthorn is a native wild bush that distributes in arid highlands of Nepal and produces orange-red berries that are said to have medicinal properties including cancer-fighting agents. I recall seeing those wild thorny shrubs during my cycling ride to Upper Mustang (chichi in Thakali dialect in Mustang and tora in Upper Mustang). Curiously, every single hotel in the Khumbu region (also Everest Region) has sea buckthorn juice on its menu.
The riders were not the only ones in the dining room, schmoozing about their victory. Small groups of foreign trekkers huddled together, talking animatedly. It seemed the crowds in the hall were revelling in their triumph as if they had won a soccer match.
Relaxed, everyone wished, they spent at least two days, hanging around Kyanjin village, but they were running short of time as they had to get back to Kathmandu in three days.  Khashing told the team that they had just one day to spare.
“I think we should go to Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint, the best-bit or the icing on the cake for every trekker to Lantang Valley trek. It is situated at 4,773 m, northeast of Kyanjin Gompa, the highest elevation we’ll have done this far. What Kala Patthar is to Everest Base Camp, Kyanjin Ri is to the Langtang trek, the highest point the trekkers attempt,” Khashing proposed. “Yippee,” bellowed Diwash.
The trail was not rideable. And none fancied the idea of lugging the bike again for hours, as they had had enough of it. Anyways, they recalled those admonitory words of the military officer and decided to hike instead.
To Kyanjin Ri
The team started early after a hasty breakfast, as it would take almost four hours to the viewpoint, something like 1,000 m straight up from Kyanjin Gompa village. The group later admitted that it was worth spending one day on the round-hike to Kyanjin Ri as the high point afforded a mind-boggling view of soaring cliffs, sharp pinnacles, and by far the massive Langtang Range in a panoramic sweep with glaciers into the bargain.
As they climbed up the narrow trail for two hours something, it looked they had made it to the summit, which was marked by fluttering prayer flags. As it turned, they still had to do twice that distance to reach the top. It took them almost three and a half hours from Kyanjin village to crest the ridge.
Strangely, the rock-strewn cliff tapered sharply to look like a needle-point from a distance. The wind was pretty strong at the peak and nippy, too. Contrary to their expectation, the viewpoint was not isolated. Several foreign trekkers seemed busy enjoying the scenery around and clicking on their cameras hungrily. After a customary hi-hello and Namaste, the group also joined the bandwagon.
Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint
Everyone looked ecstatic once on the crest, and it seemed there was no time for small talk. Wide-eyed, the group ran their eyes around in a frenzy, some busy taking pictures, others selfies with their cell-phones, vying for the perfect shot. From the northwest, the entire face of Langtang Lirung seemed to gaze back at them. And at its base rested the awesome Langtang Lirung Glacier, with the lateral moraines covered by thick debris.
At a closer look, the glaciers seemed to separate the lofty peaks, the likes of the Changbu Himal (6,251 m), Yuba (6,264 m), and to the northeast, the Yalla Peak (5,500 m).To the southwest, Tsergo Ri Peak stood conspicuous. The Tsergo Ri also offers another challenging climb for the trekkers. The South, across the valley, commanded the view of Naya Kanga (5,844 m).
The Langtang Range of mountains includes other prominent peaks such as Dorje Lakpa (6,966 m), Yubra Himal (6,035 m), Loenpo Gang (6,979 m), Kyunga Ri (6,601 m), Dogpache (6,562 m), Shelbachum (6,707), Langshisha Ri (6,427m), Ganchempo (6,387 m), and Jugal Himal (6,151 m), among many others. If you are hung up on viewing the Himalayan Range with a minimum of time spent on traveling, Langtang should go into your bucket list as it is the closest to Kathmandu Valley.
Shishir tried to locate the Ganjala Pass but failed. He had called off his plan to trek to Ganjala Pass, almost three days from Kyanjin Gompa. The reason was simple; he was not adequately outfitted and lacked the essentials needed for the trek.
He regretted having taken the matter lightly when he first planned the trek to the pass. The rest of the group could easily see his crestfallen face. “Don’t worry, Shishir. There is always a next time,” consoled Diwash, but that did not seem to amuse him. Little surprise, though, if you hear about Shishir, trail-blazing it, solo, to the Ganjala Pass, nay beyond, no sooner the trip was over.
End of journey
The group made a hasty retreat back to Kyanjin Gompa to make it before dark. Nobody fancied stumbling in the dark on that treacherous path.  Everyone looked worn-down and sad that they had to leave, the very next day. “Ke garne,” (what to do), as they say it in Nepali.

Fond memories
All good things must come to an end, as they say. For the team, only haunting memories lingered to take back home. But, everyone enjoyed it hands down, hardships aside. It seemed the group not only enjoyed the ride braving the challenging terrain but felt blessed with happy and hilarious times, too. Let’s share those priceless moments the group enjoyed.
On their way back to Lama Hotel, a local guy watched Anamica and Rojisha walking their bikes down on the stone stairs (he’d missed out on Khashing and Diwash riding down the steps). He sounded contemptuous and sneering when he addressed the group, “Is that how you came back from Kyanjin Gompa, walking and pushing your bikes?” Outraged, Khashing and Diwash pushed their bikes up the stairs (some 200 of them) and came hurtling down, riding. That demo, eventually, made the local bloke’s trap shut.
At the Langtang village’s relocated site, Khashing and Diwash suddenly stopped their bikes as they heard a yelling from Anamica followed by hooting and high-pitched wolf-whistling. As it turned out, she was startled by a mule that suddenly seemed to appear from nowhere on the track before her.
The local blokes were, in fact, not directing their jeering at her, but trying to shoo the ‘beast of burden’ away. It made Khashing and Diwash slap their sides and double over with laughter. But seeing Anamica and Rojisha on bicycles, on the entire trail, did make the locals stop in their track open-mouthed, surprised, and amused.
At Mundu, tired of eating dal-bhat, Anamica craved for something to tickle her tastebuds. When they stopped for tea, she suddenly saw WaiWai noodles on display in the shop. Her mouth watered, as she recalled, her days at school when she used to devour an entire packet dry, by crushing it and spicing it with the condiments that came with the noodles.
Anamica asked the small girl at the teashop about the price. Rupees fifty, she said. She asked for a packet, and without a second thought, tore it open. Scarcely had she crumpled up the packet than the girl who’d gone to confirm the price with her mom busy washing clothes came running back, and said, it was Rs 200.00 and not Rs 50.00.
Rojisha, too, gathered some fond memories to cherish back home. In Khangshyap, she was approached by a young boy who asked her to let him ride her bike. The 13-year-old boy seemed to ride well, although the bike was way too big for him.  His excitement was something to watch as his ruddy face flushed a flaming red. She just adored those blessed moments.
On their way back to Shyaphru Besi, Rojisha had another exciting time. While pedalling across a wooded stretch, she had to stop as a pair of barking deer stood smack-dab in the middle of the track, some 10 yards away. The beautiful animals with their shiny tan-coat looked at her, and did not spook, just casually crossed the track, and entered the nearby brush.
Lo and behold, moments later, as Diwash arrived from behind, they reappeared, looked at them for a few seconds, and then sauntered back into the woods. “I’d never seen deer in the wild before. It was not like seeing them in the zoo with their dusty coat and frail sickly look. They, on the contrary, looked so full of life,” Rojisha sounded very excited when she said that.
Another remarkable thing about the trip was that Shishir made sure they did not litter the place, every time they stopped. It looked that bordered a little on obsession as he picked up the filth like tobacco wrappers, plastic bags, and the like thrown around by others.
On their way back, the gang stopped to rest and sip water from their bottles by the track, a little further from Sherpa Gaun.  Rojisha was sitting on the left while the rest were sprawled out on the right. Suddenly, Rojisha rummaged out three packets of biscuits from her backpack and, to her bemused buddies, started gorging on them. It appeared she was not eating but stuffing herself. Before long, she had two packets devoured. She handed over the only packet left to her befuddled buddies.
“When we stopped to rest, I happened to look ahead and saw the steep hill in the distance, which made me so overwhelmed that I suddenly felt faint from hunger. Blocked-off from the view of the steep hill from their side, the rest of my partners were watching me curiously,” Rojisha burst into a peal of laughter as she shared the funny incident with me.
No sooner the group rose to their feet and prepared to hit the trail than they knew why Rojisha had acted that way. The group poked fun at her the rest of the way to Shyaphru Besi. And the journey ended, on that feeling-good upbeat note.
The skipper
Khashing, the skipper, seemed happy to answer my question when I asked him about the trip. “It was one of my toughest rides ever since we did a track that was meant exclusively for trekking.  I was weighed down not only by a hefty backpack (almost 11 kg) but the primary responsibility of the ladies too, rested heavy on my mind,” admitted Khashing to me.
The team leader then went on to relate one funnier incident. “On our way back from Kyanjin Ri, Diwash asked me to pose for a shot and took the camera. I chose a huge boulder and stood on it for the shot. Rojisha joined me and sat on her haunches next to me. She folded her legs and stretched her arms out into a meditative ‘janana mudra.’
“I don’t know what got into me that I leaped into the air in a flash, and in mid-air folded my legs and then my hands into a Namaste. Luckily, I landed safely on my feet.” A group of foreign trekkers watched the stupid act, dumbstruck.
“Later,” he continued, “I realised my mistake for having done that dumb prank because right behind, the boulder fell to a sheer drop, hundreds of metres down. In hindsight, though, I think the act put a lot of spice, or ‘oomph’ into the photo, didn’t it?” he finished with a sheepish smile.
For Rojisha and Anamica, it was an epic journey on wheels, but it looked that was just the beginning. “There was never a moment, I felt like giving up, or regretted going on the trip,” said Anamica, sharing her feelings with me. It appeared there was no looking back for both the ladies as they told me they would soon love to hit the trail again, no matter how tough.
“Adventure never ends. There is a lot of adventures out there, waiting for us to live them!”
Appeal:  *Do not litter, let’s keep our natural environment clean.
*When inside a national park, respect and obey the park rules.
Caveat:   *Always wear a helmet when riding your mountain bike.
* Ride safe. Do not try to prove yourself on technically extreme tracks.

Olangchung Gola can be your next trekking destination. Here’s why,"Tuesday, February 11, 2020","Travelling is both a profession and a passion for me. Mostly I travel to make a living, but almost every winter, I travel to new places on my own. For such occasions, I choose places that are rich in terms of natural beauty.
As a guide for foreign trekkers, I travel in western Nepal. When there are not many trekkers in the country, I take leave and go on vacation. This time I chose Olangchung Gola, a remote village in northeastern Nepal. Arguably, a very few foreigners and Nepalis have been there as trekkers. I prefer visiting rarely-visited places on my own so that I can lead my clients there in the next season.
—
I left Kathmandu in a foggy, cold February morning. Bikram Angdembe was accompanying me for the 20-day trip.
Olangchung Gola was not a strange place for me; I had heard about it many times. Of late, the village is associated with Nepali ophthalmologist Dr Sanduk Ruit, who was born in this tiny village 65 years ago. However, since I had never got a chance to see the place with my own eyes, I was excited about the journey.
We went there via Guphapokhari before we realised that the way via Phungling Bajaar could have been an easier route. You can take a flight from Kathmandu to Suketar of Taplejung district. There is also a road link for budget tourists.
There are two options to travel to Olangchung Gola from Phungling: trek for the entire route or hire a jeep till the halfway. If you hire the jeep, it can take you to Tapethok in the next five hours. You do not have any option except walking there onwards.
From Tapethok, walk for around two hours and have lunch at Lelep. This place is historically significant as two kings, belonging to Magar and Bhote communities, had fought a war here in the past. The Bhote king won the battle, but he also began to host a special ceremony two times a year in the respect of his opponent. The locals say the tradition still exists.
After a breather there, resume your walk. In the next four hours, you reach Ila Danda. Perhaps Ila Danda is the best option for you to stay overnight for Olangchung Gola is still far away.
Wake up early the next morning and walk for seven hours before you reach your final destination. The seven-hour walk can scare you, but you feel relief when you can find yourself in front of the mesmerising scenery. On the way, there are many waterfalls and monasteries. This route is a perfect place to get a closeup view of the third highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga (8,586 m) among other mountains of Nepal and India.
After reaching Olangchung Gola, I found that whatever I had heard about this place was not on a par with the level of beauty this place offers you. The houses in this small village are very much close to each other. The giant hills covered with silvery snow give the place a perfect backdrop.

Slugging it out on two wheels: the Langtang ride II,"Sunday, February 9, 2020","(Read the first part of the story.)
At daybreak, the burgeoning Sherpa Gaun (2,563m) looked like in the making of a miniature town. Blue corrugated zinc-roofed houses seemed to replace the once slate-roofed hamlet. And, as the village turned into a frequent stopover for the Langtang Valley trekkers, the place seemed marked by much life and activity.
After a hearty breakfast, the bikers prepared themselves to hit the trail. “First thing first, give your bikes a once-over. You have to care for them, too,” the skipper, Khashing Rai, barked out. The group hastened to dust their bikes, check the brakes and lightly lube the chains.
Everybody was ready for newer challenges, for all that their muscles ached and their limbs groaned with the last two days’ ride. After something like two hours on the trail, riding and pushing, the team leader asked the team to take a short break. “Guys, now prepare yourself for the worse—the toughest section of our trip as it will bear lugging for the most part—so full steam ahead,” summoned the team leader. “Aye, aye, Sir,” Shishir quipped and gave the Cub Scout salute.
Diwash, on the other hand, looked daggers at Khashing. He did not expect the trail to be that gruelling. Nobody did. But everyone was duly drilled that the track was trekking and not a cycling route.  “I almost felt like bashing him up at that moment,” lamented Diwash mock-seriously to me during our brief meet for the story.
The track first intervened daunting cliffs, once said to have trodden by the mule trains. Needless to say that one look at the sheer drops gave you the creeps. One false move could prove fatal. Shishir bravely acted like the Good Samaritan and assisted the lady riders. Anamica and Rojisha, though, kept their aplomb despite the punishing progress.
To Thangshyap
A little after the ordeal, the group arrived at a small hamlet called Rimche and stopped for a breather, their lungs bursting at the seams. After something like a half-an-hour, they reached Lama Hotel. Curiously, the small settlement previously named Changtang came to be called Lama Hotel when the route became popular, and the first-ever hotel offering food and accommodation to the weary trekkers happened to be the Lama Hotel. And the name stayed that way. Several lodges and teahouses huddled together in a cluster.
After a deserving tea-break at Rimche, the riders stopped for lunch at a place called Riverside, a small bunch of hamlets close to the Langtang Khola. Everybody looked spent. Little did they know that the forthcoming course until Purano Ghoda Tabela involved mostly lugging the bike on stone steps, going up and down.
Again the lady bikers proved their mettle and did equally well lugging their bikes (a normal mountain bike weighs from 14 to 16 kilos) alongside their male counterparts. In between brief rests, the team continued, but the riders were making very slow progress. As the day wore off, Khashing realised that it would be quite dark by the time they made it to Thangshyap, and the guesthouses might run out of rooms.
Shishir came to the rescue and volunteered to fast-track it to Thangshyap following short-cuts.  He was in Thangshyap in time to book the rooms for the night in the Potala Guesthouse. The name sounded very familiar. Then he recalled a guesthouse with that name at Thamel.
The shadows lengthened as the group kept lugging their bikes. Darkness fell when they finally arrived at Thangshyap, covering 12 km that day.  After supper, everyone hopped into bed early, obviously drained but with the comforting feeling that their final destination lay just 10 kilometres away.  They could not wait for the first call of the rooster at the crack of dawn.
Day Four saw the riders hit the trail after an early breakfast—their last day to their destination, Kyanjin Gompa, 10 km away.  As the trekking season had begun, the group kept bumping into foreign trekkers—Canadians, Aussies, Germans, South Africans, Malaysians, you name it. One group, what looked like a whole contingent (almost 20 of them) of South Koreans, even stopped to talk with them. It turned out they belonged to an alpine club back home.
Were they surprised to see the riders on the trail? ‘Stunned’ would be the right word as they had not the least bit expected to see mountain bikers on that dangerous trail. What’s more, their jaws dropped when they saw Anamica and Rojisha rubbing shoulders with their male peers.
A little later, they ran into a squad of armed military personnel, who gave them a good dressing-down for recklessly attempting the trail on their bikes. The army guys were doing a routine patrol, keeping a vigil on illegal hunting. They thought the cycling group was nothing but insane. They were beefing about the extra responsibility of rescuing that could weigh upon them should something go wrong. “Just be extra careful,” cautioned the commanding officer. That had a sobering effect on the team.
Old Lantang Village site
Despite three days on the trail, the riders were dying for the view of the great Langtang Range with the towering snow-clad peaks. So far, they only got flitting views of the peaks in the distance. The landscape seemed confined to the undulating craggy hills with lush forests, deep ravines, narrow gorges, and valleys—nevertheless, idyllic because they knew well that they would very soon miss out on them after getting back home.
As the group slogged ahead, they sighted a small Tamang teahouse community called the Gumba village. In another two hours, the riders arrived at the old Langtang Village (3,400 m), the historic disaster site of the April 2015 earthquake.
The morning of April 25, 2015, proved a doomsday for the ill-fated Langtang Village, which sat in a basin directly beneath the south face of the towering Langtang Lirung (7,227 m).  At 11:56 am that day, when the 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, a massive chunk of Mt Lantang Lirung, fell off bringing in its wake huge boulders and ice floes, almost emptying an entire lake, all crashing through a narrow gulley to slam into the small village.
Nothing but a pile of huge boulders, snow, and mud remained at the site. The massive avalanche took a heavy toll, and the thriving village, with nearly 55 lodges and several teahouses buried. More than 300 people perished with many unaccounted. The death toll included some foreign trekkers, guides, and porters, too.
The group stopped by the new Langtang Village, relocated some three hours above the earthquake-devastated site. “After almost four years since the earthquake, we are still struggling to reestablish ourselves in this new location,” said one elderly man from the village who had survived the quake. After the group left the new Langtang Village behind, suddenly, Khashing stopped, and his camera caught the first sight of the Langtang Lirung visible through a gap amidst trees.
The ride on the last day to Kyanjin Gompa seemed very slow, on account of the hard terrain and the elevation. “Guys, we stop for lunch at Mundu. From there, it’s like three more hours to Kyanjin,” informed Khashing. The group tagged along by Shishir arrived at Mundu a little past noon, right on time for lunch. It was after Mundu, the group was rewarded with the spectacular sights of the Himalayas.
It looked the snow-capped mountains were getting closer as they forged ahead towards Kyanjin. That and the comforting feeling that their final destination lay not far away made everyone excited and resuscitated. Diwash, a little withdrawn because of exhaustion, even fell into an animated chat with the rest of the team.
The rest of the trail brought the riders near and nearer to the towering Langtang range, punctuated by bare hills that rolled out as far as the eyes could see. The team took their time enjoying the panorama.
A little later, the group stopped to watch a herd of yaks grazing on a sloping meadow as a row of peaks soared behind. The bovines seemed to be on their own as no herder was on sight. The scene stole the heart of every rider, and they gawked at the scene, mesmerised.
Kyanjin Gompa
From there on, the group could not resist themselves from frequently stopping for a photo-shoot, or two. It looked, everyone was on a cavorting spree. Being that their destination was just an hour away, the riders took the liberty to indulge in a little time-killing on the virgin landscape. “Pure bliss,” called out Rojisha.
Khashing called out to the group to get going as they’d to make it in time to Kyanjin Gompa and find a lodge for the night. As the trekking season was in, the place might run short of accommodation. Spellbound by the beautiful sight, the riders seemed lulled into a trance and did not wish to make a move. Finally, they hopped onto their saddles. Another hour on the track finally brought the riders to the end of their journey, the Kyanjin Gompa Village.

Why visiting Muktinath during snowy winter can be a rewarding affair,"Thursday, February 6, 2020","
To visit Muktinath, a Hindu and Buddhist religious shrine in Mustang district of western Nepal, the autumn is considered the best season. The weather conditions during this season are perfect for walking around and sightseeing. I chose the same season for my trip in the past, but this time I wanted to experience something different.
I visited the trans-Himalayan district in December, the peak of the winter. The experience, however, was more rewarding as I saw the shrine snow-blanketed.

I had always wondered how snow-clad Muktinath would look like. I got the answer.
The tour began as December approached its end. My friend from Laprak, Gam Bahadur Gurung, and from Base Camp Trek, Sunil Shrestha fixed the date. I travelled as an interpreter as we were accompanying 12 journalists from France TV.

Muktinath needs no introduction. It is one of the most popular destinations, globally and locally. However, Jong, a nearby destination from Muktinath is not much heard of. We had planned to visit Jong this time.

We flew to Pokhara from Kathmandu and then hired a jeep to Jomsom. The next trip was up to Kagbeni on the jeep. The heavy snow meant we could not go further on the vehicle.

Therefore, we headed toward Jong on horses. The French team had come to film a documentary titled ‘Secret Path’.

The whole place was blanketed by snow. The Dhaulagiri Mountain looked astonishing from Jong village. The village is artistically and culturally rich. The gumbas around here are very old.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-visiting-muktinath-during-snowy-winter-can-be-a-rewarding-affair.html,travel
Slugging it out on two wheels: the Langtang ride I,"Monday, January 27, 2020","There is nothing like taking a holiday break, to escape the daily grind, the urban chaos, the stifling greenhouse gases, and to say the least to raise your spirits, down in the dumps. Some even like to inject a dose of adventure, too, into such escapades.
For some, it’s just plain sightseeing tours to new places, a pilgrimage or cities. But some are wired differently. Their reading of an adventure is to go off the beaten track, discover the wild and the wacky—something new, fresh, if not, the funkiest. Some even dare to push borders and boundaries.
I happened to know one such swashbuckling duo, Khashing Rai and Shishir Joshi. In 2018, they dared to redefine the concept of conventional trekking by walking bare feet for four consecutive days to Budhinandha Tal, far-west Nepal, Bajura (read the story) to an elevation of 4,600 m with nothing more than Wai Wai (noodles) and chiura (beaten rice) for food, and no warmth of a bed since the deserted trail had no teahouses or lodges. Brave? I thought they were raving mad.
Destination Langtang
In 2019, with the Dashain festival around the corner, the duo planned a trip, on wheels (mountain bikes), to the Langtang Valley, which also happens to be a popular trekking destination. Well, in other words, their destination was “the land of the ox.” In Tibetan dialect, ‘Lang’ stands for land, and ‘tang’ translates to an ox.
The valley is also well known for spectacular views of glaciers and needless to write, peerless pastoral beauty. They’d set their sights on Kyangjin Gompa (4,300 m), nestled at the footholds of the iconic peak, the Langtang Lirung. The trip this time did not sound far-out, but it was no picnic.
The gang
The monsoon had not fully dissipated as it came late last year, but that did not matter. The trip was set in stone. The duo this time was to be accompanied by an old compadre Diwash Pradhan and two lady friends,  Anamika Ghothane (Gurung) and Rojisha Limbu, both in their early twenties. Diwash and Khashing had done a ride with me to Upper Mustang in October 2018.
Anamica and Rojisha are registered nurses by profession. Although they have been riding their mountain bikes for the last four years, this was their first-ever tough ride on a gnarly terrain that included rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, steep slopes, and impossible inclines. What’s more, the trip included more than 40 percent lugging on extreme inclines, and steep gradients.
Khashing, as the team leader, had briefed every member of the team of the possible hardships and also warned them, especially the women, about the shouldering the bikes. Anamica and Rojisha appeared resolute. They did not even bat an eyelid when Khashing put in the bare facts. Tough as old boots, Shishir did not care. Diwash, not used to technical riding, seemed a little uncertain. “What of it, if the ladies can do it, why can’t I?” he mused.
As it turned out, Shishir changed his mind at the last hour. He said he’d trek instead. Very like him, always unpredictable. He wanted to explore further to the Gan Jala Pass (5,300 m). Coincidentally, the cycling route the group was doing from Syabru Besi to Kyanjin Gompa was the same. The route went further from the gompa to highlands like Tserko Ri and finally the Gan Jala Pass, a key trekking destination in the Langtang region.
Shishir decided he’d tag along with his cycling comrades on foot, help the ladies out on tough sections, and then part company after Kyanjin Gompa. Sounded very out of the ordinary, but not unlike Shishir, though. Catching up with the cyclists for him was a breeze as the terrain was virtually grueling uphill, and the push-and-carry made the ride nothing short of a snail-pace.
To Syabru Besi
After month-long planning, the group finally left for Syabru Besi (also Syaphru Besi) in the second week of September 2019. The trip was scheduled for a week. The buses to Shyabru Besi had changed the usual route from Jhor or Kakani to the Galchhi-Devighat highway (as both the old highways were in bad shape). The road after Galchhi (a point of Prithvi Highway), went along the Trishuli River to Nuwakot with Devighat en-route.
The scheduled buses shuttled the travellers from Machhapokhari, Balaju Bypass. For the first-timer, the bus park can be a nasty surprise to watch the chaotic fuss.
Khashing looked worried that the bumpy ride might ruin the bicycles loaded on the roof of the bus. It reminded him of the Upper Mustang trip mishap when one of the bicycles had a tyre slashed open by some sharp object on the bus-roof.


He made it a point to keep checking as the bus stopped at Thade Dhunche, and Thulo Barkhu until they finally arrived at the kick-off point of their trip, Syabru Besi (2,380 m), Rasuwa district.
Layover
As the small but busy town nestled at the base of soaring hills on three sides, the Bhote Koshi tumbled down by its side, making quite a rumble. Mostly hotels and teashops lined the main bazaar. To their surprise, the crowd happened to include more backpack toting foreign tourists, milling around the street, than the locals. After checking into a roadside lodge and a little refreshment, the gang took a stroll along the street.

By and by,  at a  tea stall, over a cup of tea, they overheard a fellow talking about a hot spring very close to the lodge, they’d put up. They decided to have a look-see.  It took them hardly a half-an-hour to get to the spot, located at the confluence of the Langtang Khola and the Bhote Koshi. But nobody relished the idea of taking a dip as the water looked sullied.

To Sherpa Gaun
After a layover at the lodge, the group warmed up for the ride the next morning. The destination for the day was Sherpa Gaun, nine kilometres away. Yes, everybody looked excited, Anamica and Rojisha the most. They just could not wait to hop on to their saddles. If Khashing appeared engrossed as the skipper, Diwash seemed a little apprehensive. Shishir remained cool as a cucumber. He gave the ladies a tip or two about the proper handling of the bike on rough trails.
As it turned out, the dirt track was not easy sailing. A recent landslip seemed to have strewn the track with rocky debris.
It was time to stop for breakfast. The group chose a teahouse by the bank of the Langtang River.  As the turquoise water tumbled south over rocks and boulders creating white feathers, the fast current formed foam-lipped eddies near the banks. The opposite bank rose to lush towering hills.
So far, so good. No hitch-ups, up until then. Everybody did their best. Shishir did well to keep pace on foot. The lunch was scheduled for Khangjim. After a filling breakfast, a little breather, and having feasted on the pristine landscape, the group stretched themselves up to hop onto their saddles.
After breaking a sweat for something like three hours, they sighted a small habitation, the pit stop for lunch. “That’s Khangjim,” announced Khashing. Time for lunch. Everybody went for the cherished dal-bhat. That reminds me of my 12-day cycling tour to the Upper Mustang when the all-time favourite for our group for lunch was dal-bhat, each day, hands down. Dal-bhat was a reasonable Rs 150.00 (veg). Non-veg was Rs 200.00. “The charges here for lunch is much cheaper than what we paid in Mustang, guys,” commented Diwash, looking a little surprised.
After a brief respite, the group was all set to spin. “On to Sherpa Gaun, our stopover for the day, guys,” called out Khashing. The expected time of arrival at Sherpa Gaun was nearly three hours away. Most of the tracks were rideable but going uphill. The lush vegetation gradually was being replaced by bare hills and scrubland as they gained elevation. The weather remained clear and the air cool with a hint of chill.
Flora and fauna
Langtang National Park is known for a rich and biodiverse flora and fauna. It records more than 1,000 species of vegetation with quite a number of endemic ones. To name a few, the forest is home to sal (Shorea robusta), chirpine ((Pinus roxburghii), Nepalese alder, silver fir, hemlock, and the most common rhododendron. An abundance of birch in Kyangjin, pines in Thulo Syabru and rhododendron mixed forest at Thadepati are noteworthy. The vegetation gradually shifts with the change in the altitude.
The park is equally rich in fauna such as musk deer, Himalayan tahr, Himalayan black bear, serow, the elusive snow leopard (still at a risk status), and, by far, the endangered, red panda. The park is also home to more than 250 species of birds including the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), the national bird of Nepal, and satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra).
Sherpa Gaun
After pedaling close to three hours on the hill section with a little pushing and occasional carrying on the rocky track, the group arrived at Sherpa Gaun (2,500 m). Surprisingly, Anamica and Rojisha both kept pace with their male partners. Dead beat, the group checked into a lodge for the night. Room tariff again was modestly priced, just Rs 300.00.
Less than a couple of decades ago, Sherpa Gaun was just a scattered hamlet on the hillside, so common about our far-flung regions, living on agriculture—growing potatoes, corn, wheat and barley and doing cattle farming—rearing cows, chickens, goats, sheep including mules and yaks.
Most of the residents of the village are said to have migrated from Tibet, some 600 years ago.  The border is close to the village. By and large, the residents of the village follow Buddhism. The name, Sherpa Gaun, sounds something like a misnomer, considering the predominance of the Tamang community.
The pastoral scenario gradually changed as Sherpa Gaun became a regular stopover for the trekkers doing the Langtang Valley trek. The locals, besides their farming, supplemented their earnings by running lodges and teahouses.

The ancient trail to Kalinchok: Memoir II,"Wednesday, January 15, 2020","
The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense, and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
For me, the night at the three-tiered cavern in Kuri proved a fitful one. The ground floor had hollowed out enclaves, but the upper landing, where we were bedded down, was open with a huge flat rock, almost measuring the size of a house, precariously balanced in a 40-degree angle over us. It served as the roof.
My imagination seemed to run amuck. I feared that the huge rock overhead might, any time, crash down and turn us into a human sandwich. Although we had the logs blazing, it was bitterly cold.
Yeti
We got up early the next morning so that we could do the final ascent to Kalinchok located on a towering bluff. It was still dark at six in the morning. While we sipped scalding hot coffee, one of our group, the village bloke, left for the shrubs to relieve himself.
Barely had we finished half of our coffee than we heard a yelling that came from the direction the fellow had gone. Soon, we heard foot-falls and there he was in the half-light of dawn bounding towards us as if there seemed no tomorrow for him. We watched dumbstruck.
His face was an open book. He was panting and shaking, mumbling something incoherently. One of his hands still held his unfastened trousers. He kept on repeating “khyak, khyak, I saw a khyak.” Khyak stands for an apparition.
“Are you sure you saw it? What did it look like,” asked my uncle? He recovered his breath, paused a little, and then blurted it out, “it was eight to nine feet tall, hairy and with blood-shot eyes that bore into me.”
My pulse seemed to race like mad when the fellow gave the portrayal. The description he gave pieced together (as reported by the media then) like the Yeti, the Abominable Snowman—the ‘mysterious hominoid’. News about the Yeti often made the headlines worldwide those days. I started fantasizing about my name making it big in Time magazine with the cover story, “Yeti eventually photographed by a Nepali boy.” The feature-story would also carry my photograph. Oh Boy, that will make me a celebrity,” I mused excitedly.
Boyhood fantasy
We asked the fellow to lead us there. He balked first but yielded reluctantly, though. I grabbed my camera, and we all dashed to the spot. When we arrived at the place, the first light of dawn had broken in with the visibility fair.
I was carrying my dad’s Rolleiflex box camera, considered to be high-end in those days. The funny thing about the camera was that you had to peer down into a screen after flipping open the top cover and not look through the viewfinder at the subject like in modern-day ones. The Rolleiflex box camera is considered an antique today.
The fellow stealthily approached the spot where he supposedly saw the ‘khyak’. We crept behind. I’d my camera at the ready. But for the thick hedge and scrub, we saw nothing. We looked around but with no results. The castle I’d built in the air came crashing down. So much for my dream about the Yeti!
Looking back, it was nothing but my boyhood fantasy. Later, after we were back home in Dolakha, my uncle told me that the poor fellow fell sick and recovered only after he consulted a shaman and sacrificed a stout rooster at the Bhimeswor temple.
Highland
We left the cavern in the first light and began our climb. I was overawed to see the twin-crested butte that loomed above us in the north, which, my uncle announced, was our destination, the Kalinchok shrine. The narrow trail seemed perilous as it fell on its side into sheer drops. One false step could but prove fatal.
I was surprised to find my breathing a tad laborious. “That’s because we have crossed the 10,000 feet mark, and this happens to be your first ever hike to so high an elevation,” my uncle explained. I hastened to gulp down a mouthful of sattu and pop in a pod of the raw garlic my grandma had stashed into my bag. After something like an hour, we arrived at a fork.
One path led straight across while the other went up on a narrow incline with stairs dug into the earth. “That’s the exit path,” my cousin informed me, pointing to our right. “We are now close to the shrine, just 200 yards to go,” he enthused.
Within minutes we were climbing the final rungs of a rusted iron ladder. Unlike the later years, the rickety iron ladder had no hand-rails and wobbled too. It doubled as a bridge between the twin buttes. We had to tread cautiously as the gaping chasm that fell into a dark depth stared back at us frighteningly. In all honesty, with no head for heights, I was petrified.
The summit
Finally, we were at the crest of the narrow ridge. It took us close to two hours. It was kind of scary at that elevation as no handrails, introduced in the later years, secured the summit around. Neither did the paths, up the entire hike. The early morning thick fog at the top made the vibe eerier as the dark ravines on the sides looked threatening. It was cold, understood because we stood at 12, 605ft (3,842m).
A solitary slate-roofed two-story house stood on the former crest. The dilapidated condition and the barred doors and windows spoke of its abandoned status. “That was a living quarter for the pilgrims, but as it was in a rundown state, it is not used anymore, “my uncle informed me.
To my dismay, there was no such thing as a temple housing the idol of a Bhagwati or Kali on the main ridge. The flat clearing, barely measuring 200 square feet, had a legion of tridents of all sizes haphazardly stuck into the ground next to a shallow hollow pit. The pit bore a natural spring enclosed by a small pagoda-style temple a little less than my height (5’-4”).
The devotees offered puja at this pit. A horde of bells, big and small, festooned a pillar next to the temple. The devotees offer tridents to the deity to pay their homage. Some also tender bells. Several unidentifiable stone deities lined the center of the ridge. “It is said the holy water from the spring drains down into a similar pit at the Bhimeswor shrine in Dolakha,” my uncle explained. I listened overawed.

My jaws dropped as I looked around. The clock seemed to stop—a “temporal illusion”? I was thrilled to see the majestic Gauri Shankar unfold right before my eyes in the east, as it were, gazing intently at me. A wisp of cloud caressed the snowy tips making me almost jump in a bout of euphoria, given that, it was my first ever hike to such great heights and the rarest rendezvous with the mighty snow-clad peaks.
Peaks galore
Craggy peaks ran the show in the north with the likes of Choba Bhamaré (5,933 m), Langtang Lirung (7,227 m), Dorjee Lakpa (6,966m), Shisha Panga (8,013m), Jugal (6,070m), Manasalu (8,156m), Ganesh I(Yangra,7,422m), Amabamori, Namburi, and many more. The lush hills in the south unfolded into an uninterrupted chain. I just could not believe my eyes, every which way I looked. I could barely contain myself at seeing such unparalleled grandeur and biodiversity.
My cousin informed me that the Kalinchok crest at night time also afforded a view of Kathmandu Valley illuminated at night. I spotted a foot-trailway down northwest, which meandered past a ridge and disappeared. “That,” my uncle explained, “led to Kuti, a village in ancient Tibet. It used to serve long ago as a busy route frequented by ancient traders.” He further informed me, “If the west escarpment of Kalinchok is the source of the Sun Kosi River, the eastern slope gives birth to Tama Koshi. The two rivers meet at Sindhuli.”
After puja (worship) over and an hour at the crest, we decided to leave. As we began our descent, I sighted a gang of shy red-billed choughs sunbathing on a ledge call out. Maybe that was to warn us not to hang around at the shrine longer, I thought. I visited Kalinchok, several times in my later years, on foot and by motor transport. My last trip, in 2014, was on my mountain bike.


In all those 50 years, the scenario has undergone no end of changes. The sheer remoteness of the place, the raw unsullied environs, the element of suspense and adventure, the mystical identification with the entirety, and the absolute bliss of nature, missed out on all the later trips. None compared with my first. It was the ultimate and unparalleled—period.
Lost and forgotten
I wonder if the ancient trail to Kalinchok still exists today. The presence of chortens (stupas), cairns, and the stone steles engraved with Tibetan inscriptions commemorating the departed souls in the middle of nowhere. The deathly still Simpani with the picture-perfect emerald green heart-shaped pond hemmed in by the tall pines.
The sightings of the danfé ((Lophophorus impejanus), or the Impeyan monal on high ridges, basking in the early morning sun; the Yaks attended by cows (chouris) roaming freely on the wild meadows and the woods. The sweet, invigorating Chhang (sweet corn wine) after the grueling climb at Thangsa, the sautéed dried yak meat with farm-fresh milk and soft chhurpi at Gairi, served by those smiling Sherpa ladies, who did not want to be paid–all seem but fond memories, nay a dream.
To say the least, how can I fail to recall the soul-searching experience I’d at the Dharmadwar (holy entrance)? The local myth ran that, by the will of God, only the devout could squeeze through the narrow slit between two huge rocks that made the Dharmadwar. It was said, the sinners always failed, no matter their size. I feel like guffawing today when I recall the incident. Even though I was a scrawny fellow then, my heart pounded when I underwent the trial (ordeal?).
Looking back, every wonderful moment I spent on the great wilderness trodding on the ancient trail to Kalinchok, as a youngster, seems a figment of my imagination—lost to the sands of time. Curiously, though, after 50 years yet, they still haunt my memories with a smack of nostalgia to this day.

The ancient trail to Kalinchok: Memoir I,"Monday, January 6, 2020","I journeyed to Kalinchok several times but none compared with the one I did the first time, which, today, has become little short of a memoir.
Consecrated to Goddess Bhagwati Kali, Kalinchok, the Hindu shrine nestles on a soaring bluff 12, 605ft (3,842m) above the sea level. Regarded a holy pilgrimage, the deity hugs a narrow ridge that sharply falls to deep ravines. Lush rolling hills punctuate the southern horizon in an unbroken chain as far as the eyes can travel.
If the north skyline parades an array of snow-capped peaks, the east on the other, towers with the sacred twin-peaked the Gaurishankar (7,134m) and the Melungtse Himal (7,181m).
The early days
Some half a century ago, Kalinchok seemed off-limits to the rest of Nepal. Just the locals of Dolakha, Charikot, and people from nearby villages visited the highland destination to pay their homage. The reason was not far to seek—lack of communication—roads. Dolakha and Charikot were not accessible by road and still fell short of electricity then.
Further, during those days, the foot-trail from Charikot to Kalinchok was no picnic. The narrow trail cut through rugged terrain and climbed steeply for hours on end. The paths were narrow, slippery, and without footholds at no end of places. The switchbacks that cut through the thick forest often vanished into overgrown shrubs. More often than not, people lost their way.
Only clusters of tiny villages lay in the first half of the journey, the rest of the route remained virtually deserted, harsh, cold and unrelenting—nay near frightening. The highlands bore only a handful of shacks belonging to the Sherpa community.
The weather, too, in those heights took a nasty shift at times, and even months like February and March caught hailstones the size of golf balls. At such times, the pilgrims had to face grave danger, as an adequate shelter was difficult to find. What’s more, local gossips ran high that wayfarers were often looted in the dense forest that intercepted the trail.
Arrival of roads
With the arrival of the Swiss-engineered Lamosanghu-Jiri Road (Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg) in 1985, connecting Charikot and later the dirt road from Charikot to Kuri in 2005, the destination gradually drew more visitors from far and wide including Kathmandu. Most comprised of pilgrims. Others included adventure lovers and odd foreign tourists.
Charikot, 133km northeast of Kathmandu can be reached today by bus. To access the burgeoning town of Charikot, the first leg of the journey takes a four-hour bus ride on the Arniko Highway to Khadi Chaur, Lamo Sanghu. The highway there meets a fork that, after crossing a steel bridge over the Bhote Koshi, follows a narrower feeder road on the right (road to Jiri or Pasang Lhamu Rajmarg), which goes to Charikot. From Khadi Chaur, it takes another two hours to Charikot.
From Charikot, it’s like 18km to Kuri. You can either hire or share with others a Bolero jeep. After Kuri, it’s a one and a half-hour walk up a steep hill with stone steps to climb. A year ago, a cable-car service opened to shuttle the pilgrims to Kalinchok from Kuri.
Shrouded in mystery
For ages, village folklore and myths abounded the Kalinchok shrine. A mere mention of the deity evoked emotions of awe, dread, and reverence among the native inhabitants of the hill-town Dolakha and nearby villages.
I still recall the words of my mother, a nonagenarian, aged 94 today, when I visited Kalinchok the first time. That was almost 48 years ago. “You better keep those things on your mind. First, do not attempt the shrine the wrong way. There are two approaches—one to gain admittance and the other to exit. The exit comes first but skip that and go a little further to follow the path that climbs to a steel footbridge.”
“Do not,” she continued, “hang around long after the puja. The shrine is visited by all kinds of spirits, some good others evil. Last but not least, do not at any cost return to the shrine after you exit the flight of steps down. You will meet with dire consequences if you do that,” she finished with an admonishing wave of her hand.
She went on to relate the incident when a local villager, disregarding the local belief, went back to collect something he’d left at the deity site. The fellow threw up blood and died after he was back home. That tale gave me the goosebumps.
The old days
I was a strapping youngster, just through with his SLC exams and a freshman at college, when I did my first hike to Kalinchok. I must have been 18 years old then (I’m 67 now). I was visiting my ancestral home in Dolakha for the first time with an uncle. The present Pasang Lhamu Highway was not built at the time. First, I travelled by bus on the Arniko Highway to a roadside town called Barhabishe, located at the banks of the Bhote Koshi River.
From Barhabise, the onwards journey to Dolakha began on foot, a gruelling hike that took a day and a half. The trail traversed across several villages but mostly forested areas crossed our path. We barely ran into wayfarers as the trail seemed deserted with no sign of habitation. We met people only when we neared small settlements.
There were no lodges and teahouses all along the route at the time. So, we had to spend the night in a village. For accommodation, we approached the nearest house and asked the owner. Amusingly, meals for the night depended largely on the owner’s hospitality.
After a day and one night on the trail, we finally arrived at Charikot at around 10 in the morning. “We’re almost home, it’s just four and a half kilometers from here,” announced my uncle. I could not wait to see my hometown.
Dolakha
Unlike Charikot, which happened to be just a cluster of thatched hamlets scattered around the hillside, Dolakha looked flourishing. The village, though small, boasted several shops and a school. As cobbled paths crisscrossed the town, stone spigots seemed to be located on every street. What struck me the most was the presence of Hindu temples and monuments in quite a number. I even saw a Buddhist stupa into the bargain.
I further learned that Dolakha served once as a flourishing Kingdom ruled by the Malla Kings. Little wonder, the modest little village seemed steeped in rich culture and history. The jewel in the crown, the Bhimeswor Shrine, the most revered deity of the Dolakhes, was regarded as the pride and glory of Dolakha. Its fame traveled far and wide and drew devotees by the thousands.
The local people of Dolakha claim that the stone deity at the Bhimeswor shrine perspires preceding any grave national catastrophe befalling the country. Despite repeated wiping, beads of sweat kept trickling down the stone effigy of Bhimeswor prior to the following: the devastating earthquake of 1934 (2007 B.S.), the demise of Panchayat government in 1990, the Royal carnage of June 1, 2001, at the Naryanhity Palace, to cite a few.
The ancient trail
After a few days stay at my ancestral home in Dolakha, we were all set to begin the trek, the trail trodden by my ancestors. My anxious grandma hastened to shove into my bag pods of raw garlic and sattu (finely-ground dry-roasted corn), urging me to munch on them when reaching the uplands. “That works against ‘lekh-lagné,” she said.
Lekh lagné translates to altitude sickness. Eating raw garlic and sattu when going to the highlands was a common practice in Dolakha. We hit the trail with my uncle, a cousin from Dolakha, and one village bloke. The first leg of the journey was to Charikot, four and a half kilometers west of Dolakha.
Farming and rearing goats and chickens seemed the distinguishing feature of the village. As we left the settlements behind, the trail led uphill through patches of terraced fields with rice, millet, and mustard. The rice fields were green with tender stalks, waist-high. Other patches had flowering mustard. The hillside seemed to stand out amidst the contrasting colours.

Groves of bamboo along the trails were a common sight. Over our shoulders to the south, we could see the receding Charikot drop steeply into unbroken terraces of lush rice fields cascading down to the Tama Koshi River that wound its way across a deep gorge.
After we passed by a cluster of thatched huts at a village called Chhotang, the landscape took a shift. The trail wound up with occasional settlements that crossed our path, but gradually dropped in number as it led across uninhabited terrain and lush woods.
As I laboured on the trail on the inclines, my city mind strayed to the thought that our far-off country locales could be so quiet and remote. The dense cover we intercepted held, temperate to sub-alpine mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, largely blue pine, hemlock, oak, and the ubiquitous rhododendron( Laligurans) and Chimal (white rhododendron).


The inimitable Sherpas
After a few hours on the remote uphill, we were relieved to see some sign of life. It was a small Sherpa hamlet called Gairi Gaon (2,450m). It consisted of just three shacks. If the north commanded a panoply of peaks in the distance, the mighty-looking Gauri Shankar stood right before our eyes in the east. There was a considerable chill in the weather.
The smiling Sherpas were very generous and offered us something to eat. The food included dried yak meat, boiled potatoes (their staple), and the local delicacy, chhurpi (hard cheese made from yak-cow or Chauri milk). Freshly made and soft, the cheese was very appetizing.
The Sherpa ladies were reluctant to accept the money my uncle offered for their hospitality but accepted coyly as we insisted. After Gairi, the higher we climbed, the outback seemed further isolated and wilder.
“After Gairi, the trail will be isolated all the way, no habitation, nothing to eat. So, expect nothing,” my uncle said with a smile. Very young as I was, and had never traveled out of the Valley, every moment, since I started for my ancestral home, was a one of its kind. When we stopped for brief respites, I munched on the dry-roasted soybean and maize my grandma had wrapped in a piece of rag and stowed into my bag. It surely worked when I felt the pangs of hunger.
The more we climbed, the harder the trail got as dense shrubs seemed to come in the way. Some even stung as they had sharp spikes. Many a time, I could not help feeling that we were lost. As we climbed further, the pristine backwoods teemed with tall pines in thick rows, which seemed to reach for the skies. No mortals around. Total serenity, complete solitude! Sheer bliss!
In one of my later hikes more than two decades later, the same stretch of the jungle was, to my horror, strewn with logs, many freshly felled, and the old left to decay. It looked the unscrupulous loggers had gone on a rampage. Some of the stumps measured close to three feet in girth. Later, I learned that they were more than 100 years old. All I could do was shake my head helplessly.
Kuri
As we slogged up a small clearing, it seemed the excruciating climb had finally ended. The spot was called the Ganesh Twapper. The trail descended into a small valley. “That,” announced my beaming cousin, “is Kuri, our stop-over for the night.” Darkness fell when we stopped at Kuri.
The meadows were bare of trees. In total darkness, we took shelter for the night in a cave called the teen-tallé-odar (literally a three-tiered cavern). As my uncle and others set about to prepare the evening meal, I lay down spent and starving.
We had to bear everything from home–rice, dal (pulse), vegetables, tea, and needless to say, the pots and pans for cooking. For cooking, we foraged for firewood. At night-time, we found dead logs to burn to fight off the cold. The village bloke had to go quite a distance to fetch them.
Even in early November, the temperature seemed to drop down to below zero at Kuri. For four months, the trail remained closed due to heavy snowfall. “The Sherpas from Gairi, Chothang, and Kuri relocate their dwellings and Yak goths (sheds) to lower climes before the onset of snow each winter,” my uncle explained. He had walked that trail to Kalinchok several times.

The ‘gunfire’ pond: Why you should visit Timbung Pokhari in eastern Nepal,"Thursday, December 26, 2019","
Four days away from Kathmandu lies Timbung Pokhari, a religious pond at an elevation of 4335 m. The pond borders Taplejung’s Sindingwa Rural Municipality and Panchthar’s Yangwarak Rural Municipality.
The name ‘Timbung Pokhari’ originated from a Limbu word ‘Timbak’, which means the firing of a gun. The locals gave the pond this name as the pond often makes a sound that is similar to that of gunfire.

Majestic views of Kanchenjunga can be seen close to the pond which is 466 m in length and 154 m in width.
Even though the pond is covered in snow for six months every year, hosts of pilgrims have been visiting this pond to offer puja for a few centuries now. Pilgrims gather around the pond, especially during the month of Shrawan (July-August) and during festivals like Janai Purnima and Nag Panchami.

It is believed that by offering a puja in this pure pond, wishes of pilgrims come true along with their lives being filled with peace and happiness. But the locals also believe that bad things happen to the visitors if they have sin, greed and jealousy on their conscience.

The locals believe that the magpies around the area clean the pond on a regular basis. They also add that things that are in the pond or are being offered to the pond shouldn’t be taken away. Locals connect the death of 12 foreigners recently with the myth.

The journey from Kathmandu to Timbung Pokhari can take up to four days. If you wish to spend a day at the pond, it will take a total of nine days.
It takes two days on foot to reach Timbung from Chyangthapu, the starting point of Mid-Hill Highway. Due to the unavailability of the road, the only way to reach the pond is walking.

People from different places from Nepal and other countries visit Timbung Pokhari. As the pond is quite close to India’s border, it sees a lot of Indian pilgrims throughout the year from places like Manipur, West Bengal and Sikkim.

The pond is both unique in natural beauty and biodiversity. The area around the pond is home to various rare flora and fauna and is also known as the capital of herbs. Valuable herbs like bikham, kutki, padmachal, jatamasi, panchaule and yarsagumba can be found in the area along with aromatic herbs like sunpati, bhairungpani and sikpale.

The place is also home to animals like Himalayan monal, Himalayan blue sheep, Himalayan goral, bear, snow leopard, musk deer, red panda and many more.
The best time to visit Timbung Pokhari is between March and October. Mid-July to August is even better to get there and witness the unique culture of the area.

Having seen its potential, the local government is now working at promoting the place hosting various fairs in the area. The pond has also been featured on the list of 100 new tourism destinations that the federal government published a few days ago.

Fantastic Phoksundo: A trip to Nepal’s pristine lake,"Tuesday, December 24, 2019","
Ever since I watched the movie Himalaya (also known as Caravan), I always wanted to go to Dolpa and visit Phoksundo Lake. Having planned this trip more than once, 2018 became the year when I finally got a chance to visit Nepal’s pristine lake.
Dolpa district is now accessible by road, but the easier way to get to the Phoksundo Lake is via air. That is why we took a flight from Nepalgunj to Juphal, from where we started our four-day trek towards the lake.
After the 35-minute flight, we started our trek to Dunai, descending through maize fields and local villages. We walked along the bank of Bheri River and reached Dunai after four hours.
The next day, we were headed to Chhepka. The six-hour trail descends through the streets of Dunai and crosses a bridge over Bheri River. After few kilometres, we reached Shey Phoksundo National Park check post.

From there, we ascended along the rock-strewn trail and trekked further through a series of hemp farms until we reached Kageni. Relishing the views of waterfalls and lush vegetation, we made our way through the tropical forests to reach our overnight stop: Chhepka.
The next overnight stop from Chhepka was the Jharana Hotel which was around six hours away. Ascending through a forested path filled with big cedar trees, we climbed up through wide meadows situated above the gorge of Phoksundo River, from where we get a great view of a high waterfall and a faraway view of Phoksundo Lake.
The five-hour journey from Jharana Hotel to the lake descended steeply through forests filled with birch trees to the upper reaches of the Phoksundo Khola, from where we trekked through the shores of the lake.

My dream of coming to the lake had come true. What I liked the most about the place was how the water changed colours. It was blue one time and light blue a little later.
Walking around the place, we also got to see a waterfall coming out of the lake. The Phoksundo Waterfall is believed to be Nepal’s biggest waterfall.
We also learned that the lake sees a lot of French tourists.

The tourists generally stay at Rigmo Village, which has a few tea houses. However, the lodges haven’t been managed well, which has put a dent in the beauty of the lake.
The walking trail to the lake isn’t as great with a lot of trees obstructing the way. Sometimes, it is quite narrow, which makes it quite difficult for tourists to walk. The mules use the same road which results in dirty trails and unhappy trekkers.
The people believe that enough has not been done to promote this area as a tourist destination. The lawmaker representing Dolpa, Satya Pahadi, shares that even though the place’s natural beauty is known to many, it hasn’t been getting enough tourists.
“This lake and the region’s natural beauty should be promoted by Nepal Tourism Board and its stakeholders. It needs to have sufficient infrastructure, which will make it easy for foreigners to come and enjoy the area,” she shares.

She also informs that the road is what most people complain about. “Tourists have nowhere to go after they visit the lake. There are so many areas which lack trail in the area” she explains.

Pahadi adds that a new committee should be formed for the conservation of both the area and the lake.
Dolpa is quite different, in geographical and cultural forms, from other districts in Nepal. It calls for a unique promotion strategy to develop the area to ensure that the tourists will have a value-for-money travel, demand stakeholders.

Four destinations to start out mountain biking in Kathmandu,"Thursday, December 19, 2019","
Hey guys, I expect my previous three-story series on mountain biking (mtb in short) has helped you get the hang of the basic bike skills and handling; and you must have pulled off quite some off-road short rides to the backcountry.
Maybe you would now like to try some challenging rides.  Let me help you with a lowdown on some locations for you to venture out, which can really turn out as fascinating daylong destinations.
For a start, the destination I am going to chart out for you is a one-day long ride with a moderate to rugged terrains, both paved and dirt including some isolated forested areas. So my advice to you is: Take along a partner with you–so much the better and more fun if you can muster a group of say three to four riders. That will also help you to learn group rapport and group dynamics.
Not to be missed
Hopefully, you will not miss out on the basic essentials for the trip such as a pump, spare tube, patch kit, a toolkit . . . and of course, a rain jacket.  Don’t!  Also, make sure that you are well-hydrated way before you kick off. What I always do before long rides is to drink a litre of oral electrolyte-blended water at least 5 hours before the start (mostly coinciding with a night before) and supplement it with water during the ride. If you are carrying a hydration bladder tucked into your backpack, all the better.
As you sweat a lot and lose a lot of fluid, you need to replenish yourselves to keep yourself hydrated and avoid getting the most dreaded issue like muscle cramps, which can really ruin your entire ride.  Caveat: do not start on a completely empty stomach. A light breakfast before the ride is a good idea.
“Electrolytes are analogous to the motor oil in your car—they don’t make the engine run, but they’re absolutely necessary to keep everything running smoothly. Proper functioning of the digestive, nervous, cardiac, and muscular systems depends on adequate electrolyte levels” writes Steve Born, a sports nutrition specialist.
It will be a good idea to stash in some energy bars or chocolates into your backpack to refuel yourself as you will be burning off a lot of calories doing quite some gruelling up-hills. Also, they can work wonders for your sapping energy and stamina. Bananas, too, can substitute for the energy bars if you forget to carry them.  Needless to write, carry water bottles. And if you wish to have a less sore bum, apply Vaseline under your crotch. And do not forget to put on your padded underwear.

Nagarkot
Everybody knows about this scenic hill town, and most of you might have visited Nagarkot one time or other in a vehicle of some kind.  Of the many cycling destinations, Nagarkot (2,195 metres) comes first in my priority list for beginners as it combines both a tough climb and a thrilling adrenaline-pumping downhill experience. Apart from that, it offers several off-road back routes, some quite challenging.
Nagarkot is like 32-33 km from Kathmandu with Bhaktapur en route. The road is paved all the way.   After crossing the Bhaktapur Bazaar, you have to hit the road to Kharipati. After that, the paved road starts climbing and continues all the way up to Nagarkot. Owing to the recent widening work underway, do not expect it to be a smooth paved ride. The uneven road, gravelly at places, can almost pass for an off-road–so much the better for an mtb rider!
Given the relentless uphill, as a first-timer, it might take you a little over four hours from Kathmandu to Nagarkot including brief respites for a breather and some refreshments; plenty of tea houses line the road. Start early, around seven or eight in the morning, if you want to have lunch at Nagarkot and get back home before dark. Lots of eateries there serve dal-bhat and being a touristy place, also other dishes like pasta, noodles, pizza, whatever you fancy.
From Nagarkot Bazaar, you can ride to the View Tower situated 3.5 km up on a slight hill. You can take a 360-degree panoramic image of the sprawling Himalayas including the Everest if the weather permits and you are armed with a telephoto zoom lens.
The return ride from Nagarkot the same way back will be a half hour to one hour faster since you will be free-wheeling down all the way from Nagarkot to Bhaktapur. Round trip back to Ktm: 64-65 km.
Nagarkot-Changu-Bhaktapur
For the return ride, there are several other options to choose from. First, you can take the Nagarkot- Telkot-Changu Narayan-Bhaktapur (10 km approx.) route which also offers an off-road motor track. After some 3.5 km backtracking from Nagarkot to Telkot junction, you come to a cross-section.
Take the road that goes to Changu. Better ask around, if you get confused about the correct direction. As you ride the Telkot gravelled road towards Changu (6.5km), you come to a fork, the track down goes to Bhaktapur while the one that goes straight heads towards the Changu Narayan shrine.
Said to be more than 3,000 years old and designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Changu Narayan shrine is well worth a visit.  There are two options going back to Bhaktapur:  either you take the paved road or backtrack to the fork you passed earlier and hit the Telkot-Duwakot-Jhaukhel off-road track.  The track crosses the forested Telkot hill down to Bhaktapur past small settlements on the way. Either way, the round trip to Kathmandu will be something like 66-67 km.
Nagarkot-Kattike Bhanjhyang-Shali Nadi-Sankhu- Ktm

Beginners, you will be thrilled to your bones if you hit this trail–a most rewarding experience if you love downhilling. Rugged and challenging this trail will really put your skill to the test. Downhill all the way from Nagarkot, the jeep track is lined by a thick forest until you reach Kattike Bhanjhyang (9 km).
The ride from Kattike, a small settlement, to Shali Nadi, Sankhu (8km) is again all the way down with a section of stone-laden path with steep descents. You have to be extra careful on this bumpy downhill section. The trail crosses isolated forested hills and then gradually opens up to a beautiful countryside as you reach Shali Nadi, another famous Hindu shrine which hosts an annual festival in the month of Magh (January-February).
After Shali Nadi you enter the town of Sankhu also called Shankharapur, said to have been named so for its conch-shell shape. From Sankhu it’s 23 km to Kathmandu or two and a half hours ride. The round trip back home is like 72-73 km.
Nagarkot-Kattike-Jarshing Pauwa-Sankhu-Ktm

This is a little longer route than the rest. From Nagarkot, you descend down to Kattike like you do for Shali Nadi.  You will meet a fork at Kattike. The road to your left goes to Shali Nadi. To head towards Jarshing Pauwa, you have to go straight (4 km) up.  After Kattike, the dirt road starts climbing cutting across small village settlements, forested area, and terraced fields that slope down in a steep drop. If you are lucky, you can see a sweeping view of the snow-capped mountains to your north.
The ride from Kattike to Jarshing Pauwa is like one and a half hours with mostly ascents, some really steep ones.  The elevation of Jarshing Pauwa is 1803 metres. The small village perched on an open hill boasts some good tea houses and a few resorts.
From Jarshinga Pauwa, you are met with a wide paved road that snakes all the way down through a beautiful forest to Lapsephedi and the Sankhu Bazaar (7.5 km).  Round trip to Ktm: 76-77km.
All things considered, the Nagarkot ride promises the beginners a truly thrill-packed getaway, whichever route they chose to ride back–the rides are tough, scenic, educative, challenging–all rolled into one! Caveat: For beginners, this ride can be really tough and gruelling and you might be nursing sore muscles the next day. But it is worth its weight in gold–a most rewarding experience indeed.
Take frequent breaks, soak in the beauty and the ambience of your surroundings, chat with the local people, capture the memorable moments into your camera . . . and do not forget to have that special sweet tea made from buffalo milk at a village tea shop–always my favourite when riding through the country!
Next, I will bring you more such ride info on short, day-long and some longer with night halts. Until then, ride safe and keep the rubber side down!

The buried kingdom of Simraungadh,"Friday, December 6, 2019","
In 2012, I visited Simraungadh, a quintessential Terai town, some 160 km south of Kathmandu. The trip was not planned but a last-minute decision—no more than one of my little quirks. But, much to my astonishment, it turned out the little-known town once prided as a thriving capital city of Mithila kingdom in the 11th century Karnata Dynasty.
After rounding off our pilgrimage to the Gadhimai, a Hindu shrine 20 km northeast of the border city Birgunj, I suggested my wife, Radhika, we pay a visit to Simraungadh, 13 km away. The whole idea of the sudden foray was to dig for clues to my ancestral roots, the early Dolakhes, the people of Dolakha, a hill-town 143 km northeast of Kathmandu.
To Radhika, my idea founded on hearsay (talked about by elders in Dolakha) sounded nothing short of a wild-goose chase. With the puja ritual wrapped up at Gadhimai (the Hindu shrine is also noted for holding the largest animal sacrifice in the world every five years), we drove off to Simraungadh.
Dismal start
We were in for some bad vibes, however. We met a local who told us that only a week ago, a fellow was found murdered on the road to Simraungadh. Another fanned the flames by quipping in that the road cut across some isolated forest stretches was frequented by Indian dacoits.  That gave Radhika quite a fright. I thought the inside stories were a trifle exaggerated, if not just gossip. I managed to get her acquiescence reluctantly, though. There were three of us, Radhika, a priest from Gadhimai who kindly volunteered to guide us, and I. I was behind the wheel of our Hyundai Getz.
Our progress on the badly pitted road was slow, almost a crawl at some places. Some sections of the dirt road required weaseling out of a lot of potholes. All this time, as we sped past deserted locales and wooded stretches, an edgy Radhika kept on casting suspicious looks outside the window.
As we drove along, vast swathes of harvest-ready rice fields flanked the road with thin habitation and insignificant motor traffic—all the more reason for Radhika to get worked-up. All we intercepted, less than halfway, was a solitary bullock-cart lurching along the uneven road with gunny sacks piled high.
The archetypal Terai
Radhika sighed in relief as a few motorbikes and trucks passed by kicking up clouds of dust. Soon, we cruised past small shanty settlements with thatched-roofed mud house, some tiled—the kind so typical about the Terai. We saw men and women going about their ways, some walked, others rode bicycles. The most common sight included women ambling along the side of the road with some kind of a load balanced on their covered heads. Curiously, most of the women, old and young alike, wore white dhotis sans blouses.
As we drove on, I noticed roadside clapboard shops on stilts selling all and sundry but with hardly any customer. Mango groves, Jamun (Indian blueberry), and coconut trees dotted the distant fields. The entire landscape gave a sleepy and deserted look.
Everyone gave a curious look at our passing car, even domestic cattle. While people stopped to look, stray cows, buffaloes, and goats turned their heads at us wide-eyed. Some even spooked.   Excited children ran along the side of the car. Pariah dogs gave a chase barking furiously.
The smell that wafted through our car windows was distinct– burning leaves and the dung-cakes. A strong pungent smell of molasses, at times, stung our nostrils. There was no mistaking the Terai!  Those outer reaches seemed to be under a spell in a timeless past, inching away at its own pace, untouched or undisturbed by the urban boom.
Unusual traffic
After an hour’s dusty ride, we finally arrived in Simraungadh. Nothing looked new, no different from another of those dreary impoverished village towns you see in the terai. The town area boasted a little modernity with crummy tea-houses and shops lining the streets. Modern brick houses and mud hamlets, however, seemed grossly at odds as they huddled together back-to-back.

Squalor and poverty lay behind the town’s incongruous modern façade. The main bazaar bustled with life. Bicycles, rickshaws, motorbikes, tractors, bullock carts, stray animals and occasional tangas (horse-carts) made up the traffic. People milled around amid blaring music belting out Hindi film tunes. Dust and filth appeared all around. Chaos!
After parking our car, we looked around for some help. We wanted to find people who might know about the Dolakhes. I intercepted an elderly dhoti-clad gentleman and asked him. After a quizzical long look at us, he suggested in his broken Nepali we try the main bazaar chowk (square).

Disappointment
In that part of the Terai, the predominant language was Maithili and Bhojpuri. People seemed uncomfortable at speaking Nepali. At the main bazaar, we approached a young fellow in jeans. He looked like a student but all we got from him was a shake of his head. A skeptical Radhika suggested trying some shops. We did but to no avail. After an hour of running around, the dust, the din, and the noonday sun took their toll on us. We were sweating hard and exhausted.
Then, a glimmer of hope… A middle-aged fellow we met at the bazaar asked us to try a certain street. Off we went looking. Some 15 minutes later, we found it. Much to our consternation, we met a family there from Gorkha, and not Dolakha. Blast it! Our informant must have got confused by the similar-sounding words.

With fallen faces, we tried everything; we met on our way back. Our efforts seemed futile. It was time to quit, I thought. So much for my ancestor-hunting! We decided to take a look around the village-town, though.
Tour of the town
Lunch at a roadside eatery proved far-out. To our amazement, the food was served on newsprint paper—a tingling spicy mutton curry with bhuja (dry-roasted rice grain) with slices of onion and radish. The garnishing included a wedge of lemon and a green chilly. For me, the lunch proved an ordeal since I was not used to fiery hot food.
After lunch, we first visited the Kankali Ishra Mata Shrine. Going by history, it was after 1800 BCE that the Indo-Aryans first started building Hindu temples of worship. The locations they chose were picturesque places. Small wonder: Hindu shrines are found mostly on river banks, hilltops, seashores, by the side of reservoirs, and the like. The Kankali shrine boasted an impressive reservoir on its side, which was said to have been built by King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Ishwari Singh. Locals called it the Ishra Pond.
A gaunt bearded fellow, the main priest of the temple, Ram Chandra Das, showed us around the temple site. “Mysteriously, time and again, Goddess Kankali Mai switches her abode to far removed places such as Patna, as Patandevi, to Kolkata as Kali, or Betia, all cities in India’s Bengal and Bihar state,” he said, also shedding light on the myths and legends associated with the deity.
The main temple, a nagara (curvilinear) architecture, housed a three-foot-tall black polished idol of Goddess Kankali Mai—an avatar of Kali, the Hindu goddess of enlightenment and liberation. Curiously, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the idol of Gadhidai we saw earlier at Bariyarpur.
Previously known as Kangankali for the Goddess’s fetish for kangans (bangles), the idol heavily draped in a red shawl and adorned with shiny golden motif, carried the same height and build of Gadhimai.
The idol stood under the extended hood of the mythological Shesh Nag, the thousand-headed cobra. According to Hindu mythology, the Shesh Nag symbolises ‘eternity’ and holds the entire universe on its head. The most striking likeness between the idol at Gadhimai and the Kankali Mai was the large protruding eyes cast in silver.
Only the saffron cloth that draped the Shesh Nag seemed to distinguish them apart. Our guide told us that Gadhimai was an incarnation or avatar of none other than the Kankali Mai.

Next to the shrine stood a 700-year-old domed building with a steeple. Its inner sanctum housed the samadhi (tomb) of Mansha Baba, a revered baba, or saint, who was said to have miraculously entered the earth by his divine powers to breathe his last peacefully.

History
Recalling Nepal’s medieval history, Simraungadh was the capital city of Mithila kingdom (also called Tirhut) in 1097 AD. The Mithila region was bounded by the Mahananda River on the east, the Gandaki on the west, the Ganges on the south and the Himalayas on the north, spreading over half of present-day Bihar State, India. Mithila finds its mention in the sacred Hindu epic Ramayana by Valmiki, too.
The Karnataor Samaroon dynasty was founded by the King of Bengal, Nanyadev in the 11th century. He first ruled Mithila. His successors reigned over Mithila for more than two centuries. The regime ended with the 5th successor, Harisimha Deva (1295-1324 CE) following an invasion of Mithila by the Mughal warrior Ghias-Ud-din Mohammad Bin Tughlak in 1324-25.
Simraungadh was razed to the ground following the siege. King Harsimha Dev and his family fled north into the hills and remained in hiding. Then, with his entourage, he left for Dolakha but died on the way at a place called Tinpata in Sindhuli. There are no two opinions about Harisimha Dev’s flight. Both Nepal and Mithila vaṃśāvalis (genealogies) support it.
However, speculations run high over Harisimha Dev’s post-flight period, and it is the issue much debated amid historians. Some claim King Harisimha Deva, under a refugee status, entered the Nepal Valley (also called Nepal Mandala—Bhadgaon, Kantipur and Lalitpur) around the beginning of the 14th century. Others maintain that he even ruled the Nepal Valley.
The inscription erected at Hanumandhoka by King Pratap Malla (1641-1674 AD) illustrates how Harisimha Dev came to Ashmanagar (Panauti), and then to Nepal Valley. A similar account by Pratap Malla is also to be found at the Pashupatinath inscription. History pages also mention that the Tulaja Bhawani deity was brought to Nepal Valley by Harisimha Dev from Simraungadh. The Malla Kings came to adopt and revere it as their tutelary deity.

Ranibas
Our last visit included the Ranibas, the residence (bas) of the queen (rani).The palace was built by the Karnata King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Queen Isri Devi. The site later came to be converted into a Ram-Janaki Hindu shrine.
History records that in the 1850s (AD), Prime Minister Jung Bahadur’s son General Jit Jung Rana built the temple in memory of his father. Flanked by thick brush, the narrow path that led to the temple opened on to a wide forecourt with a huge gnarled kabhro tree (a kind of fig tree that bears wild fruit used for making pickle). A mango orchard lay next to it.
A flight of steps led to the entrance of a square, two-storied tin-roofed brick structure—said to be the living quarters that surrounded the temple premises. Closely similar to the Kankali temple but much larger and imposing, the two-storied structure was painted in vibrant colors and stood high on a raised platform.
The interior of the temple housed idols of Ram, Sita, and Laxman, three of the mythical gods from the Hindu Ramayana epic. They all sat in a row, while statues of Jung Bahadur Rana, his wife, and son Gen. Jagat Jung, knelt before them with folded hands.
Two large metallic bells, said to have been added to the shrine by Jagat Jung, bore inscriptions dated BS 1933 (1876 AD). In the foreground of the temple, a big statue of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey God from Ramayana, sat on a raised pedestal. “The shrine attracts a capacity crowd of worshippers every year on the day of Ram Navami (birthday of Lord Ram),” informed a local guy.
The courtyard held an ancient well. Stone relics lay in some disarray at a corner of the courtyard. The living quarters for pilgrims girdling the temple appeared in a pitiably run-down state with the walls falling apart. It was clear the premises were sorely neglected.

A pond, said to belong to the olden days, was located on the western periphery of the temple. “The Ranibas used to boast 208 wells and as many lotus ponds, but most are buried, some dried up, and only a handful remains now,” said Anirudra Mishra, a priest at the shrine.
Buried Kingdom
We tried in Simraungadh to locate some ruins that bore the barest testimony to its glorious past. Save for some relics at Ranibas, the locals, however, failed to point even to stray old lumps of bricks that once belonged to the last king’s palace or that fortified the high walls of the old city.
It looked nothing remained, which evoked some faint images of the erstwhile Kingdom.  A local fellow, however, told us that if dug up no deeper than a few feet any place around the 28 sq-km area of the old city, it would fetch medieval-era artifacts and earthen pots. Nay even gold and silver!
Legends, myths, and history spoke loud and clear about Simraungadh’s vibrant past. But on completion of our tour, it was hard to believe that the dusty and dreary little town revelled once as the capital city of a booming medieval kingdom ruled by a sagacious Karnata King. As it stands, the kingdom lies buried into the bowels of the earth.

Ride Through Sindhuligadhi: Three child cyclists steal the show,"Thursday, November 28, 2019","As over 170 cyclists rode to Janakpur from Kathmandu during the 4th edition of the annual Ride Through Sindhuligadhi event last weekend, three kids caught everyone’s eye.
Shubham Shrestha, Suyog Man Basnyat and Aditya Shrestha are just eight, 10 and 13 respectively; but they were all prepared to cycle the 250-kilometre journey to Janakpur via Sindhuligadi.  All three of them seemed to push each other one peddle at a time along with dozens of adults on the way. While Aditya and Shubham skipped a part of the climb to Sindhugadhi from Mulkot, Suyog along with his father Yogendra Man Singh Basnyat completed the entire route on his bicycle.
Many were surprised seeing their stamina. “What these kids are doing is remarkable. Riding with adults along the dangerous tarmac road is quite inspiring. Not only have they pushed each other, but they have also inspired other riders who had self-doubt,” shares Sudip Poudel, the ride leader of the event.
The boys were not only inspirations but were also the stars of the show. From local villagers to fellow riders, everyone wanted a selfie with the trio whenever they stopped for water breaks. They were celebrities for three days.
All three boys picked up cycling from a young age. The fathers of all three, who are also cyclists, over the course of a few years groomed these kids’ passion for cycling.
“Suyog started when he was three, but he began participating in these rallies when he was six. He’s always showed a desire towards cycling. As I ride, he wanted to do the same and I don’t see any harm in him doing this. He enjoys cycling and its challenges and I like to see him overcome these challenges,” shares Yogendra, his father.
The same was the case with Aditya, whose father Deepak Shrestha facilitated his son’s passion for cycling.
“I like him riding his bike and being a part of these events. I feel it gives many people the urge to do the same. He is passionate about it and also enjoys doing this. I hope his love and enthusiasm for cycling never dies,” says Deepak, adding he brought his son Aditya after watching Suyog cycling nearly the entire length of the ride last year.
“I enjoy riding. It makes me feel good. I don’t do enough of these long tours but when I get the chance, I enjoy it quite a bit. Sometimes my father does not let me ride the entire length of these tours, but it’s still fun cycling up to whatever point I can,” adds Aditya.
Shubham too has the same enthusiasm on his face. He rides a bicycle which is clearly for the kids older than him but still, he rides with ease. While peddling, he has to stand up and after he gathers some momentum, he sits down. From a small town of Udayapur, he had come to Kathmandu with his father and his uncle to ride to Janakpur. But due to some problems, his father had to return leaving the eight-year-old with his uncle
His father Chiran shares that Shubham, like Aditya and Suyog, started riding from six.
“We take him on rides regularly in Udayapur. He enjoys it. He loves his bicycle. His technique is quite different but he seems to be comfortable with it. We take him out every Saturday and whenever events like this happen. He’s been the start of the show this year. I hope he can make it here again the next year.”
When asked if he was afraid while riding on the road from Kathmandu to Janakpur, young Shubham says he rather enjoyed it. He shares that he liked the attention he received from others. But he did get a bit angry when asked to take the bus from Khurkot to Sindhuligadhi. Sitting on the bus, he kept on posing the same question, “Why did they put me here? I want to be out there.”
“We took the decision because he’s too young and the uphill is too long. Maybe in a few years’ time, he can do the complete ride,” explains Poudel.
But them being on the trip is enough to motivate cyclists. Rabit Maharjan, an adult participant of the event, shares that watching Suyog climb up the uphill to Sindhuligadhi gave him the motivation to ride on. The same was the case for McDara O’Shea from Ireland. O’Shea, who is embarking on a cycling journey from London to Singapore, shares that all three kids gave him added motivation.
“They are brilliant. You see people watching these kids and admiring their guts and determination. I feel quite privileged to have ridden with these young boys. I hope they carry on cycling,” he adds.
When asked if they will do the ride again, the boys say that they would love to, however, their parents say that only time will tell what happens next.
The orgasiners also feel that the participation of these young boys is important in the longer run. “Last year, we only had Suyog. This year, we had Aditya and Shubham. People have promised us that they too will bring their kids along this ride, which means that these kids are doing something really great,” explains Poudel.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ride-through-sindhuligadhi-three-child-cyclists-steal-the-show.html,travel
Mingma David Sherpa: From porter to mountaineering glory,"Wednesday, November 13, 2019","Growing up in Faktalung, a small village in eastern Nepal, Mingma David Sherpa never thought he would someday climb mountains. No one from the village, where most people are farmers, had ever gone into mountaineering. But when an 18-year-old Mingma David first got to the mountains, he never looked back.
“My first experience in the mountains was when I was working as a kitchen helper in Manaslu in 2009. There I saw senior Nepali mountaineers guide people to the top. That is where I first realised that I wanted to become a mountaineer.”
He started his career as a porter and slowly moved up the ranks to claim his spot as a trekking guide. But his story of how that all panned out is an interesting one.
When Mingma David came to Kathmandu in 2008 with his cousins, he just wanted to stay for a month. But due to unrest in the Terai, roads to his village were closed which meant going back to Faktalung was impossible.
“We couldn’t go back. There was no chance of that. I was in grade 9 and felt that staying in Kathmandu was the right thing to do. But as I didn’t have money I started so looking for jobs and found one when some I knew asked if I wanted to go on a trek as a porter.”
Someone who wanted to earn money, Mingma David couldn’t deny that offer and started his career in tourism as a porter. As a porter, he went around the Annapurnas, Langtang, and Manaslu. However, he didn’t have to continue as a porter for long. As he knew how to read and speak English, he was soon promoted to tour guide.
But after working in the trekking business for two years, he wanted a change. That change came when he was part of the 2009 Manaslu expedition. “I was a kitchen helper. But I wanted to do more. I wanted to climb. I felt my body could do well in the altitude and felt I could also climb the mountains like my fellow brothers.”
After his stint in Manaslu, he yearned for more. He took part in Nepal Mountaineering Association-organised basic mountaineering and rescue courses. But he still needed someone to take a chance on him. That someone was his uncle Dorje Khatri, who gave Mingma David the chance to climb Everest.
“I approached my uncle and expressed my desire to climb Everest. As he too was an Everest summiteer, he saw the passion in my eyes and told me to join his Everest expedition team as an assistant guide.”
Mingma David, during that time, was appearing for his SLC. But realising this was an opportunity he could not give up on, he went to Everest after sitting for four exams only.
Mingma David Sherpa’s first expedition took him to the north face of the mountain. He says that when he went there he had a point to prove – both to himself and to other mountaineers. He wanted to prove that he belonged in the mountains and that he too could also make it as a mountaineer.
He says his first real test came in final days at Everest. He was asked to take eight oxygen tanks from 7,000 metres to 8,000 metres. He had never been that high and says he was pretty scared. However, a gutsy Mingma David did it and he did before anyone else.
“It was heavy, but I didn’t take any breaks and reached there in one go. The only break I took was to drink water once and then to put on glasses when the sun came out. My friends who I was climbing with me were worried about the pace I was going by. But I did it before anyone. That was an amazing experience,” he adds.
He says the time he spent with his uncle at camps and in the mountain itself was invaluable. It made him who he is right now. And after being one of very few to reach the top from his group it gave him a lot of confidence. “I felt I belonged in the mountains. You can’t express these feelings. It was amazing,” he says with a bright smile on his face.
After the first summit soon came the second and the third and by 2012 he’d already been on top of Everest three times. In the span of three years, he went on from becoming a normal trekking guide to a mountain guide and that too without going home.
But he was not complacent. He trained a lot and continued to take high-level courses in order to become a better mountaineer.

Since then he’s not looked back and has continued to climb mountains. By 2014 he had climbed Everest four times, K2, Makalu, Cho Oyu – once and Manaslu twice. But in 2014, an incident happened which questioned him it was worth climbing these high mountains at all.
His mentor Khatri died after an avalanche swept him and other sherpas at the Khumbu icefall. Talking about that incident makes Mingma David Sherpa emotional.
“I know that what we do isn’t safe. It’s full of risk. When the news came to me I was in Makalu. I was shattered. He had done so much for me and he was gone. That was a real eye-opener if you ask me. It was when I decided that we needed rescue teams here in the mountains. But my efforts alone could not make it possible.”
He says he did consider leaving the profession. But after thinking long and hard he says it would have been wrong to give up on it. Mingma David then started to work around forming a rescue team because he felt that as mountaineers there was no guarantee of coming back. He says that even if someone is a millionaire that person might get stuck in one of the high mountains, and never come back.
“Money doesn’t guarantee safety which is why in 2016 I was leading a rescue team at Everest. We saved 52 lives that year. But we could not continue that as we did have the funding. I think the government should do this but in our country, things are not that simple.”
It was in 2016 that he met Nirmal Purja Magar. Magar knew Mingma David Sherpa’s uncle Khatri and had climbed Lobuche peak together. Magar had also wanted to climb Everest with Khatri, but after he received the new of Khatri’s death, he decided to meet Mingma David.
“I was told that Nims dai (Magar) wanted to meet me. We met in Kathmandu and started planning. He first climbed a few mountains in 2017 and 2018. It was in 2018 when we decided to do Project Possible.”
“Initially, there were doubts but then we slowly started planning. we set aside phases. and after talking to others who’d done 14 peaks we felt it would be possible to do in 7 months,” he shares adding that they knew that no one had given them a chance. But looking back he says that having helped Magar in this incredible feat, he was extremely happy.
Mingma David created his own record along with Magar. When he stood on top of Shishapangma on October 29, his sixth mountain of the year, Mingma David became the youngest to climb all 148,000m peak.
“It’s a good feeling. But I still have a lot more to give to this industry.”
When asked if his and Magar’s feat has put Nepali mountaineers back where they belong (on the top), he says the project wasn’t about it. He says that these records are not that important. “These records are meant to be broken. I know people are calling us out telling us we used bottled oxygen and helicopters. But I’m sure if these legends like Messner had these, they’d have done the same. Times have changed and I think what we’ve done is to show what the human body can do. I guess we are part of a larger research.”
Talking about what satisfied him the most during this year’s expeditions, he selflessly says the rescues they carried out on Annapurna and Kanchenjunga.
“Rescuing Mr Chin on Annapurna was tough but we did it. Yes, he died later on in his native country, but we gave him a chance. That’s the most satisfying thing for us mountaineers. Nims dai and I also carried out rescues in Kanchenjunga around 8,400m. They too didn’t survive but looking back we did everything we could.”
Mingma David says that he will continue to climb and guide people. He wants to help people realise their dream. But he says he will also continue to push for rescue team at mountains because he realises that it is important because mountains and dangerous and it could help everyone – even Nepali climbers.

"Living with Mahakali, the river of contradictions [Photo story]","Thursday, October 17, 2019","The Mahakali is a river of contradictions. The river, which originates near the Tibetan plateau, is rich in resources, yet people living on its banks are poor and marginalised; the river nourishes life on its banks, but it also wreaks havoc from time to time.
The Mahakali bridge, which connects Chandani and Dodhara villages to the rest of Nepal is also full of contradictions. While sand and pebbles mined on the banks of the river are used to build concrete bridges elsewhere, the bridge here is made of metal.





The Mahakali gushes through the slopes of western Nepal carrying debris and sand with it. The sand is mined and transported to the market. The contradiction here is that while the sand provides much-needed life-saving money for the local community, unscientific mining has increased the risk of life-threatening floods. In addition to that, destructive fishing practices such as poisoning and electrocution of fish in the river are also taking a toll on local livelihood.

With most of the men in the area leaving their homes in search of work in India and beyond, it is now up to the local women to take up the challenge to deal with the contradictions of the Mahakali. With support from Oxfam’s Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA), they have formed women’s groups to lobby for policy changes to conserve the river and its resources.
While the groups are just starting out, their work looks promising. Some of the groups have set up fish conservation areas where destructive fishing has been banned. The groups hold regular discussions with local representatives of their municipalities to discuss ways to conserve the river.
The Mahakali river has changed a lot; some of the changes may be irreversible. But there is a hope that the local communities will take the lead to save it.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/living-with-mahakali-the-river-of-contradictions-photo-story.html,travel
Trekking the untravelled path to Khopra Danda,"Wednesday, October 16, 2019","When Chitra Pun told us we couldn’t get rooms at Khopra Danda even though we were the first to reach there, all of us were disappointed. The place was our main destination where Harman, Ranjan and I had planned to spend two days. However, Pun’s disrespectful behaviour towards us, and towards all Nepalis in general, put us off.
That one day nearly overshadowed our entire trip, but overall it was tiresome and memorable. We walked through some dense forests, up and down some steep hills and got to view the majesty of the mountains.
For someone as lazy as I am, I nearly walked 50 kilometres in five days which is something I had never done even on flatlands.
Even though I didn’t meet as many people as I would’ve liked on the trail, walking to Khopra is possibly one of the best treks I’ve done in my life, one that has taught me that you can walk as much as you can while you’re out in the wild.
Kathmandu to Ghandruk
I had never imagined hopping on a non-ac night bus to Pokhara from Kathmandu would be as tiring as it was. After failing to book tickets for other better buses, we had to board the one, humid, stinky and full of people. By the time we got to Pokhara at 5 am, we were shattered. However, getting to Pokhara was only the first part of our trip. We still had to get to Ghandruk, from where we had planned to start our week-long trek to Khopra Danda and back.
As soon as the local bus to Ghandruk started to move, I felt that the plan to save time by taking a night bus to Pokhara was a bad idea. My knees were cramped for room and the awful roads didn’t help my cause either. It was five hours of hell before we reached Kimche, from where our hour-long hike to Ghandruk started. I never thought that walking would be better than the bus ride. The weather at Ghandrunk wasn’t great, but still, the air was fresh and the people were lovely. Our trek had officially begun.
Ghandruk to Isharu
After a comfortable stay at the Old Village Inn, we were on our way to Dobato. I didn’t want to walk as much as the boys insisted and this was going to be a long day as maps.me showed that Dobato was nearly 12 km away.
The initial walk to Tadapani was quite easy. You go downhill from Ghandruk for around 30 minutes, after which the trail starts to get uphill. I was told that the trail during the spring would have a lot of rhododendrons; however, I also came across a lot of monkeys on the trail.
The trail from Tadapani onwards was quite poor. It’s probably the worst trail I’d ever walked. It’s muddy, and not marked well. It is mostly uphill, especially up to a small resting spot called Meshar. The trail after that got a bit better, but still muddy. What made it worse was constant drizzling and misty weather. Had it been sunny, I guess I’d have enjoyed it more but when we came to a small village called Isharu, I couldn’t walk any longer. My mates decided Dobato was a long shot watching my state and decided to call it a day. Thank god!
Isharu wasn’t the best of place on the trail but surrounded by hills, it was quite nice. If you concentrated, you could see Pokhara and the Phewa Lake in the distance. The view made me regret staying there as the view from Dobato would have obviously been better, but the mushroom curry and rice wine we got there made up for most of it. As we were the only three people at the lodge, we were also given a lot of blankets.
Isharu to Dhan Kharka
The day didn’t start as planned. We woke up late which no mountain view and it also meant that the day would end late. We had to walk another 10kms which didn’t go down well with me. But without being fussy, I was on my way.
The initial walk up to Dobato was not hard. It took time, but the trail was quite nice. We even saw glimpses of Annapurna South behind the clouds. The trail was a bit narrow but I was not as bad the one up to Meshar. We reached Dobato relatively quickly, however, we did not get to see the view.
After a quick tea, we then started the walk up to Bayeli Kharka. This was probably the best part of this trail. It was mostly flat as you had to walk through some pretty narrow ridges. It was fun and it wasn’t hard. The cool breeze kept on reminding you that you were close to the mountains. There was no one on the trail, which felt great. I was walking alone looking at birds flying, bees taking nectar from flowers and hills far away basking in the sunlight. It was probably my best walk during the entire trip.
But that happiness suddenly disappeared. After lunch at Bayeli, the gruelling downhill walk started. What was better was the trail. We walked on a wideish path along the forest and met a few sheepherders. But soon, the trail got worse as the jungle kept getting denser and the trail to Dhan Kharka got narrower and worse.
The trail kept on going up and downhill crossing waterfalls after which narrow uphills began. What made it irritating was lack of trail marks, which was why I had to look for boot and trekking pole marks to ensure I was going on the right path. Add leeches to the trail and now you have a walk which will surely creep a lot of trekkers.
When I saw Dhan Kharka from afar, my happiness was beyond everything. I had made it. My mates had reached the place an hour earlier and were quite worried if I was lost. They were just as happy to see me as I was happy to see Dhan Kharka.
Our plan was to go to Khopra, but due to congestion, we were advised to stay at Dhan Kharkha also known as Chistibung. The lodge owners there were quite nice and always smiling but the food was crap. I don’t think I’ve ever eaten such disgusting food. However, their hospitality made up for the food. After chatting with the lodge owners sitting in the kitchen, we called it a night.
Dhan Kharka to Khopra and back
Whenever I recall that day, all I want to do is punch Chitra Pun. Ranjan wanted to go to Khayer Lake so we started at 6 am. He was up there before 8 am followed by me who reached there around 8:30. But Harman was nowhere to be seen. He had overtaken me as soon as we started climbing but he hadn’t reached the top. We were worried. “Surely he lost his way,” said Ranjan. But there wasn’t anywhere to get lost. The trail was quite bad but it was relatively easy as it was mostly uphill for nearly 90 minutes, after which it got quite flat.
After waiting for two hours, we were thinking of heading down but then Harman arrived. He told us that he got lost on the way while trying a shortcut. We were extremely relieved. But he was disappointed that we were not allowed to stay there.
However, before we got back, Pun said, “No hard feelings. It’s just the way it is.” He told us that they could not give rooms to the domestic tourists as they spend less and make more noises.
Disappointed by his attitude, we went back to Dhan Kharka, where Harman said we should stay an extra day. As I’d walked more in two days than I had in the past two months, I didn’t complain as I could rest for a day. We stayed at Dhan Kharka, drinking and talking to fellow trekkers who too had been denied a place at Khopra. None of us liked Chitra Pun. We met a boy who’d come from Ghorepani who had heard about Pun’s antics as well. “The lodge manager at Ghorepani told me that Pun is an ass. Your stories prove that,” he told us as we looked at the stars on a clear night sky.
I swear I had never seen so many stars. It just made that day in Dhan Kharka even better.
Dhan Kharka to Ghorepani
Another 10-km day! So we started early. We were told that the trail wasn’t hard; that was a relief. I and Ranjan headed towards Ghorepani while Harman went towards Khopra. He was going to have a long day.
The first stretch from Dhan Kharka to Swanta was easy. Some uphill, but it was mostly easy downhill until you reached a hydropower project site, surrounded by marijuana plants. The trail then moved through a jungle with a narrow path that had nettle plants on both sides. Some said the walk was scary but I thought it was calm, walking through the jungle. In no time, we reached Swanta where I and Ranjan settled down for our first proper meal since Ghandruk.

After a proper chicken dinner, we started our walk towards Ghorepani. The locals told us the walk was easy but we didn’t find it easy. Walking through more narrow paths through jungles, we reached Chitre after which the gruelling walk towards Ghorepani began. I could see the place from a distance but it was always that bit further. Gasping for breath slowly, I eventually reached the place and we picked a hotel and called it a day.
The first thing both of us did was a hot shower after nearly a week. Then, we waited for Harman whose last message had come from Swanta.
After waiting for nearly four hours, Harman arrived. He looked exhausted. But he also looked relieved when he saw us. As soon as he came, so did the rain and that came as a relief as walking such an uphill in the rain would be a mammoth task even for him.
Thundershower meant the place also didn’t have lights so we called it an early night as we’d thought we might have gone to Poon Hill the next day.
Ghorepani to Ulleri
The next morning Ranjan called us out asking if we were going to Poon hill. But none of us were bothered. We’d been to Khopra which had similar views and Poon Hill could be done another time. We had a good night’s sleep and headed towards Ulleri from where we hoped to get on a jeep.
The trail to Ulleri was all downhill. It was quite easy. I’d call it the easiest day. After four days of walking such ridiculous trails, this one I felt was a piece of cake.
It took us three hours to get to Ulleri, where we had to bargain for a jeep which took Rs 1,000 to Nayapul. We had no choice so gave him that. From Nayapul, we found a jeep to Pokhara, where were spent the night before coming back to Kathmandu.

Driving the original 1955 Series One Land Rover (‘Oxford’), Bescoby and an experienced team are remaking history for a new generation of adventurers. This time, the team will forge the path through some of the densest jungles, highest mountains and most arid deserts on the planet, returning the car from Singapore to London.
Currently, Bescoby is in Nepal part of the Last Overland expedition where he along with his team are driving from Singapore to London on a 64-year-old Land Rover. Onlinekhabar caught up with Bescoby and talked to him about his journey so far and what he aims to achieve through this extraordinary journey. Excerpts:
How has the journey been so far?
It’s been amazing. I had pretty high expectations when they approached me and I have not been let down at all. It feels I’ve been doing this forever now and it’s a wonderful life. I have a wonderful team. We get up every day, meet new people, and see new places where we’ve never been to before. We also get to learn so many things every day. We eat fantastic food and often bump into landrover lovers who come out to see and speak to us just to see the car.
It has been tiring moving all the time, but it’s been a wonderful experience so far. There’s been a lot of variety so far. Roads have been good in most places but we’ve also had some really poor roads but all in all, I’d say it’s been fun.
Where have you been so far?
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Northeast India and now Nepal. And what’s wonderful is that the way we’re travelling we’re learning new things about cross-border cultures. When you fly into a place you assume that the geographical borders are where the cultures stop. But you realise that when you cross from Thailand to Myanmar, a lot of people there speak the same language, share the same faith. Same with travelling through northeast India, we’ve seen six or seven major ethnic groups which are similar to northwest Myanmar. The past few days, we spent with people speaking Nepali and identifying themselves as Gurkhas in northeast India. That is what I’ve been finding very fascinating. When you travel by road slowly, how the different national cultures they sort of mix and blend with each other.
How long have you been on the road?
It is a long way. We’ve been on the road for 36 days now and still have around two-and-a-half months to go. It turns out flying is a lot easier than driving from Singapore to London.
So you’re not rushing then?
What would be the point in that? We’re not racing against anyone. We’re in an old car and want to enjoy this journey. We also want to see these incredible places and learn about new cultures because you never know when we’ll be able to travel to these places.  It would be a real shame to just drive through these wonderful places.
When do you plan to be back in London?
Our deadline is Christmas. I think we are on track.
What was the first thing that came across your mind when you were asked to go on this journey?
It was the opportunity of a lifetime. The pieces started to fall for the project when I started to get excited. Tim Slessor wanted to do it. The old car was available and restored. We had sponsors like the Singapore Tourism Board and Land Rover came in and told us they’d make it possible. That is when I felt this was going to be an adventure of a lifetime and I haven’t been disappointed.
How is the car?
It’s good. Oxford is 64 years old. She has no power steering, no disk brake, no air conditioning, very very poor windscreen wipers which I have realised in the past few days. And she leaks through the roof and she’s drafty. But by god, she is fun to drive. I call her ‘she’ because Tim always called her ‘she’. He called this car the old lady.
I feel this car has a personality that you get to know gradually and that’s wonderful because this isn’t a normal car. You’re not protected from the environment. You feel the road, you feel the weather, it’s noisy and it’s hard work because you have to concentrate. It makes the journey more fun I’d say.

What advice did Tim give you before starting the journey?
It was nice of him to come to Singapore with us. The initial plan was for him to come with us, but his health got bad so he didn’t join us. But in the build-up to that, Tim gave me some practical advice which has come in handy so far into the journey. From how to pack the cars, to how to approach scheduling and resting, how to eat how to drink. But I remember two pieces of advice the most: one was to drive fast on bumpy roads or else oxford will rattle into pieces and the other one was whatever disagreement we’d have as a team, he told us to make sure it didn’t last the day.
What has each country taught you so far?
Well, Singapore taught me how much you can get done in 24 hours. That city is incredible. Anything you want to get done in 24 hours you can do. In Malaysia, I learned how much those people loved Land Rovers. I was absolutely blown away. In Thailand, I learned to appreciate good roads, 7/11s, good petrol stations and great food. Myanmar, where I’ve lived for many years, taught me the value of air conditioning. It was absolutely boiling there.
Northeast India blew my mind. It taught me how little I knew about India and the variety of culture and history there. Even the terrain was quite surprising. And here in Nepal nothing yet. I’ve just been here and I hope I get to learn a lot from this country too. The welcome has been amazing. We’ve been looked after by the Gurkha Welfare Trust who have been simply amazing.
Where will you be travelling around Nepal?
Well, from Damak, we’re going to Pokhara where we’ll spend a few days. We’ll take the car to Sarangkot. After that, we’ll go to Kathmandu where we’ll prepare for our trip to China which is going to be quite tough. We’re exiting via Kerung into China which is going to be hard work. Travelling through some remote places in China, going through some of the highest roads in the world, we want to relax in Kathmandu and immerse ourselves in the festival. Looking forward to having a good time in Nepal.
What’s been your biggest challenge so far?
I’d say the car. Just keeping the car in good condition has been a challenge. It’s been challenging to drive especially on the Indian highways where people drive on the wrong side of the road. Making sure the car is okay has been a challenge. We broke down in Darjeeling where there were a lot of Land Rover mechanics which was a lot of help. Bad roads have also been a challenge.
Has the journey been better than what you’d hoped it would be?
Absolutely. I hadn’t expected such a good response. I had thought that we would be driving through countries and no one would care. But that has not been the case. Both the response the road and where we’re stopped has been staggering. People have given us free meals and free hotels, something which I had not imagined we would be getting. The response online has been quite amazing. Both on Facebook and Instagram.
When Tim fell ill we thought people would not be interested in our journey but we were wrong. People have absolutely loved what we’re doing so far. What we’ve realised is that the car is much a celebrity as Tim.
What do you plan to achieve through this? Is this doing it for doing its sake or is there a greater calling?
I mean there is this doing it for doing its sake in a way because the journey that Tim went on to define his life. And 64 years later, he and his friends are still talking about it.
Then another question arose – can we do it? Will the car make it? Politically can we get across borders without much trouble? We also wanted to see if the world was more dangerous than it was 64 years ago or is it safer?
Personally I wanted to investigate what had changed in the world in the past 64 years.
There are obviously bad things going around in the world, but I want to show people that on the ground level people are lovely. And I hope I inspire other people to travel slowly across countries and hope they realise that the world is a better place.
The First Overland came via Afghanistan and Syria, but you’re not taking that route. The world was more interconnected in the past, but can’t move as freely now. Comments?
We could try going through Afghanistan and Syria, but it would be stupid. We don’t want to take so many risks. What interesting about this route we’re taking now is we’ve moving freely across China and Central Asia, something the 1955 team could never do. There is no way that six Britons could drive through China and the USSR without conflicts. Just shows how the world has changed.

"Everest climb in autumn sounds tough, but can be done: Garrett Madison","Sunday, September 8, 2019","
Garrett Madison is one of the most sought-after foreign climbers and mountain guides. Since he first summited Everest in 2006, he has led over 60 climbers to the summit of Everest and started his own company, Madison Mountaineering.
Madison holds multiple high-altitude mountaineering world records. He is the only person to have climbed Mount Everest and Lhotse in a day, that too three times. He is also the only American to have climbed K2 twice. Madison spoke to Onlinekhabar about his current expedition where he plans to take a team to the top of Everest in autumn for the first time since 2010 and about mountaineering in Nepal. Excerpts:
How did you go from being a mountain guide to starting your own company?
I started working as a mountain guide in 1999 when I was 20. It was a summer job to guide people up Mount Rainer. That is how I started. As I loved mountaineering, I joined Alpine Accents International and worked for them until 2014 when I thought why not start my own company. That’s how Madison Mountaineering started. My maiden project was to lead the climb on Everest in 2014 and it’s been a fun but a challenging adventure ever since.
How different was running your own company from working for an expedition company?
It’s basically the same stuff that I do now. It is just a bit more responsibility on the logistic side. But I have a good team that handles it. So I’d say I’m lucky in that regard.
You recently climbed Everest in the spring season, what made you come back in the autumn?
I’ve never climbed Everest in autumn. However, I have attempted other 8,000 metre peaks such as Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu in autumn. But I wanted to do Everest too. The main reason is that we’re doing Everest this year because Mountain Hardware, which makes clothing equipment for high altitude climbing wanted to test its new product line. We felt that the best place and time to test it was on Everest in the autumn. We’ll be testing everything from down suits to sleeping bags to tents.
Apart from that, we at Madison Mountaineering wanted to do something unique. As the spring season is overcrowded, we wanted to see if we can market Everest for the autumn. That would help minimise the crowd during the spring. Everest hasn’t been summited in autumn since 2010 and we want to see if we can change that. We have some good climbers on the mountain like Kilian Jornet and Andrzej Bargiel so hopefully, we can work together to reach the top. Our Nepali climbers are just as good and are currently fixing ropes and arranging the base camp so we’re positive about this expedition.
But I am concerned that it’s been raining so much. Rain here means a lot of snow in the mountains and that means there’s a risk of avalanches.
How different do you expect that mountain to be in autumn as compared to spring?
Well, post-monsoon is different for a variety of reason. Firstly, there’s is a lot of snow up there. Secondly, there are a lot fewer people on the mountain. In spring, there are around a 400-500 people on the mountain, but now there’s going to be around 10-15 max. Autumn is also more winter-like. With winter around the corner days will be shorter and will be windier. The summit weather window will also be shorter. Will be a lot challenging. I’ve done Everest 10 times all in the spring so if we can prove that Everest can be done in the autumn that would be great.
How’s rope fixing going on amidst the rain?
It’s going on at a slow pace. The weather isn’t good and the Nepali climbers have told me that it’s very cloudy up there. They are one-quarter of the way up the Khumbu icefall. They’re hoping they’ll reach Camp 1 in a week’s time. Our plan is to reach base camp by mid-September and hope by then they’ll be able to reach Camp 2.
Your success rate is quite high. What, according to you, makes a good mountain guide?
I’d say lots of experience and willingness to learn from mistakes and surrounding yourself with good people. You’ll also need some natural ability and some physical fitness to function well in the death zones. Apart from that we also need proper mountain training and techniques. It’s a combination of knowledge and skill I would say.
People often say that climbing in Europe and the Americas is different from climbing in the Himalayas. How true is that?
It’s very true.  In America and the Alps, it’s more like one-day climbs. You start from a mountain hut and climb for one day and your back. You’re just out for a day or maybe half a day. But here you’re up for two weeks. It’s a real expedition here. Have to carry a lot of stuff to be self-sufficient like medical kits, food and a lot more. There is also no quick evacuation. In the Alps, you get a helicopter rescue at any point, but you don’t get that luxury here in the Himalayas.
What do you feel is the toughest part of being a mountaineer?
I guess it’s the sacrifices you have to make. Spending all this time away from family and loved ones isn’t easy. It’s not like a normal job where you leave home and come back in the evening every day. I’m out for two-three months at a time, and spend around 10 months on the road in a year. So I’d that that is the toughest part.
Do clients appreciate your effort when you take them to the top?
They do. I feel happy when they do. But there are times when I cannot fulfil their expectations and they’re not happy. But I try to tell them that their life is much important that the summit. I don’t like risking people’s lives. My first priority is to make sure everyone comes back safe, this includes the Nepali climbers we have on our team.
Do you enjoy climbing mountains? Here the people from Khumbu climb because they don’t have a choice. They say it’s not fun. Do you have fun?
Yes, I love climbing. This is my passion. When I was a young man and climbed my first mountain I didn’t want to look back. In the US it’s not a lucrative profession, but I didn’t care about it. Because when you do something you love, you don’t feel like its work. I love the challenge too. Made a lot of memories climbing and will continue to do so.
How satisfied do you get when to take clients up to the summit?
It’s very satisfying as you’ve helped them reach their goal and also helped changed them in a positive way. What I like is how people get new experiences in a foreign land. They tell me they learn a lot about the country as they spend from a few weeks to a few months depending on where they are. They also make friends and take back more than just a climbing certificate.
What do you love the most about the mountains?
Just being out there in nature with similar-minded people. We share the same passion and enthusiasm. It’s just the best thing.
When we talk about Everest, we have to talk about the traffic jam picture. For someone who was there, how bad was it?
Well, it wasn’t as bad as the photograph. It was a busy day but it wasn’t the busiest day I’ve seen on Everest. The reason why it looked so crowded was that there were 200 people queuing up to reach the summit. If you have 100 people going up and another 100 people coming down there is sure to be a traffic jam. That’s when the photo was taken. But the media thinks that it is like that all the time which it’s not. It was maybe one hour, one day, in one year. Feel it was blown out of proportion.
Would you blame the traffic jam for all the deaths?
I don’t think I would. The lives lost in Everest this year could have been saved with good planning and good managing. There are two types of expeditions on Everest. There is a guided expedition like mine where they hire someone like me and my company to manage logistics and in the long run take them to the summit and also make decisions for them.
And then there is the other type of expedition is when a company just manages the climber’s logistics like permits, oxygen, porters and food. But in these expeditions, the climber makes his own decisions.  The company doesn’t tell them to turn around if they can’t climb. That is when people die. Because when you’re up there you can’t think straight. And if you’re not experienced that can cause a lot more problem.
Those that died this year didn’t have experience climbing such a tough mountain.

Will the government’s plan to make it mandatory to climb a mountain in Nepal before attempting Everest prevent these deaths?
I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try to ensure that Everest climbers are more qualified. However, with this rule, if a climber has climbed K2, he/she would still be ineligible to climb Everest which is wrong in my opinion. It doesn’t make sense to me.
How has mountaineering changed in Nepal since you first came here in 2006?
For starters, there are a lot more people in the sport. I feel the sport has grown for several reason. People want to go to these iconic places like the top of Everest. And now that’s it’s possible for more people, the mountain has seen a lot of people since I first climbed in 2006.
Is the rapid growth in Nepali expedition companies the reason why the number of people climbing Everest as risen significantly?
These new Nepali companies are simply offering a product that has a demand in the market. The climbers want this product. They want to be able to come and climb Everest at a cheaper price. Some people feel they don’t want a guy like me making decisions on their behalf. They want to make their own decisions. The clients are demanding this service and the companies we see now are just fulfilling their demands.
But is that the reason the mountains are getting inexperienced climbers which causes deaths on these 8000 m peaks?
The business model for Nepali companies is different from mine. I make sure that I have experienced climbers on my team and try to keep my team small up to 12 members. The team has high-level support as we have both high-level mountain guides and experienced Nepali high altitude climbers. Along with that we also have top equipment and ample supply of oxygen. I try to offer and run a good program on the mountain.
But the Nepali companies’ model is different. They believe in volume. They offer a similar programme for a much lower cost. Per person, there is a much smaller profit margin, but if you’re able to bring in numbers, you’re definitely going to make money. So their product is volume-based and it’s not a guided trip. The climber makes his/her own decision. The companies provide just logistics and service to climb the mountain, but there’s no one telling them if it’s safe to go up. Well, they have Nepali high altitude climbers but they can’t tell their clients not to go up and it’s dangerous.
The fatalities are that of climbers who don’t have experience and really want to go to the top of a mountain. The people compare prices and always choose a Nepali company as its half cheaper than companies like mine charge. These people don’t have anyone to ask if it’s worth the risk. Most push themselves which makes it tough on their body and collapse.
What makes you different from these other companies?
My risk tolerance is lower than theirs. They tend to think they can do anything, whereas I feel that I can’t. It’s because I am liable for the safety of my clients which is of paramount importance. I need to take that into consideration before making a risky decision. It a fundamental difference of approach. Some of my clients get really irked when people from other expedition agencies summit and we don’t. It happened this year in K2 when we came back because it was not worth the risk. But one client was not happy that we didn’t summit and other teams did. It is hard to explain to people like him that it’s not worth it. But hey, they pay a lot of money so they are right to think that way I guess.

Angling the water tigers: A breakthrough in adventure tourism,"Thursday, August 29, 2019","“There he stood, the Mahseer of the Poonch, beside whom the Tarpon is a herring and he who catches him can say he is a fisherman.” Rudyard Kipling (Jungle Book, 1894).
Virtually, cut off from the rest of the world until the 1950s, Nepal saw the dawn of tourism after an intrepid duo set foot on this little “mythological Shangri-La” to scale the Everest. That venturous duo were Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. At 11:30 am on May 29, 1953, the Everest was conquered . . . and world history was rewritten.
The historic event catapulted our little known country to global fame. Adventure tourism, thus, saw its birth in Nepal. With time, it diversified. After the top-draw adventure attraction of mountaineering, came trekking, followed by wildlife safari and white water rafting. Human’s hunger for more adventure, however, would not let up.
Braver diversions
Old concepts turned passé. To woo more tourists, newer concepts like ‘eco tours’, ‘green tours,’ ‘cultural tours,’ ‘soft tours,’ ‘adventure tours’ and the like heralded a revamping of the travel notion.
Soon followed braver diversions, the likes of rock climbing, canyoning, paragliding, hot air ballooning, mountain biking, bungee jumping, skydiving, zip flying—and still counting! Ski-mountaineering and ski-diving? You heard it right.  That’s another adventure notion the travel operators have tweaked into their itinerary.
Worldwide sport
Surprisingly, angling or fishing tours in Nepal still seems almost an uncharted domain, less explored and waiting to be tapped. Neighbouring India, on the other hand, has made quite a leap into this field.

Sportfishing in India has flourished substantially in the last two decades and almost every travel operator includes angling trips in their holiday itineraries. This adventure sport lures worldwide anglers to India in pursuit of the legendary Golden mahseer (tor putitora), the ultimate dream fish of every serious freshwater angler.
The popular angling destinations in India include the upper Ganges with her many tributaries in North India like the Ram Ganga (flows through the Corbett National Park), Saryu and Kali at Pancheswor, Uttarakhand, for the golden mahseer, and the river Cauvery rising in the mountainous region of Coorg in the Western Ghats in the Karnataka state, for the monster-size hump-backed mahseer.
Dedicated anglers from around the world spend fortunes to travel thousands of miles to India in pursuit of this charismatic game fish. Tours are typically booked up to a year in advance through travel agents or online.
Considering its endangered status, the Indian government has passed strict directives to release all such mahseer catches. You catch it, then gingerly hold it in your arms, weigh it, measure it, strike a pose with it for a photo, and finally release it gently back into the waters where it belongs.
Over the past few decades, the trend of tourism in Nepal has gone through a dramatic diversification, with adventure tourism taking an edge over others. Some years ago, a news item headlined “Nat Geo hails thrill-seekers’ paradise” pointed out that National Geographic identified Nepal and Brazil among the top-draw adventure destinations in the world.
This came as welcome news. Given proper promotion, angling for mahseer in our torrential snow-fed rivers tucked into the foothills of the exotic Himalayas guarantees the visitors newer horizons of virgin wilderness, adventure, and truly a fantastic angling itinerary.

In recent years, a handful of Nepali travel operators have included fishing in their itinerary.  Such trips are, however, a far cry from the organised fishing carried out by many outfitters in neighbouring India.

Owing to lack of professionalism, inadequate data and research on the aquatic life, and insufficient expertise and handling experience to back such ventures, the potential of running fishing expeditions as a full-fledge adventure destination has not been fully tapped in Nepal. More than that, for the past few decades, the legendary mahseer has had a trying time caused by human encroachment and depletion of natural resources.
Threatened
The 2018 Living Planet Report, published every two years documented an alarming 60 per cent decline in the population of wildlife on earth, both terrestrial and aquatic. Depletion of natural biodiversity, on the other hand, threatens the planet to its brim. Human encroachment and the atrocity against wildlife on the face of the earth did not spare Nepal, too.
And today’s buzz-words ‘global warming’ and the ‘greenhouse’ gas emissions have kept the scientists on the edge of their seats since the turn of the 20th century.
Considered a national heritage by ichthyologists, the status of mahseers in Nepal is far from satisfactory. In truth, they are heavily threatened and fall under the IUCN Red List.  The causes for this are not far to seek.
Unethical killing
Yes, in the past few decades, the ‘popular’ but grossly unethical methods of fishing have only worsened to assume alarming proportions. The mahseer has fallen victim to blast-fishing, poisoning, electrofishing, and fishing during the spawning season. Rampant gill-netting with no regard for the size of the mesh (decimating mother and fingerlings both) has become a ‘joyriding’ epidemic. And to make a quick buck, people go to any length.
During one of my fishing trips to the Tama Koshi River, some 18 km from Dolakha, Charikot, I witnessed a scene that made my blood run cold. On seeing some commotion, curious, I approached the noisy group of locals gathered at the riverbank. Never thought people could stoop so low.
To my horror, they had a live wire strung from the high-voltage transmission line, which they shoved into the water to electrocute the fish. What nerve! Why on earth did they not realise that it was too dangerous and not only kill the fish indiscriminately but take their lives too?
Massive encroachment
“The mahseer is essentially a fish of the rocks, the rapids, and the hills,” wrote A. St. J. Macdonald in his epic book, Circumventing the Mahseer, published in 1948. No words could be truer about the Himalayan gamefish. The more untamed the river, the better is the mahseer run. They hunt and thrive in rough but clear waters with lots of gravel. Silted water proves as their worse nemesis.
What with the country’s infrastructure work at its height from construction of roads, dams to barrages and irrigation weirs, massive quarrying of rocks, gravel and sand from the river bed to natural calamities like landslides (associated with deforestation), all led to the destruction of its natural habitat and disrupted its annual migratory cycle, which is so critical for natural reproduction.
That said, as loss of biodiversity and rapid depletion of natural resources continue, lack of awareness among the riverside fishing community and total government apathy to address the problem, on the other, pose disastrous outcomes for the mahseer and other aquatic species still fighting for survival.
Freshwater monsters
Along with the mahseer, other gamefish like the river monster Goonch catfish (Bagarius yarelli), which have been known to  grow to more than nine feet weighing up to a whopping 50 to 150 kilos, and the snow trout, Asla (Schizothorax macrophthalmus), too, are under threat of extinction if the problem is not timely addressed. The goonch is regarded as a formidable quarry by anglers while fly-fishing for Himalayan snow-trout, a great sport.
The monster-size goonch has a notorious reputation of dragging fishermen into the river and eating them. Jeremy Wade, the British angler, biologist, and writer—better-known as the TV presenter of the wildlife documentary—the River Monsters—toured the world in pursuit of the giant catfish and fished our Mahakali waters in west Nepal, too.
Catch-n-release
Apart from the implementation of conservation measures, awareness among the modern-day anglers and the riverside fishing fraternity is equally important and can effectively work as a stepping stone in saving the aquatic life of our rivers from extinction.
Little-known some two decades ago, catch-and-release among the old-hands and the budding mahseer anglers in Nepal in recent years, have shown some promise for this endangered species. Many Nepali and the visiting foreign anglers to our rivers in Nepal have started releasing their prize-catches.
This conscientious act by the anglers has to some extent sparked off a little curiosity among the local fishing community about the significance of conserving the aquatic life of their rivers. Simple curiosity is followed by an interaction with the anglers and that eventually helps shed light on the fish’s vulnerability and the threatened status to the local people.
Great potential
Given meticulous planning and customised escorted destinations, mahseer angling, as an adventure travel destination in Nepal, can surely make a major breakthrough in travel trade business. Other tour packages like wildlife safari, white water rafting, nature trekking, and bird watching can be mutually supportive, and impart further impetus to such ventures.

“Sport fishing could go a long way in conserving these fish. Anglers not only pay top dollar to land the Mahseer, which has become a legend among anglers, but will also create jobs for the poor. No doubt that protecting stretches of rivers like this is the answer. But the government must be willing,” writes an angler-conservationist, Arun Rana, for Fishing Himalayas, a website dedicated to responsible sport fishing in Nepal.

In recent years, the entry made by fly-fishing mahseer in our waters has gained growing popularity. Fishing golden mahseer on the fly is considered by anglers a bigger challenge than fishing with the conventional tackle, but believe it can match the catch ratio of the latter, no less.

First, a careful study and survey of potential mahseer waters, evaluation of the present status of our watercourses and their resident mahseer runs and informed selection of river stretches least affected by human proximity and poaching are essential.
Emulating the neighbours

Following in the footsteps of our Indian cousins, all angling operations can be managed either from fixed station riverside camps or lodges or by mounting short or long expeditions by river rafting combined with short hikes. Some guidelines to consider:
•Conduct angling trips on a day-by-day basis from established camps or lodges, located near the fishing waters. In Bardiya National Park, several resorts can work as established bases from which to fish the Karnali, Babai, Bheri and Seti rivers. The roadside town of Chisapani can also serve as a base for fishing the upper Karnali and confluences like the Karnali-Bheri and Karnali-Seti.
•Organise expeditions or customised trips with local river guides or river scouts by raft or short treks. Given proper planning, our rivers offer plenty of opportunities, both by raft or short hikes. Many rafting companies can accommodate such a schedule.
Some options are: Dolalghat/Chatara Ghat river rafting with a myriad of tributaries feeding themselves into the Sunkoshi river in the central Nepal hills or short hikes from Mulghat in east Nepal’s Dhankuta district to Tribeni along the river Tamor, or from Maibeni in east Nepal’s Bhojpur district to the confluence of the Pikhuwa and Arun rivers, or from west Nepal’s Bheri-Karnali confluence to Chisapani.
• Combine fishing packages (if close to a national park) diversified by other activities such as nature walks, elephant safaris, birdwatching, village tours, canoe rides, and the lot.

We cannot expect to develop this adventure sport unless we develop in-depth guidelines and a strategy that combines both ‘transplantation and conservation’ to revive these threatened species. It’s high time the concerned authorities took some bold and innovative strategy to save this species from being shoved into oblivion.
Nature at its best
For every visiting angler in pursuit of the awe-inspiring mahseer, there is more to it—not just the fish. The foray kicks off with the sprawling countryside, and from one moment to the next, nature accompanies him with all its bounty.
As a myriad of undulating wooded hills and awesome gorges appears, the rivers rage and crash past breaking into hundreds of churning white rapids and beautiful falls. The visitor is stumped.
As he finds himself smack dab in lush green mountain valleys, the gin-clear spring-fed headwaters meander past him to continue through the verdant subtropical jungles to pour themselves into their big cousins.
Time and again, the remote outback offers incredible sights of wildlife and sounds of nature that greet the untrained ear. Many a village crosses the trail, offering rare moments to share with the local people and observe their unique customs, beliefs and diverse ethnic culture.

And finally, as he casts his line over the swirling water, the master fisherman, the Kingfisher, suddenly swoops down into a blinding flash, spears its tiny prey and flies off. Next, his heart skips a beat as a mugger crocodile breaks the surface to laze on the sandy beach.
And before he knows it, he gawks unbelievingly at a handsome Cheetal stag that approaches the other side of the river for a drink. Sheer bliss!
And all this time the ultimate quest for that elusive “Big One”—“the Mighty Mahseer” of his dream haunts his mind.  Save the Mahseer! Tight lines!

The Himalayan gamefish that rewrote history,"Thursday, August 15, 2019","
Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!
Let’s leaf through the pages of a history book and drift way back to the 1850s, when the British ruled India. The British Raj (1858–1947), they called it. Nobody during those early years of the Raj ever imagined that a fish called the mahseer (mahi- fish and sher- tiger or “tiger among fish” in Persian) would eventually rewrite history.
In 1873, an Englishman, Henry Sullivan Thomas, wrote the book called The Rod in India that dwelled on the natural history of fish, their culture and fishing for mahseer in India. The book became a Bible for the anglers across the globe. In 1948, the book titled Circumventing the Mahseer by Major A. St. J. Macdonald hit the shelves. And it became a ‘Classic.’
History re-written
The more I studied about this wonderful fish, the more my respect and affection grew and my passion for it snowballed into an obsession. I’d like to narrate one short anecdote from the book here, which, eventually, is said to have won this little-known fish the crowning glory across the globe.
During the British Raj in India, a young British officer was deputised to India in the Assam Province. This English gentleman, like many others from his native country, happened to be an avid angler.
After having comfortably settled and reported for duty, this guy started frequenting the officers’ club to chill out the evenings with his native countrymen. One evening, the fellow officers began to discuss fishing.
The newcomer launched himself into blowing his trumpet on his exploits on salmon fishing back home. He seemed a trifle too long-winded. One of the fellow officers cut in on him and asked, “Have you heard about the mahseer that is found in the Indian rivers”?
When his fellow officers filled him in on the native gamefish, the fellow retorted, “What’s mahseer? There’s no match whatsoever to the ‘lordly” salmon when it comes to freshwater fishing,” he snapped back and went on rambling on about the salmon. It’d be like chasing a wild goose to bring him around, the others realised.

A passionate angler as he was, he could not resist himself from trying his hand at fishing. One day, he decided, rather disdainfully, to go fishing to one of the rivers. After something like an hour, he finally got a bite, a big one at that.
A huge 40-pounder mahseer bit his baited hook—and all hell broke loose! The battle ensued. After sweating it out well over an hour, he finally landed the prize fish. Fittingly tamed and cut down to his size by the ferocious fighter, the Englishman from that day onwards never talked about the ‘lordly’ salmon.
The mahseer rewrote history. It became a legend. For the Englishmen, it became the most sought-after gamefish and a hot topic for writing. Books upon books, volumes upon volumes dedicated themselves to this charismatic species.
World fame
Apart from The Rod in India, other epics included The Angler in India or the Mighty Mahseer (1903) by Skene Dhu and The Compleat Indian Angler (2003) by John Masters, among a horde of others. Soon, the fame spread across the globe. Jim Corbett called it ‘the fish of my dreams’ and went on to christen it ‘the tiger of the water’.  Skene Dhu named it the ‘Mighty Mahseer’. In the later years, even films were shot on mahseer-angling.
“Of all the mammoth challenges still facing the world’s fishermen today, mahseer along the Himalayas is one of the greatest. Anyone who goes to the Himalayas and pulls off a fish or two has really recorded a triumph, a place in the history of fishing,” wrote John Bailey (writer, photographer and world-class angler), who also did a documentary film on the Golden Mahseer for the BBC’s Discovery Channel in 1990.
Recently, in 2017, fishinghimalayas.com, organised the filming of the “Fishing Impossible” the BBC Earth TV series. The quest was for the ‘gold’—the Golden Mahseer. The film was shot in the Phewa and Begnas lakes, Pokhara and also extended to the far west Nepal to Babai and the Karnali waters.

Indomitable fighter
Yes, it is unarguably the most ferocious freshwater gamefish in the world. Known to fight like cornered leopards, they exhibit brute power and lightning speed that no other river fish can match.
If hooked, a big mahseer sends shivers down every angler’s spine and even the most accomplished angler is humbled by its unbridled fury. Elusive and notoriously difficult to catch, it’s a daunting challenge that demands immense stamina to travel rugged terrain and face harsh weather conditions. Ultimately, your mind must be trained to revel not only in your success but with untold frustrating failures, too.

A true mahseer angler is the ‘breed’, who, time and again, must frequent that riverbank where he went through many failures and hardship. It’s like the stubborn mountaineer who fails to summit the Everest but doggedly keeps at it no matter what it takes . . . until he is rewarded.
Tackle & gear
The modern day tackle for fishing mahseer includes state-of-the-art reels, high-density carbon or graphite rods, top-of-the-shelf lines and myriad of lures that include the spinners, spoons, jerk-baits, you name it. Some, go for live-baits like minnows and apart from artificial flies, fly-fishers even try live river nymphs.
Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!

The joy and thrill of hooking a big one is so immense that the mahseer angler never tires of relating his experience—the bite, the jerk and the initial rush the brute makes, which can be anything from 100 to 200 yards of your line, as you race along the rocky bank to keep pace with it and finally . . . land it.

Passion bordering on obsession
The book by A. St. J. Macdonald made me ‘take the bait.’ I devoted seven long years to do the study on this species, which took me to a host of rivers stretching from the east to the west of Nepal (read my previous stories).
One of my wanderings to the Koshi in East Nepal to Mai Beni, Baraha Chhetra in 2005 in pursuit of the Golden Mahseer (barbus tor putitora), Pahenle Sahar in Nepali, was the most memorable. I was hung-up on raising a little awareness among the anglers and the local fishing community about the endangered status of the golden mahseer and how to practice conservation methods.
The entire trip to Mai Beni with my fisher friends of Dharan was fraught with a mortal fear that we might, at any time, confront the Maoist activists as the length and breadth of the country was hard hit by Maoist insurgency. Luckily, we did not.
I had not the foggiest idea that my visit caused quite a stir in Mai Beni and Baraha Chhetra. After I was back home in Kathmandu, my Dharan friends called me to say that the Maoist cadres made inquiries about the city-slicker (yours truly), who had the nerve to mislead the riverside fishing community by asking them to release their catches, which meant virtually the same as forgoing their bread and butter. They’d completely misjudged my intentions.
Home for mahseer
Nepal, under the shadows of the Himalayas, is a maze of rivers, snow-fed and spring-fed, flowing down south into the Ganges, India. Many of these rivers are home to the legendary mahseer including the most-coveted Himalayan Golden Mahseer—considered the ‘icing on the cake’ by anglers.
Our rivers like the Karnali, Bheri, Seti, Mahakali, Narayani and the Mighty Koshi with her seven tributaries hold this species in bountiful supply.
Fishing for mahseer has been an age-old custom among the fishing community of Nepal. If it means bread and butter for them, for other local aficionados, it serves as a great recreational sport. As the access to modern-day tackle for most is still off-limit, they still resort today to the primitive crude methods.
My angling tours to the Sapta Koshi, Arun, Tammar, Sun Koshi and Tama Koshi rivers in the east and the Karnali, Trishuli and Babai in the west revealed many big mahseer catches from 10 to 35 kilos made by the local riverside community. Most of such catches were made on thapuwa balchhi―hooks baited with live fish cast at night and retrieved in the morning. Such catches also included Goonch catfish, which can grow to monster sizes and are found in our rivers, both the east and the west.
The primitive method of fishing days are long past for the present-day fishers. It has been replaced by modern fishing tackle and hardware with futuristic reels and latter-day rods, hooks, lures and line.

Migratory run
Mahseer is a migratory cold water fish that inhabits rivers and lakes that have inlets and outlets to a river. It spawns during monsoon floods (June-September). Much the same as the salmon travels hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, the mahseer ascents up-river to considerable heights (from as low as 300 ft. to 2,500ft from sea level), to placid spring-fed feeder streams, to spawn and deposit their eggs.
After the monsoon they return to the foothills, then migrate back again to the upper reaches to breed where there are many snow and glacier-fed rivers—the mahseers’ natural habitat. It is called the migratory run.
During my fishing trip to Mai Beni, my veteran fisher friends had their own way of drawing their views about the migration run.  “When the Brahimini ducks or the Ruddy Shelducks were sighted taking to their wings from the riverbanks and the Koshi revealed schools of  minnows darting upriver literally between our knees in the clear water, we knew the mahseers were on their migratory run,” said Bharat Sunuwar, one of my fisher friends from Dharan.
That was not something my fisher friends learned from a book but from nuances of long experience at the river. I called it the ‘river lore’.

Remeasuring Everest: How far is the ‘new’ height announcement?,"Thursday, August 8, 2019","On May 22, officials from the Survey Department summited Everest and, in doing so, completed the most complex part the Everest Measurement Programme. Many at the time had felt that with that people would now know the exact height of the highest mountain in the world; however, that was not the case.
According to Susheel Dangol Chief Survey Officer and Coordinator of the Mount Everest Height Measurement Programme, the expedition to Everest represented only 20 per cent of the work needed to remeasure the height of the mountain, which is believed to have been altered by the 2015 earthquake. “Many people thought that climbing Everest meant that measurement was complete but that was only a fraction of the work.”
He said that the survey department was using both conventional surveying techniques similar to those used by George Everest (who surveyed Mount Everest in the 19th century) and a modern geoid system to measure its height. “We’re using trigonometry system along with precise levelling, gravity survey and GNSS system. We are using both traditional and modern methods to ensure there are no controversies,” he adds.
The trigonometry and precise levelling method
Under the trigonometry method, the department selected 12 points such as Laure Danda, Mayam, Patle Danda, Chhulyamu, Sollung, Namche, Kala Patthar, from where Everest could be observed. They used simple maths to measure the height of the mountain using the Pythagorean theorem. This was also the same system that the Indians used to measure the height of Everest in the late 2000s. Observations have already been recorded from all 12 points, says Dangol.
Under precise levelling, the department then aimed to calculate the altitude of each of the 12 points with respect to the sea-level. As Nepal does not have a sea, officials had to rely on similar measurements carried out by India surveyors to measure the altitude of the Jayanagar point near the border with Nepal. This was possible as Indian officials had already carried out precise levelling for the Jayanagar point with respect to the closest sea in India.
“This added verification was needed because we wanted to verify that the points on which we would carry out the trigonometric calculations had not changed because of the quake. This method is quite accurate but it is time-consuming. We can only measure 25 metres at a time and that had to be done from the Jayanagar in India to Phaplu in Solukhumbu.” The department took nearly six months to reach Phaplu from Jayanagar. The process is now complete.
Gravity Survey and GNSS method
The Gravity Survey and GNSS method is a far more rigorous and accurate way of measuring the height of a landmark with respect to the sea-level. Experts from New Zealand suggested that the department implement this method. “The two methods were used by the Chinese when they measured Everest from their side. As we were also told to do a geoid survey, we had to use both Gravity Survey and GNSS method. This will help us get the exact height of Everest from sea level.”
For that, the department set up 297 points across a 100 km radius around 12 districts in the Solukhumbu area.
A Gravity Survey is an indirect (surface) means of calculating the density property of subsurface materials. The higher the gravity values, the denser the rock beneath.
“We set up around 297 points to do this survey. Frist, we started in the high Himalayas and then the rest of the places. As we only had one gravimeter this took time.”
The basic concept behind GNSS survey is to investigate variation (gravity anomalies) in the Earth’s gravitational field generated by differences of density between subsurface rocks. “Geoid in layman’s term is the shape that the ocean surface would take under the influence of the gravity and rotation of the earth alone if other influences such as winds and tides were absent.”
He said it will be calculated after collection of gravity data obtained from GNSS and gravity survey.
Dangol adds that the GNSS survey has been completed for all 297 points. However, gravity survey for some of those points is yet to be carried out as the department only has one gravimeter.
“For the gravity survey, we need to visit each and every site and take a reading. We’ve done the gravity survey of 119 points and will soon begin work on the remaining 178 points after the monsoon.” Dangol added that they could not go to these point as most of them were located on hills where the roads are inaccessible during the rainy season.
“Taking the helicopter sounds easy but it is full of risks. You need to make sure that everything is right or else things can go really bad.”
The best thing to come out of this project, Dangol says, is that officials working at the survey department learned a lot of new things. “Yes we are measuring Everest, but there is more to this project than that. We’ve set up around 300 points in various parts of the region which will be beneficial in the long run. These points can be used for other surveys for making roads or planning any other projects in the area.”
Dangol says that the project has also improved the officials’ capacity. “This is something that needs to be done all over Nepal. The training we’ve received during this project has been immense. We had no idea about so many things, take the gravity and the GNSS surveys for example. But after this project is done, I believe that we can do replicate this surveys anywhere in Nepal.” The team also learnt about how temperature and humidity affect measurement.
Now the survey department is sending most of the members of the team working on the measurement to Denmark to learn how to calculate geoids. “Until now all the geoid work done in Nepal was by foreigners. Now it will be done by Nepalis.”
The project officially kicked off at the beginning of 2018 is likely to end in December of 2019. Dangol shares that it will take around two months to map out the 178 remaining points after which they will be able to calculate the height of the mountain. Then the department will have the data to announce the ‘new’ height of the mountain.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/remeasuring-everest-how-far-is-the-new-height-announcement.html,travel
Monsoon musings of an avid angler,"Friday, July 26, 2019","
The monsoon is upon us. No word sounded lovelier when in mid-June the vast sky opened up and slaked the parched ashy-grey cityscape generously with the rains after the long spell of fierce heat the metropolis dished out during the last week of May.
It came belatedly, only on the 20th of June as against the normal onset time, the 10th of June. First arrived the gentle showers in fine droplets, but as the days went by—as unpredictable as they could get—turned into downpours followed by battering cloudbursts.

You can never tell when they appear or stop as quickly as they started, and without so much as a whisper pick up where they left off. Come monsoon, the heavens open up as they say it.
I saw it for the last 66 years, will continue to do so; so did my forbears in the same spirit; so will you, and your posterity . . . and theirs. Folks, like it or lump it, you have to learn to live with it simply because it’s the monsoon.
Green at its best
Yes, look around and you’ll find it green all around you—the countryside, the suburbs, the lush paddy fields and the forested hills that stand out clear as the rains wash the murky smog off. And this is the time of the year when the rains help to scour our rivers clean of the appalling pile-up of filth. I, for one, sit on my patio and watch my tiny garden grow greener, as it were, challenging the emeralds. My eyes stray from one plant to another seemingly jostling with each other to grow faster and greener, the creepers reaching for the sky, and the flowers vying for my attention.
Curiously, even the grass on my lawn seems to race against the clock in its bid to turn greener and lusher! And my little cairn sits in the corner looking awesome (took a lot of effort for me to stack them). I sit quietly and try to soak everything in. Lo and behold, even my turtle seems to enjoy it! Suddenly, I hear the crack of thunder and soon the rains arrive. I proudly look at my garden and ask myself: “Isn’t it green at its best?”

Gosh! That unmistakable scent as the raindrops meet the soil on the flower beds, the lawn, and the flowerpots! I just love it. Earthy, fresh—but what else—musky, pungent . . . ? My olfactory dictionary lacks the word to describe it.
When the raindrops hit the dust or clay soil, they trap tiny air bubbles on the surface, which subsequently shoot upward–redolent of a glass of champagne—bursts, and then like an aerosol sprays out that bizarre fragrance. Science says: it is petrichor.
Jogging memories
Yes! As I sit back on my patio watching the rains, old memories come flooding by—some are sweet, some not-so-sweet, others bitter closely followed by past incidents that make for amusing anecdotes to look back on . . . and live them. I call them my monsoon escapades. One particular occurrence that took place some eight years ago in the lake-city Pokhara still feels like only yesterday. For that, we will have to travel back in time. Shall we?
Angling in Fewa

I’m nuts about fishing. Whether ponds, rivers, reservoirs or lakes, they draw me like the bees to the honeypot. Big lake, bigger bags, I thought excitedly when I arrived in Pokhara.
I hired a boat at the Fewa lakeside and set out with a local guy feeling high as a kite when I learned that he was an old hand at the game. My fishing guide suggested that we picked one of the isolated spots on the opposite bank to give a wide berth to scores of boaters that crowded the lake. Perfect, I said to myself.



The morning looked promising—a clear sky sans the monsoon clouds as we headed across the emerald-green water of Lake Fewa armed to the teeth with our fishing tackles. The lake holds gamefish such as rohu (Asian wild carp), common carp, catla (Asian carp), tilapia and bighead, among others.

The thought that I might run into a Golden Mahseer (highly prized by avid anglers) or two fired my imagination. Our small two-man boat made it to the opposite bank before we knew it. It seemed my fisher friend was good at paddling too.
We lost no time. Honestly, I could not wait to cast my line. I beamed happily to find no soul around the spot at the early hour. The water calm and beckoning. The forested foothill rose high up behind our backs. Save for the sound of the ebb and flow of the water that slapped against the sandy bank and receded like clockwork, the total hush felt almost spooky.
The cool crisp morning felt invigorating. The musty, earthy smell of the lake waters felt gratifying while the wooded hills reminded me of being in the lap of nature. “This is total bliss,” I thought aloud.
For bait, we had a mix of chicken feed and refined flour kneaded into a fine dough. Man, did it smell awful! My partner told me that he’d added a dash of tongba (a light local-beer made from fermented millet) sediment. This fish-bait concoction was Pokhara’s local favorite.
Apart from it, my partner fished out something from a plastic bag. It was cow (buffalo?) dung! To my great disgust, he made them into balls with his bare hand and wrapped up the baited hook with it. Ugh! When I asked why the dung, he said that the smell lured the fish. I’d done a lot of fishing but that came as a total surprise. Later, I learned that to be a common practice among fishers in Pokhara.
The fishing began. With bated breath, I hurled my first line weighed down by the wonder dough, then another. So did my partner—four rods in total. All we had to do then was lie back and wait with an eye on the tip of the rod for a tug from the fish . . . and, of course, our fingers crossed. Fishing means waiting it out, which could be hours without flinching a muscle. I regretted not having brought a book to kill time.
Total blank
The waiting seemed truly excruciating as the morning drew closer to noon. In between the time, we changed our baits and switched the cast-spots. Except for feeble bites, not worth a jerk at the line, we kept in wait, pinning our hopes on a big catch. Time for lunch, my partner announced. He’d brought big fat tuna sandwiches that made my mouth water.
After three in the afternoon, I began to despair. No bites, whatsoever! On the other hand, my partner fumed and cursed. “Preposterous,” he blurted out, his frustration written all over his face. “This has never happened before,” he lamented loudly.
Later, my partner seemed to fuss about as he changed our hooks, added a little more of the smelly tongba to the dough and asked me to move farther along to our right. Practically, he did everything going by the book. I stayed quiet trying not to let my disappointment show.
For me, the improved bait, the rejigging of the hooks and the change of spot brought high hopes. I cast my line with renewed energy, the suspense killing me. Suddenly, at around four in the afternoon, the weather seemed to take a mood-swing as low-hanging dark clouds drifted in over the lake. The bag remained at naught.
Disaster struck
And to confirm my fears, the sky rumbled and a bolt of lightning snaked through the air. Time, we called it a day, I thought. Fishing during thunder lightning is dangerous as the fishing rods, normally made of graphite or carbon-fiber, act as good conductors and may add to the risk of a lightning strike.
That was about it all. Resignedly, we hurriedly packed our gear and prepared to leave lest the rains beat us to it. I felt the first droplets on my cheeks even before we started. Before long, they turned into larger drops sounding the warning bells. Then, all hell broke loose before we could gather our wits!
Hardly had we paddled 50 yards than it began pouring, soon replaced by a cloudburst that tore down at us in torrents. We could hardly see five feet beyond the bow through the sheets of rain. That scared the pants off of me. It did not end at that. Damn!
Our luck seemed to run out on us. Suddenly, the high drama took another twist and we were out of the frying pan into the fire. The small boat started filling up with the rainwater. Soon, it rose to a dangerous level of the hull. As my partner furiously worked the paddles, I frantically bailed the water out with the small bucket that previously carried the fish bait.
Close shave
I started shivering. The rains brought in a chillness to the air. I think it was both fear and the chill that did it when it suddenly struck me that I did not know how to swim. As my companion dug in deep with the paddles, I feverishly kept at hurling the water out, the rain almost blinding my vision. Did I pray too? I do not remember . . . I must have. Suddenly, a question flashed across my mind. Are we going to capsize and sink?
After what appeared like a half-hour, the dreadful ordeal ended. The rain fell back to a light shower. I still shook uncontrollably as we made it to the opposite bank. I eventually sighed in relief. Suddenly it dawned on me that I’d be celebrating my forthcoming birthday. Phew!
As I finished writing, the sky again opened up for the rains. Folks, its monsoon time!

Hiking the Tarkeshswor shrine,"Tuesday, July 16, 2019","
Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.
I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’
While doing frequent cycling jaunts on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé route north-west of the Kathmandu valley rim, I’d instinctively look up to my north at the towering forested hills above Jitpur Phedi, my eyes glued to the breach on the sheer craggy height. It literally beckoned.
That crack on the naked rock-face, the local folks say, is the Tarkeshwor Mahadev shrine. For years, I longed to go there, but never got around to it. Someday . . . I’d keep telling myself. And the day did come on the last week of June 2019.
For mountain bikers, the two-and-a-half-hour round trip on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé circuit, first on a paved road and later a dirt road past quaint little village-towns like Jitpur Phedi, Kabhresthali, and Sanglé promises a decent cross-country spin.

The track offers both modest up-hills and rock-strewn down-hills to thrill the mountain biking buffs including the “bikeoholics” (mountain biking limbo meaning hardcore riders) to while away their weekend mornings.  Small wonder, it has become a popular haunt for all the bikers.
Hiking not biking
This time, the trip happened to be a hike and not a ride on my bicycle. There were five of us –Shayeet, my cycling partner, his mother, Shalu, my wife, Radhika, I and a teenager guest from Bangladesh, Adriana. A first cousin to Shayeet, she was in Kathmandu for her holiday.  We made quite a mixed bunch, old, not-very-old and kids in their teens!
None of us had been to the place before, so no one knew the route.  A quick look on the Internet helped me. We decided on a ride to Teen Piplé and then hike from there (buses ply on the road as it happens to be the Trishuli Highway with beautiful hill-towns like Kakani and Rani Pauwa en route). We did not catch a bus but drove instead, a 45-minute ride, in my car.
Wavering start
As the Internet did not have enough info on the place, things like distance, villages on the track, teahouses and the like, we thought it best to pack our lunch. Later, we found that we had figured it right.
As we planned to leave after breakfast, we prepared the food the previous night. With rain-jackets, umbrellas, water bottles, and, whatnots taken care of, we were all set to backpack it to Tarkeshwor the next day.
Come the next day, and I awoke to a sudden thrumming, which soon turned into a familiar pelting sound. Oh, no–the rain! I cursed. I always love the sound of the rain drumming on the windows and the floor outside my patio.  But never did I hate the rains so much than that particular morning. At first, it was just a light pitter-patter, but soon it started pouring.
“There goes our trip down the drain,” I hollered. Hoping for the impossible to happen, Radhika and I helped ourselves with breakfast.  More likely than not, the rest of the group, our close neighbors, was going through the same plight.
The rain, lo and behold, suddenly showed the signs of letting up. Miraculously, it stopped. A little later the sun started peeking in through the clouds.  Radhika’s phone rang, and the group made a hurried appearance. Time to move; everyone piled into the car and I took the wheel.
The winding drive past Mudkhu Bhanjhyang with the towering Nagarjun hill blanketed with the dense forest was a sight for sore eyes after the unsightly urban sprawl and the traffic snarl at the busy Ring Road. The paved road until Osho Tapoban, the Rajneesh Meditation Centre, was fairly good.
Because of muddy stretches, the onward driving got tricky and slowed down almost to a crawl.  It bothered me that we might get caught out on the thick muck as the road was riddled with frequent muddy puddles, and deep ruts, which never seemed to end. Phew! To my great relief, we finally made it to Teen Piplé, the kick-off point for our hike.
The Hike

After parking our car at Teen Piplé, we picked up a few tips about the trail from the locals and hit the country pathway.  As I could foretell, some said it would take an hour; others put it at a little over two hours. That’s how it is in the villages. Ten minutes can be a half-hour and an hour nothing less than two hours.
The ladies were spared the lugging as Shayeet and I volunteered to carry the backpacks with our food and other stuffs. “Whoa!” That came off Radhika. The long flight of steps right from the start looked intimidating.  As it turned out, the trail seemed to be interspersed with dirt paths that made it easier for Radhika (she has a knee problem).
Panch Mané

The trail continued uphill with scattered houses and cultivated lands amidst the country landscape. The hillside appeared green with sparse woodland, extensive spread of lush maize-crops and vegetables growing in small patches adjoining the houses. As we huffed it uphill, a little before the town of Panch Mané, our eyes met an impressive sight.

At first sight, we took it for a gompa(monastery) as the hills of the Kathmandu Valley rim are dotted with them. On cresting the ridge, it, however, turned out to be a Hindu shrine, the Bhuwaneswori Temple. Goddess Bhuwaneswori is none other than goddesses Bhagwati or Durga and revered as a manifestation of the formidable Kali Mata, too.

The multi-tiered pagoda-shaped temple with overhanging eaves and the roofs finished in golden colour stood high from the ground lending a dignified look. A long flight of steps led to the entrance.  A young pujari (priest) led us in for the darshan (homage). As expected, no photography was allowed.
After the darshan, to our great surprise, the pujari offered a plate of Prasad (devotional offer of food) to each of us, which included fresh-fried puri, haluwa (kind of sweet made out of semolina) and potato curry. That mightily impressed us all. Starved as I was, I was tempted to go for a second helping, but checked myself.
“The temple was built some seven years back by Shyam Baba but the building was razed to the ground in the 2015 earthquake. The baba, who is also a great scholar, took the pains to rebuild it after the earthquake,” informed the young priest. A number of small pagoda-style houses in the foreground of the main temple, he said, were Baba’s living quarters.

“Devotees throng the temple twice every year to observe Navratri, once in summer (Ram Nawami/Chait-dashain) and again at the onset of winter during Vijaya Dashami or dashain,” the young priest added.

The trail then climbed again and met with a dirt road that led to the Panch Mané village. The cluster of houses lining the road also included a homestay.  As we continued along the road, our eyes caught sight of a number of round brick structures, three to be exact, which appeared like water storage tanks. They were not.

“They are historic Manés (homogeneous to Buddhist stupas), which date back to the times of Prithvi Narayan Shah. This village is in fact named after those manés, “said Bijay Aryal, a local guy I happened to run into.
“During those days, there were four entry points into the Kathmandu Valley and Panch Mané happened to be one of them. Going by history, while stationed at Panch Mané, King Prithvi  Narayan Shah contemplated the invasion of the then Valley of Nepal(Kathmandu, Bhadgaon, and Lalitpur),” he further added.
“Before the devastating earthquake of 2015, there were five of them, thus, the name Panch(five) Mané. Two of them were swept away in a landslip following the earthquake,” Bijay further explained.
After a cup of tea at a local teashop and a brief respite, we resumed our hike. The dirt road ended at a wooded foothill and turned into a narrow foot trail. With no habitation and not a soul around the trail climbed through tall pine trees and brush.
Shortly, the stone steps appeared, and Radhika broke into one of her vociferous protests (she did that during our last hike to Bishnudwar in the Shivapuri heights, too). Howsoever grumbling she did on such hikes, she loves it in all reality. She is plucky, all right!
The rest of us were doing good. Only Adriana seemed breathless and looked tired. She told me that she had never done a tough hike like that before and never been to that high an elevation. She came from Dhaka, an elevation of just four meters from the sea-level and with no hill whatsoever in sight.

And there she was slogging it up a steep hill doing above 1,700m from the sea-level! Great work, I said to the brave girl from Dhaka. She smiled back and said that she was really enjoying it, and that she will have quite a story to tell her friends back home.

The forest
The trail got steeper and wound up through the thick forest. We came across a board that declared we were within the Shivapuri National Park. As we gained elevation, the tall pines were replaced by the deciduous broad-leaved forest, both temperate and sub-tropical. Surprisingly, the trail remained hushed with no one in sight. The only sound we could hear was the faint call of the birds and the wild crickets.
Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.

I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’
The Shrine

After something like an hour on the trail uphill, we spotted a metal step ladder leaned against a sheer rock face with overhanging undergrowth.  We had finally made it to the Tarkeshwor Mahadev. The height commanded a birds-eye-view of the valley–once pristine and verdant some three decades ago now looking pathetic enveloped in filthy haze and smog.

The main shrine in two storeys seemed carved into a solid huge boulder looking like an alcove with a sheer drop to its south. A stone Shivalinga with four faces (mukhalinga) sat in the far corner and a stone Nandi (sacred bull calf), a vehicle and gatekeeper of Lord Shiva, stood sentinel in the foreground. A small pit next to the entrance held a little stagnant water. In fact, it was not.

“The water in that pit is from the sacred lake in the Himalayas, the Gosaikunda (4,380m). The water drains into it perennially,” said Baba Shrinath, the only mortal we met on the hike. A flight of metal steps went up to a narrow rocky overhang in the upper storey, which housed metal bells and a trident.

“The Tarkeshwor Mahadev is said to have surfaced at the present site in the Satyayug (Golden Age; the first-ever epoch on earth) when one of the lifeless limbs of Lord Shiva’s first consort, Goddess Sati Devi’s right limb fell off at the spot,” the Baba shed light on it by recounting one of the mythological accounts from the Swasthani Brata Katha .
“The Gosaikunda water began draining into the pit as a result of deep-seated tapasya (spiritual deep meditation, an exercise in austerity, and self-discipline) performed by yogis (saints) from the Satyayug,” the baba further added. He has been residing at the Tarkeshwor site for the last 25 years.

I was so famished that I could eat a horse, so were the others. We wolfed down our packed lunch of home-cooked chicken biryani and matar paneer, rested a bit and then backtracked down the hill. At Panch Mané, we came across an open truck parked beside a teashop. We asked the driver if we could hitch a ride up to Teen Piplé. It was a big yes.
Radhika seemed the happiest as the way back still meant coping with a long flight of knee-buckling steps down to Teen Piplé (going down-steps hurts the knees more for those with the problem).  Frankly, I was too, for I was spared her screaming bloody murder at me.

‘I won’t climb Everest’,"Sunday, June 30, 2019","

"Mingma Dorchi Sherpa: When you climb for long time, you want to do things to be remembered","Monday, June 24, 2019","
Mingma Dorchi Sherpa, like many high-altitude climbers, started his career as a porter. Like his peers, he too slowly made a name for himself in the mountaineering sector and established his own expedition company. But having summited various 8000-ers 17 times, he still yearned for something more.
“When you climb for a long time, you want to do something memorable,” he says.
That is why before going to Everest for the fifth time, he gave himself a challenge. The challenge was to summit Everest and Lhotse in record time. “Having taken so many people to the summit, and helping them break records, I too wanted to create one.”

But he knew this challenge wasn’t going to be easy. The record for the fastest summit of Everest-Lhotse was 10 hours and 15 minutes set by Nirmal Purja Magar in 2017. “I knew it was going to be tough. I was also going for another one: climbing Everest, Lhotse, and Makalu in under five days.”
However, before thinking about Makalu, he had two mighty mountains to tackle. The Everest-Lhotse traverse is attempted by many climbers, however, only a few make it to both the summits. This year the government handed out a record 381 permits to climbers seeking to scale Everest, and this would make Mingma Dorchi’s mission all the more difficult.
“I knew that the number was going to be a problem. My company had a fair share of climbers as well.”
But that did not deter him from his goal. Mingma Dorchi kept rotating camps on a regular basis to make sure that his clients were safe and in good spirit. But the weather was making it difficult for him as mountaineers only had three proper weather windows. First on May 15, second on May 21 and third on May 27.
“Most of my clients summited by May 21. I waited because I wanted to break the record, I needed the mountain with fewer people. This is why I summited at the end of the climbing season.” Having waited for a proper weather window, Mingma Dorchi knew it was now or never. With the weather still unpredictable, he set off with his headlamp all on his own on May 26 around 7 pm.
“There were a few people climbing along, but I was on a mission to do this as fast as possible.”
Climbing all by himself, he reached the summit of Everest at 12:45 am on May 27. He was so far in front of other climbers that he had to click a picture of his summit himself. “When I reached the top I had to click a picture. But it was dark and I didn’t have a good camera but I still took a selfie and using by headlamp and also shot videos as proof that I had made it.”
After spending a few minutes at the summit, Mingma Dorchi then started his descent towards Camp 3 from where he would his Lhotse accent. “I spent a few minutes at the summit then rushed down to Camp IV filled up water then was on the way down to Camp III.”

From Camp III he started his push. He says he didn’t check the time at Camp III because he didn’t want to be distracted from the cause. After resting at Camp III for a brief period he was up and running for his Lhotse push. Mingma Dorchi reached the top of Lhotse at 6:45 am on May 27 creating a record in the process. “Obviously I was very happy. Not only did I break the previous record I nearly halved it,” he says.
But that was not it. He was gunning for another speed record. And after clicking pictures and videos for proof, he started his descent as he had to catch a chopper which would drop him to Makalu Base Camp. “I had something to eat at Camp II and left for basecamp to catch me chopper.”
He left on the chopper to Makalu Base Camp along with North Face athlete of the year Dawa Yonzon who he would be climbing Makalu with. “I spent 17 hours at Makalu Base Camp to prep for this summit and on May 28 at around 9 am left basecamp.” After toiling for around 22 hours Mingma Dorchi finally reached the summit of Makalu on May 29 around 7 am. After clicking pictures he rushed down towards base camp. “I came further down from base camp to the trekking route.”
It was there that he found out that he hadn’t managed to create the speed record of climbing three summits in less than five days as Nirmal Purja Magar on May ­­­22 had bettered his own record of five days by completing it in little over 48 hours.
“I’d be lying if I told you I wasn’t gutted. It was tough when I found out because had I not spent 17 hours in Makalu Base Camp, I think I would set that record under my name.” He says that he is waiting for certificates, after which he will start his process to get officially registered with the Guinness Book of World Records.
“To make sure there are no confusions, I also have GPS proof which shows me at the summits of the mountains at specific times.” Mingma Dorchi after this wants to create more records. He’s left for Pakistan to tackle the second tallest mountain K2 and Broad Peak. But he says he also wishes to climb Gasherbrum 1 and 2.
“I want to set some records there as well. If possible, I want to climb K2 twice or climb all four mountains consecutively.” He says he will not stop after that. He wants to attempt even more records and also wants to climb new routes on some 8000-ers. “I want to leave a mark on this industry.”

Man who clicked Everest traffic jam picture might have to abandon his ‘project’ due to lack of funds,"Wednesday, May 29, 2019","The first thing you notice about Nirmal Purja Magar (or ‘Nims‘ ) is that he is incredibly confident. Why wouldn’t he be? He’s climbed Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in 31 days and particpated in two hi-altitude rescues. In addition to that, he’s the climber who clicked the now viral ‘Everest Traffic Jam’ photo.
However, the future of Project Possible (the reason why he’s climbed the six mountains) looks bleak. The former UK Special Boat Service officer, who aims to summit all fourteen 8,000m peaks in one season, doesn’t have funds to complete the Phase 2 of his project under which he plans to climb five mountains in Pakistan and Phase 3 under which he plans to summit two more mountains in Nepal and one in China.
“I went through a lot to ensure that Phase 1 was successful. I had to re-mortgage my house, emptied my savings and found corporate sponsors. Through this I have shown people that I could do what many thought wasn’t possible. However, if I want to complete Phase 2 and 3 I will need more help,” he says speaking at a press conference in Kathmandu.
Magar says he decided to kick-start Project Possible in 2017 after summiting Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in five days. “I still had more in the tank. I knew I could do much more. But when I asked renowned mountaineers if they felt that my project would be possible, many laughed at me telling me I was crazy.”
Through the project Magar wants to deliver a message of hope to the people of the world. “I want to show the world that dreams come true if you work hard enough for it. If you are focused, things will definitely come true,” he adds.
He says he is also climbing to show people climate change is real. “When I climbed Ama Dabalam in 2014, there was so much snow on the mountain, but fast forward to 2018, we had to take gallons of water to cook as the mountain did not have enough snow.”
Another reason he wants to do it is because he feels he’s the only one who can do it.
“People might think that my ego is quite big. But if others could have done this they already would have. Six mountains in 31 days is no joke. I’ve proved my self and I believe that only I could have done it.”
But this is not just about ‘personal triumphs’. Magar is doing this challenge to begin a lifelong mission to support two charities close to his heart: The Special Boat Service Association and ‘ChoraChori’, a charity that rescues Nepali children from prison and slavery.
The fascination of climbing the 8000-ers started when Italian alpinist Reinhold Messner finished it in 1986 16-years after he took on the challenge. Messner and others after him believed that the method of climbing was more important than getting to the top. But Magar believes otherwise. For him, getting to the top is what matters.
Magar after posting about his project on social media received messages on social media challenging him to do it without bottled oxygen. “They really pissed me off. Which is why I wanted to do it without O2, but my climbing partner Mingma David Sherpa told me that if I wanted to lead an expedition I had to carry O2. Not for me but for others who might need it in the mountain.”
That is exactly what happened in Annapurna and Kanchenjunga.
After getting to the top of Annapurna and getting back to Camp 4, they found out that Singapore-based doctor Wui Kin Chin, who was attempting to climb the mountain with his team, went missing. But even without support from insurance agencies, Magar and his team, who hurried their way to Base Camp, flew back to Camp 3 to try to save Chin.
“On summit day it had taken us 18 hours to get to where Kin was, but when we came back, we did it in four hours. If he was alive, we had to do everything in our power to save him and we did bring him down successfully. But sadly he did not make it.”
Magar and Sherpa were then involved in another rescue after summiting Kanchenjunga. While descending, they saw an Indian climber Biplav Baidya struggle along with his guide. Without thinking twice, Magar and Sherpa gave them their backup oxygen and helped bring them down to Camp 4.
On the way down they met another Indian climber who had collapsed. Kuntal Karar had also run out of oxygen and had been abandoned at 8,400m. Magar gave him his own oxygen and called for help. However, no one came. And both died a few 100 meters from Camp 4.
“If I didn’t have oxygen I wouldn’t have been able to help them. I carry it to use it in emergencies and to help people. While I was angry before, now I realise that there was no point trying to impress people. If carrying oxygen can save lives I will always carry one with me.”
Having climbed three tricky mountains in three weeks, Magar then broke his own record by climbing Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in little over 48 hours.
“It would have been quicker if not for the traffic jam. I would have definitely broken my record of the Everest/Lhotse traverse.”
But now he is worried. Worried that the next phase might not happen.

While many people get six-figure sums to climb one 8000m peak, Magar hasn’t received the same support. That might be understandable because people often spend years of relationship building to get funding.
“I still need around $500,000 to complete project possible. And without people’s support I cant do it,” he says urging people to help hims through his go fund me page.
When asked if the governments of Nepal or the UK have acknowledged his feat, he says he hasn’t heard anything from both parties. “It is like they don’t care,” he says.
Magar, as of now, has proved he can do this. But he says the future of the project depends on the funding and that he has no plans of extending the project.
“The project isn’t going to be extended. You only go for one mission and that is my mission. I’ve been giving a 100 per cent and that is what matters.  If I can’t finish this project I won’t be disappointed. I’ll just put my focus on something else.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/man-who-clicked-everest-traffic-jam-picture-might-have-to-abandon-his-project-due-to-lack-of-funds.html,travel
Danda Gaon: The getaway that feels so near yet so far from Kathmandu,"Tuesday, May 21, 2019","Yes, if you go to Danda Gaon and peer over the wooded hillside to your south, the sprawling valley appears literally at a stone’s throw distance. But the proximity to a pristine forest, the towering Shivapuri peak and the quiet moments spent with nature and her bounties leave you with the impression that you have come a great distance.
For Kathmanduites, weekends mean a lot. You feel like spending the once-in-a-week break somewhere, anywhere . . . not very far off to escape from the daily drudgery; the claustrophobic urban jungle; the hive of frenzied activity; the impossible traffic gridlock; the dust and emission, the almighty swell of humanity and a city drowned in a cacophony of sound and nasty stench.

Picnic spots
If it’s a picnic, it could be the same old spots such as Godavari, Nagarkot, Gokarna, Bajrabarahi, which have remained for long the popular jaunts or for that matter, the Zoo at Jawalahel. On the other hand, you may wish to spend your time on quiet family outings. Danda Gaon is one such destination, which promises to be a lovely picnic spot on weekends–or if you fancy a quiet outing on weekdays.
If you have tried Danda Gaon(1,800m), you are among those fortunate ones who like to try newer spots, close to nature. If you have not, it’s just the place, the kind that often haunts your imagination–someplace new, someplace different . . . to breathe in the fresh air, to smell the woods, the pollen, the grass, and the earth!
Access to Danda Gaun is a breeze, and the distance short–a piddling 12km from Narayan Gopal Chowk (6.5km from Budalinkantha bus park) and with no traffic hassle. You can make it in less than a half hour from Narayan Gopal Chowk if you travel by car. And the road is paved all the way into the bargain.
The only downside is that no public transports ply between Budanilkantha and the wooded height of Danda Gaon. That, I suppose, is not much of a problem because most of you own a vehicle, one kind or the other. You can hire a cab if it comes to that.
Hike or bike

If not, maybe it’s not a bad idea footing it to the place from Budanilkantha Chowk (buses and ‘micros’ shuttle to the busy intersection from Ratna Park). Lots of people do, just for the fun of it. It will take you a little over a one-half hour–can be fun if you are with your friends as you huff it uphill through a quiet beautiful forest.
I bet it will give you the much-needed stretch to your legs, as you will have hiked six kilometers by the time you reach the place . . . surely breaking a real good sweat.
Shayeet (my cycling companion) and I, pedaled to the spot on our mountain bikes. We chose the road via the ancient town of Tokha and headed north to Chandeswori, an old Hindu shrine located at the base of a wooded hill. Considered a “shakti peeth,” the Chandeswori shrine draws a large crowd of devotees on certain festivals including the Dashain. A large statue of Goddess Kali also occupies the temple premises.
Next to the temple, an off-road path forks to the right and climbs up the side of the wooded hill with small settlements on the way. After something like one-half kilometers on the stiff climb, the off-road meets the paved motor-road from Budhalinkantha that goes to Danda Gaon.
For cyclists, the climb offers a real challenge puffing and blowing up the quiet wooded hill. The return trip is a treat for the mountain bikers as it’s downhill all the way–sheer adrenalin pumping   “shredding” either way you choose it, through the Budanilkantha town or the Chandeswori route. Motorbikers, on the other hand, can enjoy the ride no less.
Danda Gaun has to offer more. Apart from a one-day outing, you can even extend it to a one-night retreat. The hilltop has a number of resorts such as the Danda Gaon Jungle Resort, the Green Valley Resort and a couple of others.
National Park
After half a kilometer from Budanilkantha Chowk, the straight wide road through the bazaar area crosses a bridge over the Bishnumati River, narrows, and starts climbing towards the wooded hills.  Before the forest begins, a sign at a bend pointing upward reads Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park.
With no habitation and shops the rest of the way, the road winds up through a beautiful forest, dense, quiet and undisturbed. The jungle is so thick at places that the sun can hardly penetrate the dense canopy.
After around two-and-a-half kilometers on the uphill flanked by dense wood, you arrive at a sentry post manned by military personnel; nothing to get alarmed about it, though.  You are at the entry point to the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park. You need to check in, register your name and if your outing extends to deeper into the Park Forest, you need to buy tickets (Rs. 125.00 for Nepalese/Rs.1,050.00 for foreign nationals).

After completing the formalities, you continue uphill through the Park Forest. Please be advised that you need to slow down as you cruise past several sentry-posts on the way-and apparently no honking. After something like a couple of kilometers, you enter the Army Command and Staff College premises.

Moments later you will catch a glimpse of a beautiful white building reminding you of a British country manor house surrounded by matching lush-green lawns and lined with flowerbeds. A solitary cannon sits with stacked projectile shots on a raised platform by the roadside.

Only a fleeting glance is all you can get as civilians are not allowed to stop the vehicle and hang around the premises–strict army regulations. As expected, the place exudes an air of flawless orderliness, so typical of the military.
After 10 minutes, you cruise by the last sentry-post and crest the hilltop–that’s Danda Gaon (1,800m: Google map).  If the north is covered with thick forest, which forms the core Park zone and extends to the Shivapuri peak (2,732m), the south commands a spectacular view of the Kathmandu Valley.
Predominantly a Tamang village, Danda Gaon consists of small clusters of houses scattered on the terraced gradient intercepted by cultivated land that drops to the foothills.
Things to do in Danda Gaon
Picnicking: Picnicking at Danda Gaon can be fun, but to do that you will need to select the venue from among the number of resorts located there. The park area does not permit picnicking. All you got to do is book your place and place an order for food; the resort does the rest.
Hike or bike:
For hikers, Danda Gaon offers a number of choices– from day-longs to hour-longs or simply a walk around the village and watch the rural life go by or stop to chat with the local folks. A leisurely walk down the hillside will take you around the scattered Tamang settlements.
You can hike further down to Dulal Gaon and Fulbari. The elevation affords a bird’s eye view of the town of Jhor Mahankal, north-west of Kathmandu.

If you love a quiet walk through a lush forest, a two-hour walk north to Surya Chaur, Guruje Bhanjhyang (highway to Nuwakot) serves your interest. The Shivapuri forest boasts both a temperate and sub-tropical forests such as the pine, alder, wild Himalayan cherry, and rhododendron to name a few. In the hushed trail, the trees and thick shrub stand as silent sentinels as crickets and birds break the silence.
Mountain biking across this stretch of forest to Guruje is equally thrilling as the trail cuts through thick forests and some technical sections with one rock garden that requires challenging maneuvering.

If you are lucky and tread lightly without making any noise (animals in the wild are said to fear human voice the most), wildlife like barking deer, pine marten, kalij pheasant or the hefty Russian wild boars (introduced in the 1970’s as gifts to the then King Mahendra) might cross your path.
Leopards, including clouded leopard and Himalayan black bears, too, are natives of the Shivapuri forest; but rest assured, no need to feel jumpy as they are nocturnal and while you trudge along the jungle trail they would be bedded down in profound slumber in some impenetrable brush deep inside the far reaches of the forest.  Sightings of pheasants and barking deer are common, though–that is if you maintain silence.
With more than 300 species of birds,  the forest is home to rare bird species like the Hoary-throated Barwing (babbler family), White-throated Tit and no less than the jewel in the crown of Shivapuri forest–the elusive Spiny Babbler (kande Bhyakur in Nepali). An endemic species, they are found only in Nepal. Bird watchers, the Shivapuri forest sure promises a treasure trove of the rarest of bird species–you can bet your bottom rupee on that!
In the same fashion, a one- hour-walk north-east across the Park Forest, then another half-hour of a stiff climb on stone-steps coupled by narrow jungle trail through dense thickets brings you to Bishnudwar (1,950m), the perennial spring-fed source from where the sacred Vishnumati river drains. The trees standing around the river basin are festooned with colorful prayer flags.

A cave-like hollowed out cavity in a solid rock face holds a shrine. A short footbridge constructed with tree-branches and no guardrails spans the Bishnumati River (hardly 5m wide), which at the time we visited was just a trickle.

Another footbridge leads down the river to hollowed-out rocks which appear like caves as the water flows in between big rocks and boulders. Little surprise, the water from Bishnumati appeared gin-clear during our visit. I shook my head in disgust as I thought about the same river literally turned into open sewage as it enters the urban sprawl.

Day-long hikes include the Bagdwar(2,490m), the source of the Bagmati River, the Shivapuri peak, and Nagi Gompa, a nunnery located above the craggy cliff of Tarebhir and Chisopani among others.
Caveat: Hikers are advised to exercise caution and avoid straying from the specified tracks as you might get lost in the dense forest that covers a massive 134 sq. kilometers encompassing three districts–Kathmandu, Nuwakot, Sindupalchok, extending as far as the Dhading district. Following several reports of missing hikers in the past, the park rule has made it mandatory to hire a licensed jungle-guide for foreign nationals.
Night halt
If you wish to spend the night at Danda Gaon, there are a number of resorts to choose from. We tried the Green Valley Resort. Set up a decade ago, what I liked about the place was its expansive lawns and a terraced landscape with a wide view of Kathmandu valley. The food was good and the service impeccable.

Regarding accommodation, you are spoilt for choice from Tented Luxury huts, Villa Studios to Swiss Cottage and the Presidential Suite. The interior of the Presidential Suite done in two-tier with an exquisite Western pastoral architecture with paneled floors and stairs was exquisite.  I later learned that the small house used to be the residence of the Australian architect Tom Crees of the Kurintar-based Riverside Spring Resort-fame.  (He won a prestigious award for it).
“We offer special packages for couples and arrange for guides too for those who wish to hike around the Park Forest,” said Ganesh Shrestha, the resident manager at the resort.

The mystique of the Seti trail,"Monday, April 29, 2019","The ‘Lake City’ Pokhara never tires me although I have been to this beautiful city for the umpteen times . . . and the sight of Seti River gorge never ceases to haunt me every time I see it.
What is so amazing about Seti is its bizarre journey across the city of Pokhara. The mystery deepens when the wide boisterous river enters a dark gaping hole in the face of a hill at the K. I. Singh Bridge, vanishes, appears again into narrow gorges, suddenly disappears and after a brief journey into the subterranean, dramatically reappears to finally spill out into a raging full-blown river.
And the river cuts right through the city core, appearing like a dark abyss with no view of the bottom at most places. For years, I longed to explore the Seti river gorge from its mouth at the K.I. Singh Bridge and its mystical onward journey through the heart of Pokhara until its tail-end, but every time I visited the city, I missed out on it. In 2013, I finally did it.
The glacier-fed river Seti (Gandaki) that has dug deep subterranean tunnels into the city has long since mystified the people of Pokhara, too. Going by the local myth, the elders in Pokhara believe and fear that the entire city floats on the waters of the Seti.
The porous underground, the maze of caves, chasms, and lakes which abound the Pokhara valley all adds to the mystery. More than that, the Seti flowing more than 50 meters deep (the deepest is estimated at 80m) below the street level also serves as a geological enigma.
Purna Bahadur Jwarchan, an environmental engineer from New Road, Pokhara shed light on a mysterious incident that took place some 10 years ago. “An entire truck, parked in a street a night before at Archal Bot (near the Bindyabasini temple) sank into a cavernous pit and was literally buried,” he said.  “Cases of such subsidence have been recurrent in and around the city, some alarming. A few come to notice but most go unreported,” he further added.
The findings made by the Chinese contractors during the construction of the Nayapul, near Prithivi Chowk, were no less startling. The Seti had scoured out hollow spaces on its sides as deep as 250 meters at some places. “Statistics show that Pokhara has the highest precipitation (3,350 to 5,600mm/year) in the country. But even the heaviest rainfall doesn’t lend the Pokhara streets waterlogged for the water gets sucked below ground in no time,” Jwarchan added.
Geologists believe that Pokhara valley is nothing but a gravel-mass filling brought down by the catastrophic Seti flash floods, initially triggered off by an earthquake in the high Machhapuchare and Annapurna region. In its wake, the river is also said to have worked up extensive terraces, lakes (nine lakes listed in Ramsar Site, Kaski), caves and gorges in the valley.
And there is GLOF (Glacial Lake Outbursts Floods) to consider. A GLOF is said to have occurred 450 years ago with an area of 10 km2 located behind the Machhapuchare , an ice-cored moraine collapse that brought down 50-60m thick debris into the Pokhara basin( T. Yamada & C.K. Sharma).
Referring to the disastrous Seti floods of May 2012, Kunda Dixit in the Nepali Times wrote: “The Seti has seen much bigger floods in its history, one of them occurring about 800 years ago, which was of a biblical proportion and brought down a wall of debris 100m high to what is now Pokhara city.”
If you fancy exploring the trail of the Seti gorge, it is best done on foot or better still on a bicycle, as you can cover more ground in less time. I did it on a bicycle. Mountain bikes can be hired from quite a number of shops at the Lakeside (try Hallan Chowk).
The asking price then was 800 to 1000 rupees varying between shops. I got one for 700—it took a mulish haggling, though. If you plan to bicycle, ask for a helmet, an air-pump, and a lock, all included in the price.
If you happen to be in Pokhara in June/July, better carry a raincoat—just in case. There is no telling if you get caught up in one of those freaky shifts in Pokhara weather. I was. It was sunny, way too warm when I started but the afternoon suddenly took a mood swing—first I was hit by a dust storm and then a lashing downpour.

From Mahendra Pul, it took me 25 minutes to the K. I. Singh Bridge. With no traffic stress (times have changed today, though), almost zero exhaust fumes and dust I felt an incredible sense of relief. It was like riding in my own backyard! The dramatic journey of the Seti River begins at this gorge mouth through a dark narrow crevice on a rocky outcrop.
On my way to the K. I. Singh bridge, as I leisurely pedaled by Bhimsen Tole (street) to Bindyabasini (a Hindu shrine dedicated to Goddess Bhagwati located on top of a wooded knoll), much revered by the Pokhrelis (people of Pokhara), I noticed between rows of modern houses some very old ones too—reminding that the street must have been once a very old locality.
So it was; the history of Pokhara has it. Highly impressed by Kathmandu valley’s culturally rich and ornate architecture, the King of Kaski (then a Chaubise Rajya: a principality; now a district with Pokhara as headquarters), in 1752 AD, decided to invite ethnic Newar craftsmen and artisans from the Nepal Valley, cities of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur.
Most of those workers went back after doing their stint, but some took up permanent residence at Bhimsen Tole. Although languishing in obscurity and neglect amid burgeoning concrete structures, a handful of these old houses still retained the last vestiges of the borrowed Newari heritage and craftsmanship of the then Nepal valley. I have no idea if those houses still remain today . . . probably not.

At the K. I. Singh Bridge, as I took the flight of steps down to a tiny park with benches around, the deep rumble of the gushing water hit my ears. A roughly 15m long bridge spanned the gorge; an irrigation canal ran right through the middle of the bridge and entered a tunnel before disappearing into the wooded hillside.
You could peer down from the bridge on both sides for a giddying view. With an overhanging brush, the steep side walls slide down some 40m into a gully of rushing water, which looks like milk being churned to make butter. Incredulous, I could not help wondering how come the river so big and wide only a few hundred feet north could squeeze through that crack a little over a meter wide—and disappear into the hills.

Next, I tried the Prithivi Narayan Campus, hardly ten minutes away from the K. I. Singh Bridge. As you go around the back of the campus premises, a complete change of scenery appears before your eyes—beautiful, if not spectacular. The Seti disappearing into a rocky cleft at the K.I. Singh Bridge, exits here at the base of a hill into an almost 400m wide canyon; more than 50 feet high embankments tower over the river.

From the ridge, you can see way down a rivulet called Kali, which joins Seti at a foothill as the towering Kahun Danda(hill) soars into the eastern skies. On the other side of the ridge across a suspension bridge, you can make out a cluster of buildings: the Manipal Hospital.  After crossing the suspension bridge a paved road parallel to the hospital’s compound goes north and a stony dirt road that goes down to the Seti-Kali river confluence.

I decided to explore the confluence. If the Seti (in late June) water looked like milk coffee, the lesser Kali, which could be waded through, appeared light blue. The rivulet appeared busy: Men bathed, women washed clothes and kids frolicked in the cool clear water as the Seti surged out of a cavernous hole in the face of a hill with overhanging brushes. Curiously, it reminded me of the mystery cave entrance from my childhood favorite comic-book, Phantom: the Ghost Who Walks.
My next stop was at Fulbari.  Seti here again confronts a wooded cliff. A flight of steps takes you down to the river.  The opening in the hill resembles the one at the Seti-Kali confluence. A Narayan temple stands high up on the opposite embankment. The river disappears again into the hill with an intimidating roar.
Then, I headed towards the bustling Mahendra Pul(bridge), 20 minutes away on my bicycle. Here, most visitors to Pokhara get their first glimpse of the narrow Seti gorge. As you peer down to look at the Seti, you’ll shake your head apparently disapproving the piles of filth dumped in there.

Subsequently, the Seti course took me to Ram Ghat, the cremation grounds of Pokhrelis. Due west of Mahendrapul and past a Ram temple, I crossed a bridge over the narrow Seti gorge for the third time. At the bridge, the Seti exits the fissure and bursts out into an amazingly wide expanse with vast sandbanks while high embankments flank the river. The Seti can be a frightening spectacle during the monsoon at Ramghat.

The river does not follow a strict pattern, however, and can turn most unpredictable—and devastating—monsoon or otherwise. Heavy rains, landslides, or snow avalanches in the high Annapurna region trigger off floods even in normally calm months.
The havoc and loss of lives caused by the May 5, 2012, Seti flash floods that unexpectedly hit the Pokhara valley bear testimony to this fact. At Ramghat, the Seti (in late June) was flanked by large sandbanks that stretched out to the footholds of the high embankments
For the third time, the Seti enters the gaping mouth of a hill here. During monsoon, the water level rises and covers almost the entire sandbanks.
After Ramghat I caught the highway at Buddha Chowk, onwards to Prithivi Chowk, the busy intersection that reminded me of Kathmandu’s nasty gridlock. On the way, I stopped by the China Bridge or Naya Pul, as it’s called, and took a look down the narrow Seti gorge.

Now for the final leg, I pedaled south of the Bus Park at Prithivi Chowk on a gravel road into the outskirts. The road led down to a wooden bridge over the Seti, passable only for pedestrians and bicycles. With shrubs and dense undergrowth, the Seti water down the narrow gorge was hardly visible.
The river continued its journey through the chasm, to the southern ramparts of the Pokhara valley. As I proceeded on the paved road to Naya Gaun (literally, new village), I came to another bridge, a vehicular one this time. With newer settlements dotting the landscape, the pristine farther reaches of southern Pokhara valley too seemed encroached by human habitation.
After something like 20 minutes, I arrived at the IMM (International Mountain Museum), the place called Ratopahire or Gharipatan—a good vantage point that commanded a spectacular view in the north of the Machapuchare, the Annapurnas, Manasalu, Lamjung Himal and to the extreme left, the Dhaulagiri. The Seti, here, exited the chasm and wound its way down between boulders, getting steeper and rockier. I continued on the paved road till a bridge over Seti called Dhunge Sanghu (literally, a stone bridge). Here, the Seti for the last time entered the chasm with a deafening roar, the water churning white.

Dhunge Sanghu made a compelling view of the river and the surrounding countryside. Being on elevated land, I could make out the dark outline of the lushly wooded gorge from above as craggy walls with undergrowth flanked it. The eastern skyline, on the other hand, was dominated by the red building of the Fulbari Resort, perched high on a ridge.
Some 200m down, I could make out a small bridge across the gorge. That was Sita Paila, beyond that the Seti spread out into a wide canyon, totally free, as it wound its way south and was lost on the horizon. A shrine of Shiva was located at the high banks of the river accessible by stone stairs.

My adventure ended there. Guess what, I had nearly covered the entire length of Pokhara city, crossed the Seti gorge no less than six times—and explored nothing short of a mystery trail. I pedaled back—happier and wiser.

Patlekhet Community Homestay continues to thrive even after devastating earthquake,"Tuesday, April 23, 2019","When the likes of Kesav Prasad Badal and Rabindra Neupane proposed the idea of a community homestay to the people of Dandagaun in Patlekhet, Kavre in 2011, many did not take it seriously. Some even laughed at them.
But seven years on, the homestay they imagined has not only become reality but also survived many adversities including the 2015 earthquake.  It has now become a destination adored by Nepalis and foreign tourists.
Beginning
The homestay project started in late 2011. But Neupane, who is now the manager of Patalekhet Community Homestay, shares that the initial plan was a bit different. “We were all busy with our own lives. The village was dependent on agriculture and livestock. But as soon as the BP Highway was constructed, we saw people from all parts of the country pass by. We felt that if we could sell things to passengers, people could earn,” shares Neupane.
But while Badal was the chairman of Village Development Committee, he got associated with Lovely Green Nepal, an NGO that works to create an economically sustainable, environmentally sound and socially peaceful and harmonious communities.
The director of the NGO was late Gore Kaji Sangat, who introduced Badal and the people of Dadagaun to Everything Organic Nursery which provided technical assistance and training to both Nepali and foreigners.
“Sangat sir and Osino san from Lovely Green Japan then asked us if we would like to host their Japanese group,” adds Badal who is now the President of the community homestay.
As the people had no idea what to do, they were first reluctant. But after Sangat said he’d teach them how to cater to the guests the community agreed to do so.
“He stayed with us and taught us how to host and what the foreigners liked. We did a lot of activities with the foreign group and to our surprise they loved it. They enjoyed our hospitality which made us want to do this more,” adds Neupane.
Sangat then, with the help Osino, started to bring in more Japanese tourists to the homestay. Along with the Japanese, a Taiwanese group also started coming to learn organic agricultural techniques from Everything Organic Nursery. That group also stayed at the community homestay.
“By 2014 we started to get a good number of foreign visitors. It helped us sustain the homestay. But then disaster struck,” shares Neupane.
Problems due to earthquake
The 2015 earthquake damaged the homes in the area used for the homestay. All 16 buildings collapsed.
“There were hardly any homes remaining. We were on the brink of closing down. It wasn’t easy for us to rebuild but then help came,” adds Badal.
Help didn’t come in the form of financial aid, but it came in the form of commitment to send more tourists to the place. The Taiwanese group committed to send regular visitors which helped the homestay during the troubled times.
“They even came to visit us after the earthquake. They stayed in temporary shelters and tents and helped us remove the debris left by the earthquake. If we look back that help was invaluable. It helped us get back on our feet. If they hadn’t promised to send people, there is no doubt we would have closed down,” adds Badal.
Badal adds that the Japanese and Taiwanese groups also gave funds to build six community schools and a community centre in the village which is home to three different cooperatives.

Error in judgment
Neupane reveals that the villagers made one mistake while rebuilding their houses: they built concrete ones.
“We were afraid that the old houses would crumble down. None of us and that includes me felt that the old mud and stone houses would be good so I was the first to build a concrete house,” shares Neupane.
He adds that a Taiwanese visitor had told him not to build one because that would mean others would follow but he didn’t take his advice. By the time Neupane realised it was too late.
“The traditional look of the village and the homestay has disappeared. We want to bring some back but it’s not possible,” he adds.


Impact on village
Badal further adds that the homestay directly or indirectly has given employment to 100 people. He shares that the project has helped many others in the process.
“Before we were farmers who earned income by selling vegetables and milk. It is still that most of us do but the homestay has helped us a lot. We have learned new techniques of farming thanks to the Everything Organic Farm who provide us with technical knowledge and seeds. They motivate us to produce organic produce.”
He adds that foreign visitors also teach them a lot. This project hasn’t just brought them income but also taught them how to be civil and exposed them to something entirely different. Badal mentions they have learnt the importance of cleanliness and health and safety. Before their cow sheds used to be dirty but now things are cleaner. They also have learned new techniques to produce organic vegetables.

“When I was a kid, I used to waste my time doing stupid things. But now the village has transformed. The homestay has empowered most of us. It hasn’t stopped people from leaving the village but it has helped us set an example that we can do something staying in the village itself,” says Neupane who also adds that the project has also helped village learn about tourism and its impact.
Badal has similar views. He adds that during the early days, people didn’t want to keep more tourists in their homes. But as they gradually started doing it, people started to feel that it was easy. “People who used to tell us we don’t want many visitors now say that they want more. Others have come and asked us if they can join. This project has been quite good for the village as one house on an average earns Rs 15-20,000 if a tourist group stays for a week,” he adds.
To cater to the needs of the foreign tourists, the homestay owners have also been given hospitality training by Nepal Tourism Board, NATHAM and Taragaun Development Committee.
Nepali Tourists
The homestay hasn’t just attracted foreign tourists. It has also seen a lot of local tourists in the past few years. With only 42 km away from Kathmandu the place has seen NGOs, colleges and other organisations visit on a regular basis.
Neupane shares that the place gets around 1,000 local tourists a year, but is quick to add that not all understand the concept of a homestay.
“While many respect the way things are run in the village we do get a few who don’t. They don’t want to enjoy the peace and quiet the homestay offers. They’re here for a good time as they play music and party till late. Even though they spend more money than foreigners do, their attitude has made some of us reluctant to host Nepali groups,” he adds.
Future
The future of the project is simple – keep improving. Most of the homestays now are on concrete homes with a bedroom that accommodates two and a clean attached bathroom with a commode. The stakeholders who didn’t want many tourists, in the beginning, are now desperate for more.
The homestay committee is now planning to do more marketing to ensure they have more footfalls. Currently, the place gets around 1000 foreign and 1000 Nepali visitors and they want more.
They are also working on keeping the place clean however because the place is so close to the highway it isn’t as possible.
“I feel that starting this has been beneficial to the society in general. It has helped us a lot. I feel that more places should have community homestays. If it’s possible people should open because it changes the place. It makes it better,” adds Badal.

Nine Nepali hill stations to beat the heat this summer,"Thursday, April 11, 2019","Historians believe that Britishers developed various places of hilly region in India as an refuge for them in summer. The places were developed as tourist destinations later. Though not a colony of Britishers, Nepal also has many of such places, which offer the visitors a cool refuge in the scorching summer.
Here is a list of nine places, which you can visit to beat the summer heat this year. The list incorporates places from east to west; so that you can choose the ones based on your current location.

For those living in eastern Nepal, Kanyam would be the best place to beat the heat this summer. Famous for its beautiful tea garden, the place has cool breeze flowing throughout the year. You could spend time in Phikkal Bazaar watching the town do its thing or visit Mai Pokhari and watch the day go by. Known as the queen of hills, the place is definitely worth a visit.


One of the most popular places in eastern Nepal, Bhedetar gives its visitors the soaring views over Everest and Makalu. It is the best place to beat the Terai heat during the summer as the temperatures are cooler throughout the year. Bhedetar is not just a view point. The place has something to offer for thrill seekers as well. Nine kilometres down the trail, there is the Namaste Waterfall, which the locals also call Simsuwa. You can take a dip in the cold water or go canoeing in the river. There is also the option of paragliding from Bhedetar to Dharan, one of the biggest cities in the east.

Located at an altitude of 2175 metres, Nagarkot is the closest hill station for the people of Kathmandu. It is one of the most scenic spots in the region, renowned for its sunrise views of the Himalayas. On a good day, one can also get from this place a glimpse of Mount Everest and other mountain ranges like Annapurna, Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Jugal, Rolwaling and Numbur.
Nagarkot also has a wide range of hotels and lodges which mean one need not worry about where they want to stay. The place is a bit pricey, but where else can you enjoy Himalayan views from the comfort of your hotel balcony?
You can also take a public bus to Nagarkot from Kamal Binayak, east of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, easily.

Kakani is another place quite close to Kathmandu. Many call it a natural playground. Many foreigners prefer Kakani for the calmness the place offers. People say that it is the quieter version of Nagarkot.
Famous for its rainbow trouts, you can also try some juicy strawberries when you visit Kakani. From a series of high points along the ridge, there are magnificent views of the Himalayan skyline stretching all the way from Annapurna to Everest, via Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Gauri Shankar, Dorje Lhakpa and Shishapangma.
However, there aren’t as many luxury hotels as they are in Nagarkot.
Kakani is a major gateway for hiking and mountain biking routes in neighbouring Shivapuri National Park.

Perched 2322 m above sea level, with clear views to the north, east and west, the tiny village of Daman is another destination quite close to Kathmandu. It’s one of few places close to the valley that gets snowfall, which is why it would make for an ideal place to go to beat the summer heat.
The place boasts a spectacular outlook on the Himalaya in the whole of Nepal. There are unobstructed views of the entire range from Dhaulagiri to Mt Everest.

If you have more than a day to spare, heading out to Bandipur would be a good option. It is probably the only place in Nepal, apart from Kathmandu Valley, which has kept its Newari culture alive. With its attractive 18th century architecture, pedestrian zone and outdoor dining, it has a distinctly European feel. Many call it a living museum. You can also travel to neighbouring villages to get to know about Magars as well. The view from the top of the hill is just staggering as you get to see a vast mountain range. The sunset from Bandipur is particularly good too.

Ghandruk is arguably the best hill station in Nepal. It claims to be the most visited trekking area in Nepal, and is widely known and popular among international visitors. It is accessible in one day, with a four to five hour walk after a short ride from Pokhara. Ghandruk offers the majestic view of Annapurna mountain and a splendid sunrise and sunset. The Ghandruk trek is most popular for wonderful Gurung culture, the beautiful village, geographical differences and the fantastic views of the mountains of Annapurna (7219 m), Machhapuchhare (6993 m) and Himchuli (6411 m).

While Ghandruk gives you majestic views of the mountains, Jomsom takes you really close to a few mountains, especially Dhawalagiri and Nilgiri. Geographically, the place is the rain shadow area and offers visitors something quite different. While there you can also go to Muktinath Temple, which is only an hour’s drive from there. Or you can also go two Marpha or Kagabeni, which is equally picturesque.

Located at an altitude of 3,100 metres, Jaljala is one of the best places in western Nepal. The place, which many believe is where the Maoists started their armed conflict from, has come a long way in the past decade. It is now a popular religious, touristy and cultural destination for many.
The place is an hours walk from Liwang of Rolpa district and is a must visit place if you live around western Nepal. Jaljala is a grassland that is wet almost round the year. There is a natural reservoir from where water flows in almost every direction all the year round. From April to September, wild flowers decorate the entire area. The place also offers beautiful views of Sisne Himal, Dhaulagiri and Otha Himal among others. Also, the Bhama Cave, which is yet to be explored to the fullest, is the other attraction of Jaljala.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nine-nepali-hill-stations-to-beat-the-heat-this-summer.html,travel
Dating death for a living: The bamboo-rafters of Sun Koshi,"Monday, March 25, 2019","What really amazed me was to see those intrepid rafters’ “natural ability to turn hardship into promise, to find humour in deprivation.”
“What on earth are these guys doing on this boulder-ridden fast river . . . surfing?” I asked myself incredulously, as I watched the distant two figures floating down the river—on their feet! I hastily retrieved my fishing line—and waited with bated breath, my camera at the ready. As it turned out, they were on some kind of a flimsy raft. And then, I froze—because one of the guys fell overboard in the rapids.

“There he is”, I almost cried out as I saw him—rather his upper body, hanging onto to one end of the bouncing raft as the choppy waters slapped him. He tried to climb … fell … tried again … slipped, and fell again. Then, I lost him between the leaping waves. Damn! I started almost praying as I furiously clicked away on my camera.
But I jumped, next! I saw him again. With half his body below water, he was still struggling.
“Come on, come on, you can do it, buddy!” I mumbled to myself.  And then—a miracle, he clambered aboard! I waved madly at them as they came bobbing up and down and shot past me almost at arm’s length.
I was a witness to the above fateful drama way back in March 2008 at the confluence of the Sun Koshi and Tamur rivers at Trivenighat, Chhintang village, Dhankuta district.  I was on a fishing trip to a village called Mai Beni, in the lower hills of Bhojpur, east Nepal, some 550 km from Kathmandu. I learned later that those guys were local villagers ferrying bamboos down the big river to sell.
The rafters lash together the bamboos in bunches of 25 to 30 stalks by a jungle vine locally called birali and stripped bamboo-skins called choya and shape it into a cone to serve as a raft, an ingenious skill handed down to them for generations. On arrival at the destination, the trussed up bamboos are taken apart and sold.
The rafters choose the river because the distance is twice less over the foot trail. Anyway, lugging the bamboos across narrow treacherous trails (almost over 30kms) is anything but possible. The river journey is by no means a smooth sail, however.
Nepal’s Sun Koshi(literally,  the river of gold)—a glacier-fed river rises in the Himalayas near the Tibetan border(China) and turns steeper, faster and rockier—with boulders the size of trucks—and massive rapids as it winds down the mid-hills.
Removed from civilisation
Mai Beni (literally river confluence of the God) stands on a slope of a sparsely wooded hill that juts out to the confluence of two rivers, the Arun and the Sun Koshi (locals also call it Dudh Kosi). With only a handful of houses for habitation and insignificant cultivation, the hillside at the time appeared far-removed from civilization—seemingly back of beyond. There was no motor road to Mai Beni, only a 4-hour foot trail hewn into the side of hills—only a couple of feet wide at some places—with more than 500m drops.
And the bumpy ride to the start of the trail, Baraha Chhetra (20km from Dharan),  in a battered locally-run Landrover overflowing with people—in and above  on the roof—along the narrow dirt road that fell away on its side to several hundred feet into the Sapta Koshi (literally, seven rivers), was like leaving everything to fate.
In Mai Beni I was a guest at Beni Kanchha’s (Kanchha, for short), a thatched stone-and-mortar house that looked out to the Sun Koshi, some 100 meters away. In his late thirties, Kanchha, an ethnic Rai, looked the perfect native hill people of Nepal, strong and sinewy.
A father of two, a girl aged 13, and a boy still a toddler, Kanchha farmed a few crops in his little land, raised goats and chicken, fished and, besides, ferried bamboos down the Sun Koshi. His wife, Kanchhi, juggled the household chores, the children and, in between, helped Kanchha.
A great fishing guide and enjoyable company, Kanchha surprised me as a gifted story-teller too. And one night as I rested in his house in the dim light of a wick lamp—mercifully relieved of the hot and humid day’s fishing—Kanchha sat cross-legged and narrated anecdotes about his 23 years at the river, fishing and ferrying bamboos. And one story, in particular, made me relive the drama I witnessed a few days ago. The deep resonant rumble of the nearby Sun Koshi kept us company.
That October day in Mai Beni for Dan Bahadur Rai—Beni Kanchha, to fellow villagers—began as any other.
Beni Kanchha and his mate Nabin Rai were preparing for a long trip to Terardi Ghat(riverside bamboo yard) near Chatara bazaar to sell bamboos. They were set on ferrying 225 ghans (stalks; technically ‘culms’) as against the usual 150 to 180 ferried at a time by most rafters. Another friend, Man Bahadur Majhi joined them as a helping hand as the load was larger than the usual.
After two hours of hard work of tying up the bamboos, the raft was finally water worthy. Kanchha made double sure that the knots were tied down firmly and the charis, the 35 foot bamboo poles used for steering the raft, in good shape.
After a hurried dal/bhat, the trio set sail. The journey back would take them more than six hours on foot. None relished the idea of stumbling on the trail after dark on their way back home.
The sky was a brilliant blue and the sun bright with no noticeable wind. The post-monsoon water level was high but calm.  A perfect day, thought Kanchha as he looked up at the cloudless sky and then at the turquoise Sun Koshi.
“Ah-ong”, “ah-ong”, the honk sounded, as a pair of Brahmini ducks (ruddy shelduck) took flight from the opposite bank, circled and flew low overhead, proudly displaying their dashing plumage of fawn-orange, cream, grey, green and black against the blue sky. Kanchha always loved to watch them fly.
Facing the rapids
Within 10 minutes, the trio arrived at the first rapid. Kanchha gave a cautioning shout and rammed his chari into the churning water—his mates followed suit. Huge sprays slapped the three as the raft climbed the waves and then dived into the white water. But just moments later, it shot out—safe. Phew! Nabin whistled in relief. The first hurdle was over—three more to go.
The trio relaxed as the raft steadied on placid waters. Time for some tobacco, decided Nabin and reached for the plastic pouch in his pocket, and started rubbing some into his palm.  Kanchha lighted a cigarette instead and regarded the approaching confluence, where the powder-blue Arun tumbled into the larger Sun Koshi.
He waved at the local boys on the right bank, who were hurling their hand-cast lures for mahseer(a prized game-fish) into the water. The fishers shouted back their greetings.
The Sun Koshi-Arun confluence posed no threat for the rafters. Kanchha’s main concern was the next confluence, some 200 meters down, where the rock-strewn fast running Tamur rushed to meet the swollen Sun Koshi (after Arun drains into her). The bigger and wider river after this point is called the Sapta Koshi( a merger of seven rivers) and flows south over vast plains into  Bihar, India, to finally drain into the Ganges.
For the trio, the dreaded moment had arrived. As they drifted close towards the confluence, they peered apprehensively ahead at the tiny speck rapidly looming up–the jyanmare dhunga, literally, “the killer boulder.”
Christened thus by the bamboo rafters, the massive boulder surrounded by smaller ones juts out almost 4 ft above the crashing waters, next to where the Tamur pours into the Sun Koshi.
It also happens to be one of the most treacherous rapids held in awe and fear by the rafters—and long the site of innumerable accidents, resulting in serious injuries and even deaths.
Now, the threesome needed to hold the heavy and sluggish raft at arm’s length from the killer boulder, meet headlong the force of the Tamur and then swerve quickly to their right to dodge the smaller boulders hidden beneath the thrashing waters.
“Here, a rafter’s sheer grit, experience and the best of his prowess are put to the test”, Beni Kanchha explained
They were ready. Kanchha yelled out the instructions as the raft rode the white waves and then nosedived.
Kanchha suddenly realized that the current was way too strong for the unwieldy raft (larger than the normal size), which forced them dangerously close to the killer boulder. All three plunged in unison their charis and gathered their full strength to push the raft away. Try as they might, the raft seemed to veer off course.
Cheating death
Fear gripped Kanchha—but before he could shout another warning the speeding raft dashed full force into the dreaded boulder, hovered for a few seconds, and then was hurled like a matchbox towards the waiting rocks on their right.
Despite the deafening roar, Kanchha clearly heard the cracking thud at the first direct hit followed by a second.  Both the birali creepers and choya strips snapped, and horrified, he watched the raft split clean in two. Even before he knew, the waves washed him overboard—his mates, too.
“I kicked furiously and luckily managed hold on the broken raft. Fearing for my friends’ safety, I held on,” Kanchha recalled. “Suddenly the raging water tipped the split raft over carrying me underneath. Everything blackened. A deafening rumble like a hundred strong truck engines filled my ears. Trapped underwater for what seemed like ages, I fought hard, my lungs to bursting”.
Kanchha stopped to regain his breath, as if the recollection made him difficult to breathe.
“Then, I panicked. The first face that zoomed before my eyes was that of the man I owed the balance money for the bamboos. Then—all in a flash—it was my little son, daughter and Kanchhi, my wife. This is the end, I thought.”
“I don’t know what it was, must be God’s will—I suddenly surfaced. I somehow clambered on to the broken raft and saw, to my great relief, my mates drifting on the other half some 150 meters downstream.”
Help soon came from other fellow rafters who helped them to the nearest bank. After a brief respite, they fetched some birali vines, re-tied the split raft together and continued onwards to Terardi Ghat, still a long way.
They had to navigate two more treacherous rapids that lay ahead but, fearsome or not, they also had to be run. All went well, however, and the rest of the journey proved uneventful. When they finally reached Terardi they were three hours behind—and pitch-dark when back home.
This is how the bamboo rafters flirt with death on every trip down the Sun Koshi. Mishaps are common and the unpredictable river lays claim to one or two rafters almost every other year. Kanchha, then 37, started when he was 14, and he has had a close brush with death several times. Some others were not lucky enough to tell their tales.
During my visit, the bamboo trading down the Koshi was done mostly by hard-working men of ethnic Rai, Majhi and Tamang community.  All they saved was 10 rupees per stalk.
Living below poverty level, the lives of riverside natives in east Nepal was agonizingly hard. In the later years, far fewer numbers were in this trade in the wake of massive exodus of Nepalese youth to the Middle East and Southeast Asia seeking employment.
I travelled to Mai Beni for three more years (took a life-jacket as a gift to Beni Kanchha the second year) and witnessed those dare-devil rafters, bound by tradition and poverty, braving the rapids ferrying bamboos down the Koshi—unaided by any kind of life-saving gear. For the villagers, it was as much a means of livelihood as pig farming, raising goats and chickens, fishing and cultivating a few crops on the harsh countryside.
What really amazed me was to see those intrepid rafters’ “natural ability to turn hardship into promise, to find humour in deprivation.”

SWO-YATRA: This solo woman travel challenge takes Nepali ladies to a new journey,"Friday, March 22, 2019","
Perhaps the 2015 acid attack on two teenage girls in Basantapur of Kathmandu was enough to make Jason Shah realise challenges that women would face in the Nepali society while travelling.
Therefore when he was invited to join a march against the incident, he decided that it would make little or no difference in the situation. Instead, he vowed to do something more.
When Shah started NepaliTravellers with a few friends in 2015, he wanted to create a platform for Nepali travellers who could share their stories and problems while travelling in Nepal. Three years on, NepaliTravellers has become a public institution where people from different backgrounds have come and run campaigns. One of such campaigns is the solo woman travel challenge (SWO-YATRA).
“I wanted to do something different and creative. And as we were into tourism, we decided to send two women to travel to any destination of their choice on their own.”
After sending the two women, NepaliTravellers started to get good feedback and it gave them the motivation to continue the project.
“It was completely passion-driven, but soon we realised it could go a long way. We felt that, through this social initiative, we could talk about issues surrounding travelling in Nepal and the problems people, especially women travellers, face,” adds Shah.
While SWO-YATRA did intend to promote women travellers in Nepal, Shah mentions that this is not a women empowerment project. “We work with empowered women to promote travel in Nepal. We want to give out a message that people, mainly women, should travel. If the ladies did get empowered, I think it is purely coincidental.”
His thoughts are echoed by this year’s participant in SWO-YATRA, Pooja Rijal.
Rijal walked all the way from her house in Pepsicola of Kathmandu to the Everest Base Camp because she thought it was cool. Rijal also adds that this journey in no way has changed her as a person.
“I did it just because I wanted to travel and this was an amazing opportunity. This gave me a chance to get out of my comfort zone and experience something new. This trip offered me a new way to look at certain things,” adds Rijal who in 2018 was one of the 400 women who applied for the challenge.
The application process to take part in the solo woman travel challenge is a rigorous one. “We want to make it so because we want serious applicants. We do not want people to waste our time,” Shah says.
The girls who are sent to the journey are given a five-day active boot camp which teaches them risk management, first aid techniques and visual storytelling. It gives them a general idea of what to expect during their solo journey.
Shah also adds that the girls are also given self-defence training and map reading session, which will help them beyond their solo trip.
“We don’t want anything to go wrong. People haven’t said anything because nothing bad has happened till date, but if god forbids anything bad does happen, people will want our heads. We take the risk of these girls very seriously and that is why there haven’t been any incidents yet,” adds Shah.
Shah shares that one of the toughest moments is when parents come to talk to them and ask them if NepaliTravellers will take responsibilities.  “It’s not easy convincing them. While most understand, there are a few who don’t; which is why a few ladies pulled out of the trip,” adds Shah.
He says that the safety of these girls are of prime importance, which is why we have asked them to call us every night to inform where they are staying and a provide a number of the place they are staying at.
Rijal adds she didn’t face any trouble and shares she received a lot of support from her parents. “Yes they were worried, but they knew the hard work I had put to be selected to go on this trip. But I know many who were unable to go on this trip because their families were scared.”
Shah shares that his plan with SWO-YATRA is to solve issues like these. “Boys can travel easily, but girls can’t. They face so many restrictions which makes it quite tough for them. This is why from this year, we have come up with the title of Miss NepaliTraveller, who will be the face of this project.”
“We want one person to represent us. This year Pooja was selected as Miss NepaliTraveller and she will help us tell the stories of all these different women who have travelled to different parts of the country,” Shah continues.

NepaliTravellers is also coming up with a video series which will show people how these brave women travelled alone around Nepal. Through this series, they want to inspire more people, both men and women, to travel. “It doesn’t have to be alone and doesn’t have to be trekking. But Nepalis should travel so that people do not give us differential treatments,” adds Shah.
Rijal shares that being part of this challenge she met a lot of people and has realised that it has had an impact on a lot of people. “A 49-year-old woman solo-travelled as did an 18-year-old; and both of them have a different perspective. Some say they were empowered while some say that this was a life-changing experience,” adds Rijal who shares as Miss Nepali Traveller, she wants to be the face of a common traveller and not a celebrity.

Farewell to the enchanted kingdom,"Friday, March 15, 2019","Our last day in Lo Manthang was set aside for a tour of the Walled City and a visit to the Chhoser village to see the Jhong cave and the Nyphu monastery. We decided to take a walk around the city, letting our bikes take a break.
The weather in the morning was cold but sunny and windless; but afternoons would be windy, so said the charming lady owner of the Mystique Hotel, Karchyung Lhamo. Her husband, Wangchhen Lowa (better known to all as Ram Gurung) had left for work at the ACAP (Annapurna Conservation Area Project) office. With 20 years at ACAP, Ram seemed to know anything and everything about Mustang and proved a great help to me.
As we took a stroll along the street, I realised that we were outside the old Walled City as cafes, souvenir shops, more hotels lined the street.  It looked times had changed. With the coming of roads from Kathmandu and Korola, the Chinese border 30km away, the once little-known ancient city that thrived as the ancient Salt Route from Tibet to India, seemed to be bounding towards the glamorous lure of modernity.

Old houses seemed replaced with modern buildings and more concrete structures for new construction stood around.  Every hotel seemed to have conveniences like television and the Internet and the shops appeared well-stocked with an astonishing range of merchandise from cigarettes, rice to electronic goods–mostly Chinese.
The old part of the city within the perimeter of the wall, however, had a different story to tell. As we walked past mane-wheels and an impressive row of chortens, the street turned into a maze of narrow alleys, which led through a labyrinth of closely built white-washed mud houses still bearing antiquated windows, doors and crude stones for staircases built on the exterior. As goat skulls and Yak horns adorned the doorways, the roofs carried piles of wood stacked in a neat row.

I wondered that such places, unsullied by the trappings of development and modernity, still existed in the 3rd millennium.  They spoke of a past era and stood as a silent witness to their timeless existence.
Our tour brought us to the historical wall said to be the only of its kind in Nepal. It still looked sturdy and tall, surviving the historic earthquake of 2015. They had truly stood the test of time. Built in 1440 by the first King of Lo Manthang, Ame Pal, to defend the city against enemies and trespassers, the 2,472 ft long, and 26 ft. high wall is further fortified by 14 watch towers (dzongs), 40 ft. high at strategic corners.
“Lo Manthang, in fact, is wrongly spelt by people,” said Ram Gurung. “It’s Lo (southern), Men (medicine) and thang (plains). So, it translates to “southern plains of medicine,” he explained. “Maybe, that has to do with the Tibetan healing practice of amchi–a Tibetan practice of healing, which has been a common practice in Lo for centuries. We have a clinic and school in Lo Manthang (Lo Kunphen Clinic and School), too.”
We met with a big disappointment when we went to see the 14th century Tashi Gephel Palace located right in the middle of the town. A notice at the big gate read “closed for repair and restoration”. We, however, took a walk around the 4-storeyed white-washed building and wondered at the 600-year old architecture, now succumbing to the ravages of time. To my “tashi delek,” an elderly guy who happened to be sitting by, said, “The palace sustained severe damages during the 2015 earthquake”.

Next, we visited the historical gompas, which epitomize the rich heritage, religion, history and culture of the Lo, untouched and ageless.  Almost turned into ruins, the gompas, Thubchen, Jhampa and Choede with their priceless centuries-old murals, artefacts, frescoes, images of Buddha, other deities and ancient Tibetan scriptures underwent massive repair and restoration under the patronage of the American Himalayan Foundation and the dedication of a local group, the Lo Gyalpo Jigme Foundation.

Local artisans were trained and skilled carpenters were engaged for the restoration work with painstaking attention to detail. The name Luigi Feni from Rome, Italy, an aeronautical engineer turned art restorer has almost become a household name in Lo Manthang for his dedicated work (nearly 20 years) in restoring to their formal glory the mural paintings housed in those historic gompas of Lo Manthang.
Considered the oldest among the three gompas,  Jhampa monastery (also called Jhampa Lakhang) built in 1387 and belonging to the Sa-skya-pa Buddhist sect is said to be a true replica of a gompa in Tibet. What are astounding are the walls within the complex in the first and the second floors, which are literally covered with tantric mandalas (said to be 1,500 in numbers) done in golden colour, some embellished with turquoise, coral, silver and gemstones.

And among those works of art, a massive statue of Maitreya (Jampa Chenpo) or the future Buddha sits glowing with great solemnity rising from the ground to the first floor. The interior of the gompa with colours that dazzle the eyes and the mind speak of a resplendent work of art to a degree of excellence without comparison.

Next, the Choede Gompa founded in 1757, is highly revered by the Lowas, which also houses residence for monks and high lamas. The lamasery also includes a monastic school for young postulants seeking lamahood. The main attractions of the gompa include the images of centuries-old Mahakala and Vajra Kilaya.

Thubten Gompa, the second oldest after Jampa built in the early 15th century bears an impressive dukhang (assembly hall) with a high ceiling with the rafters engraved with the sacred Buddhist mantra, “the jewel is in the lotus” or more commonly understood as om mani pad me hum; the walls are finished in dazzling frescoes of various deities.
The visit to those gompas left us completely stumped. Honestly, I’d never seen such sublime work of art and had ‘quiet audience’ with life-size images of deities in so short a time. We were a little disappointed as photography inside the gompas was prohibited. Profoundly overwhelmed and humbled, we retraced our steps back to the hotel, the strong heady aroma of the incense from the gompas clinging to my nostrils.

As we made our way back to the hotel, watching life go by in the streets, everything seemed so laid back, as if everyone had all the time in the world. Women basked in the sun, chatting; elderly women spun yak wool; men squatted on ledges at shop fronts twirling mane-wheels; saffron-robed monks passed by leisurely thumbing prayer beads; children dashed around playfully; men and women alike herded past sheep and goats; cows roamed the streets freely, and the local women collected goat droppings and cow dung as fuel for their iron-stoves.

As we took the main street to our hotel, I spotted a young fellow playing some kind of an instrument . . . looked like a guitar to me. A small group watched him play. We stopped to look. That was a six-stringed Tibetan tungna dranyen (sgra-snyan) lute, which is as much an ornamental instrument as it is a musical accompaniment at local festivals.
After a quick lunch at the hotel, we set off for Chosser (3,916m), eight kilometres away to see the Shija Jhong caves.

It took us a little over an hour on our bikes to arrive at Chhoser village, clusters of adobe houses scattered around. The wind had started to escalate into a full-blown gale. We chose to walk to the Jhong cave.
Since the very first day of our journey to Lo Manthang, the landscape never ceased to amaze us. It seemed it would never stop. The rock formations in weird sizes and shapes loomed all around giving us the impression of having landed on yet another other-worldly place on earth.
Also read: Dreams are meant to be lived: to the enchanting Kingdom of Lo Manthang on two wheels

Treeless and bare, the landscape looked desolate, parched, arid and cold–the wind brutal and unrelenting as ever. For all that, the charm the rugged landscape held was hard to explain.

After what seemed like 45 minutes on that total wilderness, we arrived at the Jhong cave that towered above us as if trying to reach the infinite blue sky. It appeared like a flawless masterpiece done in an abstract by the greatest sculptor on earth, the Mother Nature, no less. If it would offer the geologists a fascinating subject for research, it would surely present endless mysteries for the archaeologists to unravel.

Overawed, we set foot on the 2,500 years old Shija Jhong Cave, just one among over 10,000 man-made caves that pepper the craggy cliffs of Mustang, most, near- impossible to access.

For ease of access, a flight of steps led to the entrance of the cave. After that, it was all primitive, by way of wooden ladders. The landings opened into passages and chambers. The ladders went up to a soaring fifth storey. I’d to pluck up enough courage to attempt the topmost floor as the ladder seemed to shake and wobble.

With more than 40 chambers, some had to be accessed through narrow tunnel-like entrances. And mind you, there were gaping pits too. One false step and you would take a fall to the lower storey. Some of the chambers had crude tanks and bins built into the walls for storage of water and grain; others appeared like sleeping quarters. Some had ceilings blackened by soot; must have served as kitchens.

Apparently, the Jhong cave is a living testimony to people having dwelled in caves for centuries in Mustang. Nearly every chamber had a gaping hole like a porthole of an aircraft which must have served as a window.  With no head for heights, it gave me the creeps even to take a peep from the gap from the fifth floor. We could even see the village of Chhoser in the distance.
The presence of thousands of man-made sky caves dug into the sheer cliffs of Mustang substantiates that cave civilization was inseparable from its past history. “People still live in some caves around Garphu and Chosser,” said a local guy from Chosser.
Apart from being used as living quarters, archaeologists speculate that those cave shelters were used for various purposes from burial ground for the dead to meditation chambers for the monks, a refuge from enemy attack to storage and battle lookouts. Some caves like the Luri and Tashi Kabum house mural paintings and even stupas built inside.
But questions like who built those caves, how and why still baffle the archaeologists today without plausible explanations. As it is, those dark caves of Mustang remain to this day shrouded in deep mystery and intrigue.

On our way back, we stopped to look at the Nymphu gompa, which made us wonder at its structure. Built into a solid rocky cliff, the gompa housed a prayer room with ornate tables and wall hangings. As oil lamps burned in one corner, a lama with eyes closed squatted on the floor before the image of Buddha. I wanted to pick up some info on the gompa but there was no one other than the monk in deep meditation. On the side of the cliff, there was a small opening into a dark cave. Again there was no one to guide us, so we headed back to Chosser.
The shadows lengthened and the sky in the horizon lit up in a tangerine hue as we ppedalledback to Lo Manthang, the cold weather and the high wind keeping us company all the way. It was already dark when we ducked into the warmth of the hotel’s dining area. I brightened up to see Ram Gurung sipping his shyu Cha (Tibetan tea) before the iron stove and joined him for a chat. My companions mingled with an Australian group of cyclists who had arrived that afternoon.

The chat really helped me glean some vital piece of information about the Walled City, closely tied to Tibet in culture, language and geography. Also called the ‘little Tibet,’ the lost Kingdom is said to be home to the last vestiges of traditional Tibetan culture and religion, virtually unchanged since the 14th century.
With a population of only 1200 and around 900 houses, Lo in the winter (starting December through March) is literally deserted with as low as 100 inhabitants who stand to weather the harsh months with the mercury plummeting down to 20 below and the city laden with heavy snow. Save for a handful of hotels to cater for late coming tourists and stragglers, nearly all are closed.

“The mass exodus to the warmer climes has been a tradition in Upper Mustang stretching back to millennia.  Some go to Kathmandu or Pokhara, others to Butwal and some to India,” said Ram.
In recent years, there has been widespread speculation and growing concern over the change that has nudged itself into the once little-known walled city. People argue that the rising influx of tourists, both foreign and domestic, and the advent of roads, one from Korola, the Chinese border and the other from Kathmandu are sure to bring in its wake inevitable change.
Ram Gurung aka Wanchhen Lowa admitted that the roads had already brought change to the city but they made life easier for the people of Lo, who for centuries have been living a harsh life. He seemed, however, very optimistic about Lo’s future and shared with me that time has also brought lately a growing awareness among the young generation that they have to save their identity, heritage, and age-old traditions nurtured by their ancestors for centuries to this day.
“Lo Manthang,” Ram explained “celebrates, among others, two main festivals every year: the Tiji and the Yartung. Tiji (the triumph of good over evil or chasing of demons) is the most prestigious among all is staged for three days.”
“The Yartung (translating to summer’s end),” he continued “coincides with the harvest time and again celebrated for three days. Now, Yartung almost came to be forgotten and stopped being staged for some time in Lo Manthang. It was the youths who came to the rescue and revived the ancient custom with renewed vigor and pomp.”
With that positive vibe, I joined my friends for dinner, our last in Lo Manthang–the enchanting tiny enclave hidden within the folds of majestic mountains on the Tibetan Plateau.

Despite all the speculation and gossip, the magic of Upper Mustang will never cease. The spectacular wind-eroded cliffs, the barren ridges, the moraine valleys, the isolated mesas, the strange fluted crags, the hogbacks, the lofty escarpments, the mesmerizing hoodoos, the mysterious caves and the massive Kali Gandaki gorge under the shadows of great mountains like the Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and many others will still be there to enchant us and will continue to remain there for our posterity to enjoy.
Hopefully, the brave and forbearing Lowas will continue to persevere as the custodian of their centuries-old faith, culture, religion, priceless monuments and last not the least their spiritual identity.
End of the six-part series.

"Exploring history, culture and religion in the fabled kingdom","Friday, March 8, 2019","At Tsarang, in the warmth of Maya’s Inn’s dining room, I never felt jauntier after those four grueling days on those wind-blasted dirt roads breathing in a ‘ton’ of dust and grit and almost succumbing to a disastrous experience at the Dajongla Pass on the second day. They were of a little matter now when I thought about Lo Manthang, just a trifling 16km away. I even broke into an animated chat with the guests and the hostess over a glass of my favorite Uwa (barley) liquor. My companions seemed no less excited at the prospect.
Maya Palbar Bista, who owned the inn, happened to be the late King of Lo Manthang, Jigme Dorje Palbar Bista’s Queen, Sidol Palbar Bista’s sister’s daughter. In her late thirtyish, she did not try to strike an attitude or show off that she came of a royal lineage. Not in the least.

Modest but down to earth, she seemed to have her hands full that entire evening preparing food and serving it juggling her work with her guests by satisfying their curiosity . . . with a smile.  “We have been in business since more than a decade in this old house but we will be moving to our new building under way, hopefully, by next year,” she said.  After supper, a big bowl of egg-veggie-noodle soup, and a refill of uwa liquor, we retired to our rooms and rode straight into our beds.

Day V
The first light of day at Tsarang heralded renewed enthusiasm and eager anticipation of seeing the Lost Kingdom. We hastily polished off a filling breakfast, dusted, oiled up our bikes and hopped on to our saddles to take a brief ride through the beautiful town.  The weather was cold but sunny with no sign of wind.

As we wound our way through the maze of narrow cobbled lanes, I noticed that the entire town seemed fortified with white painted rammed earth walls separating the adobe houses.  The fuel- wood (mostly twigs) neatly stacked on the roofs gave the impression of manicured hedgerow. Mane-wheels and chhortens seem to abound the streets and courtyards as we rode past. Sheep skulls with horns and Yak horns adorned the gate ways, doorways and the wall tops.
Built in the 13th century by the first King of Lo, Chhyogel Ame Pal Sangpo, it is said Tsarang or Charang got its name from the Tibetan word ‘Chaptrun Tsetran’ translating to a rooster’s wattle suggesting to the town built on a ridge over the Charang Chu canyon.

At one street corner we saw some large vessels sitting on wood-fired stoves. We asked the woman tending to the pots and learned that the vessels were used for distilling uwa liquor.

Shortly, we arrived at the imposing three-storey red Gompa, the Thupten Shedrub Dhargyeling Monastery saddling a narrow ridge defined against the blue sky. The ridge fell sharply to the Charangchu River forming a massive canyon. In winter, it is said glaciers can be sighted high above the canyon. The fierce-looking Tibetan mastiff we saw the other day was missing from the scene.

Belonging to the Sa Skya (translating to pale earth) school of Tibetan Buddhism and built in 1427 under the patronage of King Samdrup  Dorje the monastery bore a deserted look.  With the cracked paint peeling off the walls, the building looked desperately in need of repair and restoration.
Luckily, we found a young monk hanging around with some kids at the back. A life-size gong stood besides the wall of the monastery. The young fellow led us into the gompa. Photography inside the gompa was prohibited.

We made around surprisingly large rooms with 15th century frescoes and priceless thangkas adorning the walls. One of the dim lit rooms had a large statue of Buddha and exotic Tibetan Buddhist artifacts, texts and murals.  The monastery also housed an assembly room, but many rooms were left in disarray with cracked walls, and many needed rebuilding. Once, the monastery was said to have run a nunnery and housed hundreds of monks but less than fifty remain today. Sad and disappointed at seeing the gompa in a real bad shape, we left.

Next, the impressively large (5-storey) dzong(fort) palace perched on a sandstone cliff  and ringed by a thick copse of poplar and wild willow right across the monastery, appeared yet more derelict, almost falling apart.  Close to the building stood tall crumbling walls in ruins. We tried to find the resident lama of the dzong but not a soul seemed to be around.
As we were under a time constraint, we left but ran across a middle-aged monk dressed in a saffron-colored robe thumbing his prayer beads and heading towards the town. He was not the one who looked after the palace but was very helpful and helped us with bits of information on the fort.

“Samdrup Gephel Palace,” he began “was built in 1378 (before the monastery) by King Ame Pal, and once resided by the kings of Lo for centuries, and a pride of Tasarang.  It still houses a prayer room with gold-lettered sacred book, large Buddha paintings, frescoes of prestigious Tibetan Gurus, and many ornate thangkas. ”
“Besides,” he continued, “the palace holds a mummified snow leopard, ancient weapons, chain mail armors, and a dried up 500-year old severed hand.” The story about the hand there differed from that of Gheling. The hand belonged to the master architect who built the palace. It was done so that he could not build another palace of that splendor.
He further added, “Sadly, the palace fell into disuse (over 50 years now) and neglect and has fallen into disrepair. It is even dangerous to try to go to the upper storey lest the ceilings or the walls might cave in.”
As we hit the dirt road heading north, I tried to imagine the palace in its heydays and piece together in my mind the loose ends, but eventually gave it up. As we rode past a large chorten (Sungda chorten), the wind seemed to turn ferocious bringing in its wake dust and sand.

The landscape looked desolate, treeless and the weather cold, and dry. As the road climbed I could see the utility poles flanking the dusty road in perfect symmetry but ludicrously out of place. Shayeet and Diwas led while I and Khasing fell behind by almost a kilometer.  Just then I saw a flicker of movement high up on a sandstone cliff on my right. I stopped to look and there they were prancing about that sheer cliff, the blue sheep (Nayur or Bharal in Nepali). There were four of them.
Mesmerised, I watched those magnificent Himalayan ungulates as they perfectly blended into the cliff face with their fawn-colored hides. As Khasing hastily took out his camera from his backpack and took pictures, the sheep scampered off and were gone. Wow, that was fantastic! I cried out aloud.

We caught up with Shayeet and Diwas shortly. There were six other riders including Nishma (current women’s downhill champion, Nepal). The riders were from Czechoslovakia and had ridden all the way from Pokhara.
After the customary pleasantries (none of the Czech riders spoke English, though), I turned to the old lady dressed in a lama robe with a clutter of pots and pans and sundry scattered around.  She’d a kettle on a small fire beside. I learned later that that was her quarters.  She was a Lowa (Gurungs, Bistas and Biswokarmas) vagrant  moving south to warmer climate as winter approached. She was alone and came from some village near the Tibetan border. How a 65 years old woman could fend for herself in those remote and unfrequented places, all by herself, I wondered.  She offered us tea but did not accept to be paid.

After a brief stop, we bid the lady goodbye and set out; Nishma and the Czech group left earlier. The landscape got drier and isolated as we started on a gentle climb, the vast swathes of land around appearing like sand dunes of the rain-shadow desert of the Death Valley (watch video) and the Mojave in California, the United States.
After two hours on the dirt road, we began the climb to the Lo La Pass (3,950m) with a comforting feeling that it was our last. The wind seemed to lash at us with renewed intensity buffeting our bikes threateningly. The chill seemed to cut through the layers of our thermal wear and windcheaters to our bones. The fine dust and sand, on the other hand, made it difficult to see and hurt the eyes. Covered in dust, with puffy eyes and a bloated face caused by the cold, we all must have looked like apparitions from a ghost movie.
Dust, sand, or wind, we pushed on, stubborn and bullish, our heads low, heart’s pumping for more oxygen.  “Ravi uncle, we’re nearing Lo La’” yelled Khasing over the awful din of the gale. That sent my pulse racing like mad because Lo Manthang (3,570m) rested literally a stone’s throw away from the pass.
Good grief, with my breath coming in gasps, and the heart-rate doubled, I feared for a moment that I might get a cardiac arrest! No such thing happened, though. Moments later we crested the top. And there nestled against a vast expanse of bare rolling hills lay Lo Manthang, the erstwhile Kingdom of Lo . . .  and my long-cherished dream in all its glory. Sheer bliss!

Mesmerized, I looked, my eyes glued to the unfolding vista. In those brief moments, nothing else mattered or existed for me.  Suddenly, I wanted to relate my feelings in poetry but words failed me. Whatever, I realized then that dreams do come true . . . if you gave it a try.
It took about 45 minutes on the downhill spin to arrive at the large town gate. The Sun seemed to gently slide down the horizon as the distant rolling hills stood grey as somber silhouettes against the indigo sky. And the town seemed to bask happily in the outcome of the afterglow, the spectacle as much for the eyes as for the mind.

As we rode past the gate into the town’s main street with people going about their ways, my ears caught the distant pealing sound of bells and assumed that they came from the trotting horses heading back home after the day’s work.
Soon after, a dull, resonant sound of a drum punctuated by the sharp clang of cymbals and the haunting wail of a Dung Chen (a Tibetan long-pipe horn), unmistakably from a nearby monastery, followed us, as if in welcome as we checked into the Mystique hotel for a very belated lunch, or shall I say a brunch?
The evening in the dining room of the Mystique hotel was alive and abuzz with trekkers, cyclists, motor bikers and others. The hostess and other ladies in the kitchen were completely snowed under scurrying around taking orders, serving food but gracious enough to join in with the guests by quipping in a word or two. The noise was loud and we had to raise our voices to be heard. Everybody seemed in a festive mood and so were we.
After more than the customary two glasses of uwa liquor and filling dinner, we retired to our rooms, exhausted but happy.

Dreams are meant to be lived: to the enchanting Kingdom of Lo Manthang on two wheels,"Wednesday, January 30, 2019","At Gheling(3,570m), despite the cold high wind, my three companions decided to take a stroll around the village, still close to an hour left before dark fell. With a mild headache and fever-like chills, I chose instead to rest, huddled before the iron stove in the dining room of the lodge.  Sonam, the hostess, and Chhiring, her two-years-old son, who reminded me of my grandson, kept me company. The lovely boy, eventually, won the heart of rest of my companions, too.

Typical of all dining rooms of the inns and lodges we stayed on the way, the room that doubled as kitchen and dining appeared bare save for colourfully painted wooden tables and benches with rectangular woollen rugs spread over the top. One of the walls proudly displayed the framed photograph of His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama.
The boys appeared in about an hour when I’d sampled a glass of the heated local ‘Uwa’ liquor and went for the refill. The heat from the yak dung-fired stove and the drink really seemed to take the chill off. I listened excitedly to the sensational story they recounted to me.
At the red-painted Gheling Pal-Sa-Ngor-Tashi Choeling gompa (monastery), Kunga, the teen-aged postulant seeking initiation into Lamahood (monkhood), led my friends around. Apart from his passion to become a lama, his interests included painting and showed some of his works.
At length, he produced a small bundle swathed in red cloth and unwrapped it. What my friends witnessed then caught them completely off guard. The young monk held in his hand the mummified severed right hand, which he claimed dated back 500 years.

The guys stared at it, which still held a gold ring in the ring finger. “The hand belonged to the thief who entered the gompa and tried to purloin one of the many valuable statues. The custodian at the gompa foiled his effort, chopped off his right hand and handed him over to the authorities. There is one at the Tsarang gompa, too, ” informed Kunga.
Upon Kunga’s assent, my friends, still in disbelief, gingerly touched the preserved hand, but when they tried to take a picture, the young monk forbade them. “The touch felt real, nothing even distantly close to rubber or plastic, “said Shayeet and the rest stood firmly by him. Back at the lodge, Sonam confirmed the veracity of the story, already the local lore.

As they exited the monastery, an uneven pile of stone slabs with a sheep’s horn nearby caught their attention. As they examined closely, the heap turned out as inscribed mani stones; the horn too bore devotional Tibetan letters chiseled at the base.

Day IV
Windless and sunny, the morning proved beautiful the next day when we left Gheling and set out for Tasarang, 18km away. As the two red-painted gompas, my friends visited the other day, looked conspicuous high on the hillock, horses grazed at the foothill on a patch of grass.
To our great surprise, the road appeared wide and very smooth, as if, just compacted.  It, however, again turned rugged and gravelly after we hardly covered two kilometres. At first, the rocky road climbed gently from the valley across dun-coloured dunes filling the bare landscape but gradually turned steep. We rode along the isolated, rugged, treeless, and parched country listening to the wind and our own heartbeat.
As we stopped at Jhaite( 3,820), a small hamlet for a short break for tea and refreshment, the wind seemed to wake from its sleep. I became a shade apprehensive when Khasing informed us that we would soon climb the 4,020m high, Nyi La pass (4,020m), the highest on the road to Lo Manthang.

When midway to the pass, the wind lashed furiously at us. Working uphill called for a grueling effort as the air wore thin with elevation and the vicious wind threatened to knock us off the precipice.  At most places, we dragged our bike uphill accepting the ‘exercise in masochism.’
I made it to the crest little after my friends, gasping for air but nothing made me happier to know that I prevailed over the highest among all the passes. Even the howling cold wind biting at my face sounded like the orchestra to my ears.

Moments later, a group of motor-bikers tore up the road and stopped at the pass kicking up clouds of dust. Australians, back from Lo Manthang! We spent some time at the wind-torn pass to rest and exchange excited colloquy with them. The wind seemed to rip the colourful prayer flags and khadas off the pole held by a mound of stones and rocks–the sharp whipping sound clearly audible over the awful din of the gale.
And the skyline in the distance, from the east to the south, proudly rolled out the whole shebang of snow-clad peaks: the Thorung Peak, Kangsar Kang, Khatung Kang, Annapurna I, Tilicho peaks and the Nilgiri Peaks, the last two curiously always watching us from behind like ghosts as we spun along the long road to Lo Manthang.
“Dai, one of your friends has fallen off the bike,” called one of the Nepali bikers with the group. We rushed to the edge to see Diwas lying way down on the steep slope.
Fearing the worst, we rushed down to him on the treacherous scree-laden track. Luckily for him, he received minor cuts and bruises needing only first aid.  We did our best to patch him up but could do nothing about his busted right brake. Miraculously, he got back on his feet after a short rest, ready to hit the trail.
Our progress slowed down following Diwas’s injury and as he’d only the front brake to work on. Soon, another pass, the Ghami La (3,765m), loomed ahead. The pass proved deceptively easy, though. We peered over the ridge and sighted the sprawling settlement of Ghami, (3,510), the third largest after Lo Manthang and Tsarang.
The valley surrounded by groves of the native deciduous tree, the pencil poplars, the willows, and the scattered clusters of apple and apricot orchards gave the town a prosperous look.
Perched on an overhanging embankment, the large settlement of Ghami commanded in the southeast, a view of curiously shaped fluted sand-stone cliffs redolent of huge pipe organs adorning the ancient churches of Europe.
As we entered the town, extensive fields with the harvest-ready golden barley swayed in the wind and sun-drenched landscape. We stopped by a hotel called Lo-Ghami for lunch.
A pleasant surprise awaited us at the forecourt of the hotel. The place crawled with trekkers going to or back from Lo Manthang–a mixed bag with Germans, French, Australians, British, and some Nepalese (mostly motor-bikers). The biggest surprise included the Canadian ladies, the quartet we met at Samar. Equally surprised, they waved like mad at us.
Famished, we hastened to place an order for our routine dal-bhat. Good heavens! The owner told us that they had completely run out of food and seemed reluctant to cook at that hour. We bid a hasty goodbye to the ladies telling them we would catch up with them in Lo Manthang, and left.
Luckily, the lady at the home-stay just down the road agreed to prepare food for us. Ding-Dong, time for dal-bhat, and a much-deserved rest! Whoa! You should have watched Shayeet at the dining table. He ate like a pig (no pun intended buddy)!

We left Ghami around two in the afternoon. We rode past some crumbling chortens on a slight incline and dropped to a small stream with hardly a trickle. After a couple of kilometres, as we cleared on to flatter land, what we saw made us stop and literally gawk at it. What at first looked simply like a stone wall, turned out an impressive mani prayer wall (305 meters long), said to be the longest in Mustang, if not Nepal.

What amazed us most at a closer look was to find nearly every stone inscribed on its face with the six-syllable Avalokitesvara mantra: om ma ni pad me hum. Funny as it may sound, I started mumbling the mantra to myself; my subconscious seemed to prompt me.
And as dignified as they looked, towering wind-sculpted bizarre-shaped hills stood ahead in the east in the deepest hue of red with the sides in shades of grey, light blue and brown against the blue sky.
My imagination ran riot. It looked as if an entire army of men took up the Herculean task of hurling tons after tons off red, grey, blue and then brown paint over those craggy cliff faces. The time seemed to stop. And the atmosphere in that intriguing wilderness seemed to exude an uncanny sense of energy and powerful vibrations.
Little wonder, those hills and the long mani wall seemed steeped in mystery and legend. Going by the local myth, the story goes back to the 8thcentury when the emperor of ancient Tibet, Trisong Detsen, sought help from Padmasambhava also widely known as the Vajra Guru Rinpoche, to deal with the demon who wrought havoc on the construction of a gompa at a village called Samye in Tibet.
The demon frustrated every effort made by the monks to build the monastery and the work came to a standstill.  Pursued by the Guru Rinpoche, the demon fled deep into Mustang, Nepal. He, however, cornered the demon at Lo Ghekar and slew him there, the gushing blood spilling over the cliffs at Ghami and the intestines becoming the foundation for the mani-wall.
Guru Rinpoche then went onto build a monastery at Lo Ghekar. That 8th-century monastery is known today as Ghar Gompa, considered the oldest in Mustang. The Samye Gompa was successfully built in Tibet immediately following that landmark event. We could not visit the monastery as it did not lie on our way.
As we followed the road north, we noticed in the far corner another famous chorten called Khorok Chorten in a curious minaret shape.  As the jeep track wound up gradually, the strong wind, the clear sky, the warm sun, and the bare hills kept us company.  Soon the climb began, and we braced ourselves up for the Tsarang la pass (also called Chinngel la, choya la) at 3,870 meters.
At the top, we were greeted by the telltale flagpole held by a mound of rocks and stones (apparently a cairn) and draped with khadas and colorful prayer flags with prayer mantras printed on them.  The holy text on those flags stands for peace, compassion, strength, goodwill, and wisdom, as they.  The wind is said to act as the courier to spread those values far and wide.
As we sipped water and breathed hard to fill our oxygen-starved lungs, I saw something overhead. I squinted in an attempt to see more clearly against the bright sun.
And there they were, the Himalayan Griffons! Native to Mustang, these highland vultures (Gyps himalayensis) are pretty large birds and weigh from eight to as much as 12kg with a wingspan of 2.5m to 3m.
I watched in awe at those magnificent birds circling around soaring effortlessly on the thermals on their wide outstretched wings. The Himalayan griffons live solely on carcasses and carrion.  They nest in high cliff edges and even abandoned sky caves in Mustang and are often sighted at Chhuksang, Yara, Ghemi and other areas.
I tried hard to pick out from the group the Himalayan Lammergeiers (Gyapaetus barbatus), or the bearded vultures, a close cousin to griffons also found in Upper Mustang but I could see none at that distance.
As birds of prey, the lammergeyers scavenge like the griffons and live on high crags but surprisingly their diet consists of 90 per cent bones (the marrow being their favourite). Almost as large as the griffons, if not bigger, they are said to gobble up the bones after they are picked clean by the griffons.

The number of both the griffons and lammergeyers in the Upper Mustang region are on a rapid decline by almost 75 per cent. Despite the decline, both species are considered only near threatened on the IUCN Red List. “Perhaps, it’s time the authorities looked into it and reassessed their status,” argued Wangchhen  Lowa, or Ram Gurung as he is mostly known.
Also read: Lo Manthang: Exploring the Lost Kingdom on two wheels
A resident of Lo Manthang, he works at the ACAP office and has been with them for the last 20 years.  I met him during my stay in Lo Manthang. His wife, a charming lady, runs a prominent hotel called the Mystique Hotel in Lo Manthang.
“Lo in Tibetan dialect translates to ‘South’ and Wa stands for an ‘inhabitant.’ Sherpa, on the other hand, signifies ‘Sher’ as ‘East’ and ‘Wa’ an ‘inhabitant.’ ‘Sherwa’ is said to have degenerated later to Sherpa,” said Wangchhen Lowa as we chatted over a cup of tea at the hotel.
When writing about those vultures, I think a mention of “sky burial” commonly practised to this day in Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan would be relevant.   My jaws dropped when Wanchhen informed me that the same is still practised in Upper Mustang among the ethnic minorities called the Lowas. I listened in awe as Wanchhen, a Lowa by birth, filled me in with the details.
Sky burial as a traditional funeral rite has been retained from time immemorial in Mustang especially among the Lowas. When someone from the community dies, a high lama following religious funeral rites proceeds on to dismember the dead body into pieces and then offers them to the waiting vultures.
Curiously, the vultures congregate at the site, when the holy lamas carry out the funeral ceremony accompanied by the beat of drums and playing of the long pipe instrument. It is believed that by performing this rite the vultures transport the soul of the deceased to heaven. If a sinner, the vultures do not appear to feed on the dead body parts. Gruesome, but a stark reality founded on Tibetan spiritual values.

After a brief respite, we left the pass, free-wheeling down the windy gravel-ridden road.  As we took a bend in the hills, we spotted way down the sprawling large settlement of Tasarang. Set amid lush greenery and extensive fields of golden barley, a stark contrast to the surrounding bare, sandy and grey desert-like terrain, the second largest town after Lo Manthang, looked pretty imposing.
In about half an hour, we were riding past a large chorten with a walk-through built under its roof. Colourfully painted, the roofed chorten walls carried meticulously engraved figures of elephants, some kind of a winged god, a peacock and others.

As we rode through the town, we sighted two large buildings, one red and the other white standing conspicuously in the distance. As we got closer, we spotted a huge dog (presumably a Tibetan mastiff, do-khyi in Tibetan), sitting by the roadside close to the red building, which we learned later was the Tsarang Choedhe Shedrup Dhargyeling monastery.

As we stopped to look at the building, the vicious-looking dog eyed us suspiciously but stayed rooted in its place and just watched us. A little later as we rode past the white Dzong(fortress) white building, it looked in an utterly rundown state. That was the Royal Palace of the late King of Mustang, Jigme Palbar Bista.
The town path led through a maze of narrow lanes with white plastered houses as we arrived at the Maya’s Inn. The fading light and the orange glow in the west signalled that it was going to be dark soon . . .  and time we called it a day.

Nuwakot: A traveller’s guide to the historic town near Kathmandu,"Tuesday, January 29, 2019","

History tells you that at one point of time, Nuwakot was stronger than Kathmandu. That was the time when the old town was full of stone art. It was so pretty that people from all over Nepal used to visit the place. It was in Nuwakot that Prithvi Narayan Shah, the king who unified Nepal, began devising his strategy to conquer Kathmandu, in 1744.
The monarchy’s legacy and those of earlier dynasties can be seen in the monumental squares of the Kathmandu Valley and fortresses such as the Nuwakot Durbar – the seven-storey palace.
In the grand durbar, steep wooden stairs pass the queen’s dressing room, Prithvi Narayan Shah’s bedroom and a dark prison on the sixth floor. The seventh floor offers a bird’s eye view of Nuwakot village and the surrounding hills.
However, due to the 2015 earthquake and urbanisation, the historic structures around the area have suffered massive damages. The seven-storey palace looks as if it will crumble any day. Other temples and monuments around the palace are in a similar state.
The city which was once a powerful state in the Shah dynasty can still be regarded as an open museum to history students. Ten minutes’ walk from the palace will take you to Mahamandal, which is an important area from both cultural and historical points of view.
Even though the place has cultural importance, it’s crumbling. The sun and rain that fall on the old structures have made them weak and all of it is turning into ruins.

There are some homestay accommodation arrangements in the area whereas The Famous Farm is the only hotel. It’s an almost 100-year-old mud house that boasts a few city comforts. With a stunning view of the rolling hills and the royal palace from its wooden balconies, a hot shower and fusion cuisine, this place has been called “an ecoluxury hotel”.
The hotel administration says international visitors to Nuwakot are few in comparison with Bandipur and Gorkha, which lie along the highway that connects Kathmandu to popular cities such as Pokhara and Chitwan.

Nepali anthropologist and conservationist Harka Gurung, in his 1980 travelogue Vignettes of Nepal, writes, “[Nuwakot] was on a way of becoming a forgotten place. This historic place had already an air of abandonment and renunciation.” But Nuwakot hasn’t been entirely forgotten. Even Lonely Planet refers to it as “one of Nepal’s undiscovered gems”.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nuwakot-a-travellers-guide-to-the-historic-town-near-kathmandu.html,travel
Lo Manthang: The challenging ride to the land of the Lowas,"Wednesday, January 23, 2019","For me, the evening of day two at Samar proved tortuous. None but I was to be blamed for my near collapse at the Dajongla Pass that afternoon.  A full-blown diabetic, I knew I could not go on an empty stomach for longer periods, especially during a gruelling ride. Even a hardcore biker is supposed to replenish himself every two hours while on a tough ride.
As a precaution against acute mountain sickness, I even made it a point to buy some garlic (believed by village elders in Nepal to be a potent remedy against altitude sickness) at Jomsom, sucked on it and passed it onto my fellow riders.
Damn it all! I got careless and, of all things, forgot to stash my home-made multi-grain food into my backpack–a mistake that could have spelled disaster for me, something I did not wish to imagine.
Day III
I had to make a quick decision. We were only midway of our journey–to say nothing of five to six formidable passes still en route with one at an elevation of 4,000m plus. For me, that sounded very unnerving.  A much concerned Diwas even suggested I’d better not strain myself and make the rest of the journey in a jeep. I was torn by indecision, my confidence down in the dumps. I knew I could screw up the entire trip if something went wrong.
I hated to give up. I just wanted to do it. It was now or never.  Still, in bed, I chewed on the question for almost an hour in the morning. Then, I shut my mind off.  I decided I wanted to do it. I did not come all that way just to drop it in the middle, I reminded myself. God willing, my Karma would fall in with me. Shayeet was the happiest to learn about my decision.
After a hearty breakfast of tsampa porridge and eggs, we tried a novel item, too: buckwheat sausages (spiced buckwheat flour stuffed into sheep intestine). Tasted great! We left the lodge and took a short spin through the back alleys of Samar.
The small village of Samar at an elevation of 3,635m belied its rich vegetation.  It appeared greener with poplar and willow trees with apple orchards scattered around the settlement.  We even ate fresh-picked apples from one of the many orchards. I noticed small plots around the settlements, which held, to my surprise, green leafy vegetables too. Next, bench terraces of golden barley ran down the slopes of the village.

Under the rain-shadow of the two giants, the Dhaulagiri and the Annapurna, Upper Mustang hardly sees any rainfall almost all round the year. Whatever greenery we saw in and around the villages we came across was evidently a result of hard work put in by the local community undeterred by the harsh terrain.
During breakfast, we were joined by a group of three ladies, the ‘Canucks’ or the Canadians. They had trekked from Jomsom and were on their way to Lo Manthang like us. One lady, in particular, Caroline from Ontario City, east-central Canada, caught my attention as she was my age. We hit it off right away.

The back alleys of Samar like the rest of the villages we left behind were narrow, winding and partially stone-laid. Manes (prayer wheels), colourful chortens and mani stones, some inscribed and some simply painted with the six-syllable mantra of the Avalokiteshvara, ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ:  om mani padme hum seemed to be everywhere in the scattered settlement. Most of the houses seemed to fly white flags on the rooftop and hang sheep horns on the doorways.
We rode past women clad in their traditional dress (bakkhu) sitting in the forefront of their houses spinning yak or sheep wool while others could be seen with the prayer beads dangling from their hands performing kora (circumambulation)  around the gompa (monastery), which stood on a knoll close to the village.
Smiling children rushed at us calling ‘namaste’ and hung onto our bikes as we spun through the alleys. For them, every guy on a mountain bike was a foreigner. We came across a white painted house with red borders on the top with a window with painted glass panes. It served not only as a gateway but the upper story held a life-size mane (prayer wheel).
Shortly, we left Samar and headed north past a row of colourful chortens. A long vertical multi-coloured prayer flag flapped furiously. After a half hour on the climb, the jeep track then dropped to what looked like a stream. As we got closer, we realised that it was a rock-strewn stream that doubled as a road.

Khasing plucked up the courage to pedal across but got stuck less than midway as his tires slipped on ice that had frozen on some rocks. Rest of us chose to ford the stream by walking our bikes. Damn it! I cursed myself as I slipped on the snow and wet one of my boots ankle-deep in the freezing water.
For many motorbikers, it was like hell on earth. We helped a foreign guy out of that tricky stretch as he overturned his bulky BMW and was trapped under it.  “Every year this place sees many accidents and motorists dread it like anything; some even turn back,” said one of the local jeep drivers who had stopped his vehicle by the place.  Just like the driver said, it was indeed a dangerous spot as on our way back, we witnessed a smashed up jeep, which had slipped on the ice-laden slippery stream bed and skidded 15 feet down.
The road then climbed up by the side of a canyon with the rocky conglomerate. The higher we pedalled, the more the array of the snow-capped mountains got closer. To my dizzying senses, there stood in the horizon, among others, the massive Annapurna (8,091m), the Tilicho Himal (7,134m) and the Nilgiri North (7,061M).
The semi-arid desert landscape sans a single tree in sight continued with dramatic deep ravines and rock shelves. Only dark green patches of wild thorny grass and shrubby juniper-dotted the vast expanses.
As the gradient gradually got steeper going uphill, Khasing called, “guys, now we’re onto the Bhena La Pass (3,880m).”  That really scared me. To make matters worse, the wind started blowing savagely–biting and unforgiving.
I kept telling myself that I’d to clear the ridge one way or another, either pedalling or walking my bike. I somehow managed to the ridge wheezing, hardly able to breathe.  I finally made it to the small settlement of Bhena (3,700m), the last to arrive.
“One more weather to storm, guys–the 3,980- metre high Beg La (la in Tibetan stands for a mountain pass)–hitherto, the highest we have done, before we can reach Syangmochen for lunch,” announced Khasing.  At Bhena, we stopped at what appeared like the only tea shop for a brief respite to regain our breath, sip water and have some biscuits and a hot cup of tea.
While descending down to Bhena, we had to stop awhile on the way as the jeep track was literally blocked by a drove of goats and sheep by the hundreds herded down by three to four local hands.
Curious, I asked one of the herders where they were headed for and how long they were on the track. “We are coming from our village at Chhosar, Lo Manthang. It’s been four days since we started and might take more than 10 to 12 days by the time we are done with selling them. Since Tihar festival is just around the corner, we are on our way to Samar, Kagbeni or Jomsom. If we do not fetch a good price at those places, we go as far as Pokhara, and sell the lot even if that means incurring a loss,” said Tashi Gurung, the headman, who stopped by the teashop at Bhena and met us again.

After Bhena, the jeep track started climbing, a long ride up to Beg La. The bitterly cold winds were approaching gale force and to make matters worse, they brought along dust and sand. The climb as expected got stiffer as the dusty track switch-backed up the barren and dry landscape. We had no choice but to keep at it resignedly.
Surprisingly, I did fairly well, not as I’d feared. Only the elevation, the thin air, the cold blustering wind, dust-mixed sand, and the sun seemed to take its toll on me. I must have been quite a sight to look at with those puffed up eyelids and a weather-battered bloated face. If my wife confronted me then and there, she would fail to recognise me, I bet. Haha!
Phew! I finally made it to the oxygen-starved ridge, gasping for air. I became the last to do it, for all I cared. What mattered most was I did it. At the pass, the piercing howl of the gale seemed to blow my eardrums off.  My young companions complemented me for having completed the pass. That felt reassuring–a real boost to my confidence. The pass had a cairn, a disorderly heap of stones and rocks festooned with a string of colourful prayer flags and scads of khadas (a memorial silk scarf used by the Tibetan people or followers of Buddhism). The fury of the wind seemed to rip the snapping flags off the cairn.
Most high passes in Mustang carry those mounds of stones with colourful prayer flags to adorn them. Called, ‘dophung’ in Tibetan, and similar to the ovoos in Mongolia, these cairns serve as a sacred offering to the local deities. The passing local people and travellers often add a rock to it to show their gratitude.
While we took a brief respite at the pass, I tried to reach for my flask-bottle, but it was missing from my bike’s bottle cage. I realised that I’d left it at the teahouse at Bhena. Darn it! As we were still debating what we should do about it, we heard the pealing of bells followed by bleating of sheep.
Shortly, a flock of sheep appeared being herded by two guys. We told one of the guys about our problem and asked him if he knew Tashi Gurung, who we supposed would still be at the teashop at Bhena. Praise be to God, the guy happened to be a working hand for none other than Tashi and the small herd belonged to him. We took Tashi’s phone number from him and called. We asked him if he could help by sending the bottle through some motor-biker or jeep, which happened to stop by on the way up the pass.  He said he’d try.
We resumed the journey down the high cliff towards Syangmochen (3,800m). We spotted some glossy black yellow-billed alpine choughs on a cliff edge, which, after seeing us, took to their wings and soared into the updraft. The Alpine Chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is a bird in the crow family but their calls are distinctive, nothing like that of a common crow or a raven.
The gravelly road, then, zigzagged down by the side of deep canyons, the landscape still bare of trees and only patches of dark green dotting the slopes. After something like an hour, we arrived at Syangmochen surrounded by willow and poplar trees.

We stopped by a roadside eatery, which also served as an inn. We ordered, predictably, dal-bhat for lunch. As we rested a bit after the meal, I noticed a large black-and-tan Tibetan mastiff lazing in the sun in the forecourt of the inn. To my several calls of “bhote,” it did not as much twitch its ears. Just then, a cat leisurely walked past inches from its nose but still, it did not budge. Maybe the feline, too, was a family pet and they were buddies. Interesting!  But do not get misled by its diurnal indolence. Tibetan mastiffs can turn very aggressive to strangers after dark.
As we were just about to eat we heard the distant whine of motorcycles. Shayeet went to check and was back with my bottle-flask brought by a group of bikers on their way to Lo Manthang. Great! I badly needed it because it was impossible for me to drink icy-cold water.
Our itinerary included Tsarang for the day but as things stood, we were a little dubious about it for it was already past three in the afternoon when we were done with lunch followed by a bit of rest and what’s more, there was Nyi La Pass, at 4,020m to be crossed, the highest we had done thus far.
We left Syangmochen and began our gentle climb to the Syangmochen La at 3,850m. Lower than the Beg la, it posed no threat for me but the relentless wind and dust still made our pedalling sheer torture. The sight of the ridge was, however, comforting. The gravelly track then took a gentle descent past a colourful chorten into a valley and we had the view of the village of Gheling way down in a picturesque setting with its poplar trees and barley fields against the backdrop of bare hills.

As the afternoon wore thin, cold and weary, we arrived at Gheling (3,570m) at almost 4:30 pm. Going further to Tasarang was out of the question. Gheling became our stopover for the day.

Lo Manthang: Exploring the Lost Kingdom on two wheels,"Tuesday, December 25, 2018","We were done with lunch at Kagbeni at around 1.00pm. We rested a bit–a useful rule of thumb for every mountain biker to follow after a meal (dal-bhat is reasonably a large meal). It was almost 2 pm when we hopped onto our bikes. The itinerary for the day was Chele. Since we had to ride 18km for the day, we only took a brief spin through the narrow lanes of Kagbeni.
As the “gateway to Upper Mustang,” Kagbeni appeared busy. From this point on, foreign tourists are restricted to venture ahead unless they hold a special permit, which costs $500.00 for a 10-day trip, extra $50.00 a day after that.
We saw tourists with their backpacks milling around in the flag-stoned alleys. Children were having a ball running and chasing each other while men and women went about their ways with rosary or prayer beads dangling from their fingers humming to themselves the recitation of the Tibetan mantra, Om mane padme hum.
I learned later that because of the staggering government levy, many of the tourists confine their visit to Kagbeni only.

The maze of lanes seemed literally filled with hotels and cafes. Among a fleet of billboards, one large flaming red, in particular, caught my attention.
It read: Hotel Yac-Donald (like in McDonald’s). Maybe, they served Yak-meat burgers, I thought and wondered what they tasted like. The name sounded very outlandish to me and I chuckled to myself as I pedaled past.
In stark contrast to the modern houses that marked the hub, we spun past narrow alleys in the old part of the town to find what looked like more than 100-years old houses, built with stone and mud–some painted white, others red. We spotted Manes (prayer wheels) lodged into the stone walls at street corners and ran into an occasional chorten. It felt like taking a step back into the medieval times.
Literally, Kagbeni translates to Kag, a crow and beni, a confluence. A prominent stopping point during the trans-Himalayan salt trade between Tibet and India, the confluence of Kali Gandaki and Dzong river at Kagbeni is also considered a sacred pilgrimage. Hindu devotees from as far away as Kathmandu pay homage to their deceased ones by performing shraddha (a ritual performed on each death anniversary of parents and grand-parents) at the river bank and take a dip in the icy water. Some even try their luck in the rocky banks foraging for Shaligram (an ammonoid fossil dating back to the Cretaceous period more than 60 million years ago). The jet-black stone is revered by the Hindus as the symbol of God Vishnu.


As we spun past the main town, we had a glimpse of the Red Monastery (founded in 1429) prominently occupying the centre of the town. Another impressive sight was the Red House Lodge said to be a part of fortress ruins. The old part of the town held fortress ruins and crumbling houses believed to be hundreds of years old. At the outskirts, we spotted enclosed plots of apple orchard and the wild willow trees, which appeared ready for the autumn to turn into a beautiful golden hue.
By the time we left Kagbeni and hit the trail, the wind, as I feared and expected, seemed at its peak intensity. The sun was up but the cold biting gust seemed to swallow the warmth up. The howl of the gust seemed deafening and the dust it brought blinding. Pedaling against the gale seemed impossible and I’d to frequently dismount to walk my bike. My young companions were not doing any better and soon followed suit.
The jeep track led through vast expanses of barren undulating steppe vegetation dotted with thick patches of dark spiny green stunted scrub (junipers and other thorny species). Almost 300m below the Kali Gandaki cut across a sweeping sand and rock bed bifurcating like the tentacles of an octopus. Absolutely unblemished! The sight was awesome.
The vista continued to amaze me as we fought our way against the wind on a scree-laden gradient both riding and walking the bike as the need arose. As the track took a left bend on an incline, Shayeet and I stopped and dismounted because what stood towering before our eyes instinctively made us halt. Dumbstruck, we both gaped at the sight.
A row of sandstone cliffs with twisted folds flanked the right side of the road with a massive fissure in between. Khasing and Diwas joined us and after a brief respite we pushed on.
The landscape continued to be wild and awe-inspiring with rows and rows of fluted sandstone conglomerate cliffs as the track climbed up. The windswept Kali Gandaki valley kept us company all the way. After two hours, we did a stiff climb to what looked like a plateau. Then, the path dropped to the dry riverbed of Kali Gandaki and climbed again.

After a short climb, we arrived at Tangbe (3,060m) a small cluster of houses on a high ridge overlooking the Kali Gandaki gorge.
The wildly flapping colorful prayer flags called lungta in Tibetan dialect meaning “wind horse” strung at a ridge seemed to welcome us. I could see the barley fields, and poplar trees skirting the village. We pedaled past a large chorten colorfully painted in white and ochre supported by a roof. Some crumbling ones flanked it. The mud and sun-baked flat-roofed brick houses were in white and red. We also had fleeting glances of fort ruins.
It was already past four in the afternoon and we all realized we could not make it to Chele that day. “We spend the night at Chhusang today because it won’t be wise to bicycle after dark,” announced Khasing. We arrived at Chhuksang, in the fading light. Nestled in the confluence of Kali Gandaki and Narshing Khola (stream), the small village was situated at 2,980m. We checked into Braka Hotel.
I was exhausted as the day saw a lot of stiff climbs and a dusty whipping wind. It felt cold and I chose to huddle up near the fire stove that had a big kettle on. Surprisingly, the stove had only a few sticks of fire-wood for kindling. The main source of fuel was dried yak dung mixed with sheep droppings. They really worked up ample heat I noticed since the start of our ride that all the settlements on the entire trail had flat-roofed houses, painted mostly white with ochre brown, red or black borders or red sides and bore huge piles of split woods neatly stacked on the roof.
A young lady from a Tibetan origin seemed to be the boss and did all the work from cooking, serving food to showing us to the rooms.
An old lady and a girl gave her a helping hand.
We had egg and vegetable thukpa for supper but before that, I tried a glass of local alcohol distilled from uwa (naked barley), a staple crop of Mustang. From that day on it became my favorite. While my young companions chatted over their glasses (not Shayeet, he does not drink), I curled up in my bed. Brrr! It was cold.
Day II
We prepared to leave Chhuksang after a hearty breakfast of Tsampa porridge laced with shu-chya (Tibetan butter tea) and eggs. Having dusted down our bikes and the chains lubricated, we hopped onto our saddles. The path led through stone-laid narrow alleyways that zigzagged in between whitewashed mud and stone house walls and entered gate-like openings, where we had to duck our heads. Most doorways held above them sheep horns and skulls, a Tibetan religious practice, which is said to ward off demons and evils from harming the village.
We soon hit the motor-track as we left Chhuksang behind. The weather at around nine in the morning had a chill but the sun was up and there was no wind. The high precipices and sandstone eroded cliffs towering over the vast Kali Gandaki riverbed seemed to be painted red, orange and silver gray. The track virtually cut across the dry riverbed of Kali Gandaki sentinel on both flanks.

I could make out the ancient dug-out cave dwellings on the sheer cliffs, which appeared inaccessible. The cobalt blue sky appeared fleeced with wooly white cloud as we crossed a plank bridge over the
The jeep track led to more stunning sights of eroded ant-hill like cliffs, a real geological enigma.
After a short uphill climb on the desolate treeless terrain, the road dropped gradually to the riverbed with another of nature’s wonderful creation. The Kali Gandaki rushed here through a natural red rock tunnel formation as a massive rock the size of a building held a metal footbridge across. The rock held window-like hollows presumably caves the early settlers used as their dwellings.

After crossing the river and the gravelly bank of the Kali Gandaki, the jeep track then climbed upwards passing through a rocky gully towards Chele (3,050m). After a little past noon, the wind started gathering momentum. Pedaling up a steep climb for nearly an hour, we spotted a small settlement on a hillside that sported patches of barley fields and a little greenery. We had arrived at Chele. We stopped for tea, filled up our water bottles and took a brief rest. We decided to have lunch at Samar, some two and a half hours away.
From Chele the road switch-backed all the way up along the side of a steep canyon and seemed to continue with no sign of the crest in view. We stopped frequently to regain our breath and sip water. The grueling climb on that wind-swept incline seemed to tell upon me and I fell way behind my young partners. Then I realized that I was hungry.
Suddenly, things took a nasty turn. A massive dust storm hit us. It became impossible to pedal against it. I dismounted and started walking my bike but the wind was so strong and the dust so blinding that I took shelter under a big rock and huddled up against it. Visibility was reduced to less than five feet. A couple of bullet bikes zoomed past but stopped a little further up and took cover by the side of the dusty jeep track.
The gale continued in full intensity but the dust seemed to settle down after half an hour. The motorbikes roared to a start but as the track held almost six inches of powdery dust, skidded and could make it up the incline only after being pushed by the pillion riders. I walked my bike up the incline with no sign of my companions. I suddenly felt very weak and dizzy; my stomach groaned. Being a diabetic I had to replenish myself. I had to have something to eat but Shayeet carried the special multigrain snack-food I’d prepared myself for the trip.
Just when I thought and feared I was going to ‘hit the wall’ or ‘bonk’ (a condition when the body is exhausted of its glycogen stores, leaving you with abnormally low blood glucose levels) or lapse into hypoglycemia, Shayeet appeared. He came back to check on me while Khasing and Diwas waited at the crest. It took two small energy bars, three to four gulps of my multigrain powder, a liberal amount of electrolyte drink and a half hour rest before I felt strong enough to drag myself and my bike up to the crest of the hill. My two and a half kilos backpack weighed like a ton!
The ridge was marked by a rock cairn as it descended gently into a valley. A village called Ghyakar lay across the canyon to the west. Moments later as we left, Khasing told me that it was the Dajori La pass (3735m). The trail then descended into a gentle slope as we slid down a canyon into a side valley. After a long moderate downhill, we arrived at Samar (3,635m). The wind was still at its fiercest and its howl sounded like a banshee.
It was already 3.30 in the afternoon and we were pretty late for lunch. Still reeling under the horrible experience I’d at the pass, I ducked into the warmth of the New Himali Hotel located by the side of a small stream and a row of poplar grove.
Fortunately, the hostess at the hotel smiled broadly and said she could provide dal-bhat for four although the belated hour. By the time we were done with lunch, it was past four in the afternoon. Considering the harrowing experience I’d that day and already late to make it to the next habitation, Gheling, some 12km away, we unanimously decided to call it a day and spend the night at Samar.

Himalayan Marmot’s formula to survive high altitude constraints: Mutate,"Friday, December 21, 2018","The Himalayan marmot (Marmota himalayana) has always fascinated scientists and alpinists who travel to high altitudes.
The large squirrels dwell at elevations of 1,900–5,000 m around the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. At such altitudes, the air is thin and temperatures regularly plummet to below zero degree Celsius. But, these squirrels continue to thrive under such resource-scarce conditions.
Scientists studying the genetics of the ‘beaver-ish rodents of unusual size’ may have found an answer. Researchers from Jiaotong University Health Science Center in China, who assembled a complete draft genome of the animal, believe that the animal managed to thrive not just because the rodents hide in burrows some 30 feet deep for more than six months during the winter, but also because their genes mutated some two million years ago.
“As one of the highest-altitude-dwelling mammals, the Himalayan marmot is chronically exposed to cold temperature, hypoxia [lack of oxygen], and intense UV radiation,” Enqi Liu of Xi’an, the lead author of the paper, said in a statement.
When the researchers compared the Himalayan marmot’s genome to four other marmot species, it was found the Himalayan marmot’s line split from that of its closest relative rodent about 2 million years ago. The researchers, who compared the genomes of Himalayan marmots with genomes of Himalayan marmots that live at a much lower elevation, the difference was more significant. One gene, in particular, stood out from the rest.
According to the paper, Himalayan marmots that thrive in resource-scarce areas may have a mutation in a gene called Slc25a14. The researchers found that although other mammals such as mice, bonobos and other marmots, have one version of the gene, high-altitude-dwelling marmots have another version that may give them special abilities to survive in extreme cold.
The gene is believed to help control the function of mitochondria, the cell’s powerhouses. It is also believed it that has neuroprotective effects and plays a role in maintaining metabolism as well as temperature regulation–critical for animals living in the ‘Third Pole’. The researchers have a hunch that the genetic change may have helped the marmots adapt to their home in the Himalayas.
The finding could have implications for human health, argues Liu. The authors of the paper say that now that the distinctive genetic trait has been identified, this knowledge could be used to improve human adaptation in high altitudes.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/himalayan-marmots-formula-to-survive-high-altitude-constraints-mutate.html,travel
Fantastic Phoksundo: A trip to Nepal’s deepest lake,"Monday, December 17, 2018","
Ever since I watched the movie Himalaya (also known as Caravan), I always wanted to go to Dolpa and visit Phoksundo Lake. Having planned this trip more than once, 2018 became the year when I finally got a chance to visit Nepal’s deepest lake.
Dolpa district is now accessible by road, but the easier way to get to the Phoksundo Lake is via air. That is why we took a flight from Nepalgunj to Juphal, from where we started our four-day trek towards the lake.
After the 35-minute flight, we started our trek to Dunai, descending through maize fields and local villages. We walked along the bank of Bheri River and reached Dunai after four hours.
The next day, we were headed to Chhepka. The six-hour trail descends through the streets of Dunai and crosses a bridge over Bheri River. After few kilometres, we reached Shey Phoksundo National Park check post.

From there, we ascended along the rock-strewn trail and trekked further through a series of hemp farms until we reached Kageni. Relishing the views of waterfalls and lush vegetation, we made our way through the tropical forests to reach our overnight stop: Chhepka.
The next overnight stop from Chhepka was the Jharana Hotel which was around six hours away. Ascending through a forested path filled with big cedar trees, we climbed up through wide meadows situated above the gorge of Phoksundo River, from where we get a great view of a high waterfall and a faraway view of Phoksundo Lake.
The five-hour journey from Jharana Hotel to the lake descended steeply through forests filled with birch trees to the upper reaches of the Phoksundo Khola, from where we trekked through the shores of the lake.

My dream of coming to the lake had come true. What I liked the most about the place was how the water changed colours. It was blue one time and light blue a little later. We also learned that the lake was 650 m deep and isn’t home to any aquatic animals.
Walking around the place, we also got to see a waterfall coming out of the lake. The Phoksundo Waterfall is believed to be Nepal’s biggest waterfall.
We also learned that the lake sees a lot of French tourists.

The tourists generally stay at Rigmo Village, which has a few tea houses. However, the lodges haven’t been managed well, which has put a dent in the beauty of the lake.
The walking trail to the lake isn’t as great with lot of trees obstructing the way. Sometimes, it is quite narrow, which makes it quite difficult for tourists to walk. The mules use the same road which results in dirty trails and unhappy trekkers.
The people believe that enough has not been done to promote this area as a tourist destination. Lawmaker representing Dolpa, Satya Pahadi, shares that even though the place’s natural beauty is known to many, it hasn’t been getting enough tourists.
“This lake and the region’s natural beauty should be promoted by Nepal Tourism Board and its stakeholders. It needs to have sufficient infrastructure, which will make it easy for foreigners to come and enjoy the area,” she shares.

She also informs that the road is what most people complain about. “Tourists have nowhere to go after they visit the lake. There are so many areas which lack trail in the area” she explains.

Pahadi adds that a new committee should be formed for the conservation of both the area and the lake.
Dolpa is quite different, in geographical and cultural forms, from other districts in Nepal. It calls for a unique promotion strategy to develop the area to ensure that the tourists will have a value-for-money travel, demand stakeholders.

Lo Manthang: Cycling to the lost kingdom on the other side of the Himalayas,"Monday, December 3, 2018","“If you can dream it, you can do it”— Walt Disney
At the age of 66, my mountain biking trip to Lo Manthang, Upper Mustang, not only made me realise my dream and rise to the daunting challenges put up by the punishing and unforgiving terrain, but also curiously helped me rediscover my own strength and grit.
Believed to be a mystical Shangri-La, the 500-year old capital of Mustang, “the Kingdom of Lo”–Lo Manthang–was off limits to the foreigners until 1992. Today, the tiny enclave hidden within the folds of rolling mountains on the Tibetan plateau has become a destination of a lifetime for foreign tourists and Nepalese alike.
Some 15 years ago when I first saw pictures of Lo Manthang on the magazine pages and read about the place, they appeared surreal. I still remember old folks speak in awe about it as the “himal pari ko desh” meaning a land behind the Himalayas. For me, it seemed at the time, out of bounds, something of a dream.
After riding to Kalinchok(3,842m), Dolakha in 2014, I fantasised about a trip to Lo Manthang. I planneds for three years in a row (I had been to lower Mustang to Muktinath once with family and friends on a vehicle) and see for myself the “Walled City of Lo” (another name for Lo Manthang)–but it never came about.
But dreams can come true, can’t they? On October 20, 2018 I took a bus to Pokhara to fly to Jomsom, the kick-off point for Lo Manthang. I was to be joined by three other friends in Jomsom.
The flight to Jomsom itself was no less an amazing experience–scary too! The 20-minute flight, though short, afforded a breath-taking view of a panoply of snow-clad mountains.


The mountains appeared so close that I felt I could reach out to them! It reminded me of a mountain flight I did some 20 years ago when I literally gasped in awe to see for the first time the majestic array of the Himalayas including the Everest, literally a hop skip and jump away.

Whoa! A few minutes before preparing to land, the 18-seater Dornier banked to its left and my heart skipped a beat. I feared we were going to hit the side of the mountain that loomed ahead dangerously close.
All of a sudden, the plane shuddered violently as it flew low through the deep Kali Gandaki gorge. Full of trepidation, I held my breath until I saw the runaway tarmac zoom in at full tilt.
I sighed in great relief as the plane finally touched down.
Phew, that was close, man!  I said to myself.

Later, I learned that at this point, the Southerly wind that barrels through the Kali Gandaki gorge cutting through the great massifs like the Dhaulagiri and the Annapurna range gains a gale force reaching no less than 35 knots (over 65km per hour) in the afternoon.
The highest recorded wind speed by the Jomsom air-tower is said to have crossed over 80 knots (148km per hour).
Incredulous!
Mustang: another name for one of the deepest canyons in the world
The canyon walls south of the Jomsom airstrip (the flight-path after take-off), which soar to a stunning height from the riverbed are estimated at three miles or 6,000m below the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs. This narrow gully is also notoriously known as the “Great Himalayan Breach.”
Little surprise, the Pokhara-Jomsom flights are only scheduled for the mornings because of high winds that start in the afternoon and last until sundown. Despite the precautions, delays and cancellations of Jomsom flights are almost quotidian.
Strangely, it is not only the aircraft, but even the birds go through no less a harrowing experience while flying across the deep canyon.
If you are a bird watcher or a naturalist, you would be interested to know that Jomsom also happens to be one of the flight- paths for the wintering waterfowl, especially the Demoiselle Cranes or Karang Kurung in Nepali.
On their annual migration flight, they travel from the north as high up as the highlands of Tibet, Mongolia, and even Siberia to their wintering ground as far south as the Thar desert in Rajasthan, India.
Come late fall as the snowfall starts in the highlands, the migration commences and you can watch from the center of the town of Jomsom large flocks of these magnificent birds flying overhead in a V-shape phalanx.
When the cranes reach the narrow part of the Kal Gandaki gorge upstream from Tukuche and arrive at Jomsom, the strong southerly wind suddenly hits them disbanding their formation and sending them into chaos.
They eventually manage to spiral upwards with the help of the rising thermal current and fly across the gully to complete their epic journey over the Himalayas.
The distress calls made by those cranes are heard far and wide. Most of them make it but for some, it’s their last as the resident golden eagles lying in wait single out the unfortunate ones and swoop down on them. Wow, how I wish I could watch the drama in reality!
Located at the head of the spectacular Kali Gandaki gorge and set against the backdrop of towering Dhaulagiri( 8,167m),Tukuche( 6,920 m), Nilgiri Central (6,940),and the Annapurna (8,091m)m on one side, and the desert-like bare hills on the other, the small quintessential town, Jomsom (2,700m), was enough to make me fall in love with it.
After the balmy weather of Pokhara, there was a certain chill in the air while I disembarked from the plane at Jomsom at 11.30 in the morning.  I could already feel the strong gust of wind that slapped me as I made it to the terminal building. The Sun was bright and warm though, seemingly compensating for the cold wind.
Whoa! Jomsom proved to be a happening place, a hub of feverish activity.   The main street buzzed from early morning until late into the night with a constant stream of traffic including the walking tourists, the Boleros, the Scorpios and what appeared like a cavalcade of motorcycles.
The crowd in the street was no less, from dawn till dusk. People thronged the shops lining the main street buying local goods like apples, dehydrated fruits, zimbu( a highland dried weed used as condiment), churpi(dried yak cheese), souvenirs and varieties of apple and apricot brandy.
Surprise, surprise! I learned later that not a single hotel, lodge or inn in Jomsom bazaar had room to offer. All were packed to capacity.
“During season-time, it’s always like this, so to avoid such predicament, it’s best to book a hotel in advance from either Kathmandu or Pokhara” commented Khagendra Tulachan, the owner of the Majesty hotel where I stayed for the night.
Day I
My friends arrived by bus from Kathmandu in the morning the next day. Excitement writ all over our faces, we hastened to offload our mountain bikes. We considered our 13-day trip to Lo Manthang and the return ride all the way back to Beni, Myagdi nothing less than an epic journey. We could not wait to hit the trail! Well, ours was a mixed bunch.
Khasing Rai, aged 30, is a pro cameraman and runs a company called Montage Nepal doing all kinds of videos and photo-shoots: weddings, events, music video, and adventure sports. He loves to trek and ride his mountain bike. He is hung-up on doing crazy kind of things–recently did a trek to a remote place in west Nepal. The 13-day journey included walking bare feet for three days to an elevation of 4,600m. Crazy!
Diwas Pradhan, age 32, is an IT graduate but dabbles in event management under the banner of Pangro Trade & Service, Jhamshikel. He loves mountain biking. Come any cycling event staged in Kathmandu and you’ll find him there, one way or the other either as an organizer or a helping hand. He is also associated with Cycle City Network, Nepal–a youth-volunteered NGO fostering the idea of a cycle-friendly city in Kathmandu. His passions include computers and social work.
Shayeet Sharma: he is just a kid, only 18, a student. I got to know him as he is a neighbour. A bright and breezy lad, he is nuts about body-building. Other passions include playing football and riding his mountain bike. He wants to become a professional footballer and a bike racer (I wonder, how is going juggle his studies and his passions). To me, all three seemed ruthlessly ambitious. Must be their age, I mused.
Darn it, as we prepared to gear ourselves for the ride, we found that one of the bike’s tires, Shayeet’s, had a big gash, which was beyond repair! Now, Jomsom is not Kathmandu. There are no bike shops where you can buy a mountain bike tire.
I immediately sprang into action and rushed to a hotel where I’d been the other day and had seen a number of bikes leaned against a wall, not quite used by the look of them as some had flat tires.
We were lucky as one of the bikes was a 29er, the size of tire we needed. The hotel owner Mr. Tripple Gurung from The Om’s Inn, Jomsom, seemed only too happy to oblige us and a worried Shayeet beamed after the ruptured tire was replaced.
After a hurried but a filling and nourishing breakfast of buckwheat bread with honey, omelettes and a new item, tsampa porridge (made of local barley called Uwa, which became my favourite all through the entire trip), we set off for Kagbeni, the gateway to Upper Mustang, 11km away.
The kick-off!
Despite the chill in the weather, the 10 am sun shone brightly. The gravelly jeep track led us on a slight slope until we crossed a bridge over the Kali Gandaki river.
The road appeared quite busy as the jeeps kept passing us going up and down kicking off a cloud of dust. We waved at small groups of foreign trekkers walking with their hiking poles.
The Kali Gandaki river with its outspread riverbed kept us company all the way.

I’d my fears that the road would take a steep climb right from the start but save for a few moderate inclines, we were spared the hard stuff.
The landscape that met my eyes was something new and unusual for me.
The barren rocky terrain with patches of thorny dwarf shrubs appeared like pictures of the high deserts of New Mexico, the United States.
The stark landscape set against the deep indigo sky held a strange fascination over me.
From Ekalbhatti, it took only half an hour to reach Kagbeni, the gateway to Upper Mustang. The vista changed as we approached the Kali Gandaki river valley nestled in between looming bare hills as the murky water of Kali Gandaki cut across a vast swathe of a rocky riverbank.
Bhote pipal (the highland fig) trees and small enclosed apple orchards seem to enhance the stark beauty of the settlement. Sweeping plots of golden uwa (naked barley, a local produce of Mustang) fields on one side of the town announced its fertile soil and spoke of the industrious Thakali, Gurung  and Tibetan communities of Kagbeni.
We stopped for dal-bhat, our favourite. Needless to write, it remained our favourite for lunch for the rest of the journey. So far so good; I did quite well up till this point and kept pace with the young guys. I had my fears though. “It is just the beginning,” I reminded myself.

"Annapurna trekking: There are roads along with trails, but where do they lead further?","Monday, November 19, 2018","James Murray is one of over 100,000 people to have trekked around the Annapurnas this season. Like many, he came to Nepal because he’d heard it was remote; but when he saw dirt bikes in Manang, he couldn’t believe his eyes.
“I came here after my dad recommended this trek,” shares Murray, whose father had embarked on the same journey two decades ago.
“Things are a bit different from what my father had told me–he saw men in horses, but I, on the other hand, see dirt bikes. He had said that I’d be in the wild without cars, motorbikes or mobile networks. I guess it’s become more commercial which is not what I was hoping for.”
Two decades ago, the Annapurna Circuit was in the top 10 best trekking routes in the world, but now it’s not on the list anymore.
“I feel that is due to the road,” adds Tashi Sherpa, a trekking guide. “This part of Nepal was untouched by modern amenities. But after the arrival of the roads, people don’t think this trek is as pure as it used to be two decades ago.”
The tourists understand the need for roads around the Annapurnas, but feel it could have been done in a better way.
“Nepal is a developing country and these types of roads are a proof of that. Road access means life is simpler for the locals around the area, but what I don’t get is why the trails were hampered. I personally didn’t like walking on the jeep tracks, which makes up around 40% of the trail,” adds Murray.
Nation Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), an autonomous and not-for-profit organisation, mandated to work in the field of nature conservation in Nepal, agrees that the trail around the Annapurna Circuit shouldn’t have been damaged.
“Road access has made the lives of locals easy, which is a positive, but we do agree that hampering the trails shouldn’t have been done,” shares Bikhyat Sherchan, Information Officer at NTNC.
He also adds that it was the community which asked for the roads to put on the trail. “The community dictates what is to be done in the region and we just helped them out,” adds Sherchan.
The road from Besi Sahar to Khangsar is over 100 km long. Only raised four-wheel drives and motorbikes can travel these roads. It takes 12 hours to complete the journey travelling on snake-like roads at an average speed of 10 kmph.
The tiring ride from Besi Sahar follows what used to be one of the world’s best trekking trails, up to Thorung La (5,416m) on the Annapurna Circuit. Nepali passengers are charged up to Rs 3,000 for a one-way ride down while tourists are charged up to Rs 5,000. The exact charge depends on the season.
The road has both pros and cons. On one part, it seems to have made the life of the locals easy, but on the other hand, it has impacted tourism. Dil Bahadur Gurung, 45, shares that the road has been a boon for the community as it has made travelling easy.
“I can now easily travel between Chame and Manang,” shares Gurung, a local who has hotels in both places. “Earlier, I had to walk two days, but now I can just get on a jeep or a motorbike and travel between the two lodges in a few hours.”

He also shares that road access has made it easier to take the sick to hospitals and has made things cheaper.
But Dhiraj Lama, 60, from Pisang which falls in the Annapurna Circuit, adds that the road has its flaws too.
“I used to own a small poultry farm here and was doing quite good, but now with road access, everything comes from below. As they get things for cheap, no one bought chicken from me, which is why I had to close down the farm,” he adds.
Lama also adds that due to the roads along the Annapurna Circuit, the flow of quality tourists has decreased and the NTNC agrees with him. “It has lost visitors because tourists are disturbed by the roads. No one wants to walk on a trail where bikes and jeeps pass by every 10-15 minutes,” shares Sherchan.
Lama further adds that due to the road, the trek which used to take 18 days could now be done in seven, which he shares has impacted in many lodges closing down. “In those days there was no option but to walk, but now if you’re lazy you can just drive to Upper Manang which has affected a lot of lodges in the area.”
While the road has led to a drop in foreign tourists, it has resulted in a rise in domestic tourists who didn’t trek around that area before the roads were there. As motorbikes can easily reach up to Upper Manang, the region has seen a surge in domestic tourists.
“We don’t have the actual numbers, but the area gets a lot of Nepalis nowadays, which has helped businesses there,” shares Sherchan.
“They get up there on the bikes or on jeeps which saves them time. But that said, it is advisable to spend a couple of days in Manang and get acclimatised because the risk of mountain sickness is quite high when you jump altitudes like that,” adds Jeevan Lama, a hotel owner at Manang.
“The road has been important for the improvement of local communities. But, now we have to assess how it has impacted the environment as well,” adds Sherchan.
Even though the road has been a boon for locals living in Annapurnas, for trekkers like Uri Levy, it’s been anything but.
“This was my second time doing this trek and I’d read about how it had changed. It’s such a pity that you have ruined such a scenic trail. This area was so rich in culture and heritage, which with the road will surely lead to its demise,” adds the 60-year-old Israeli.
Meanwhile, the NTNC says it is aware of this and trying to promote new trails around the trekking routes around the Annapurnas.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/annapurna-trekking-trail-road.html,travel
Budhinandha Tal: As isolated and wild as it can get,"Sunday, November 18, 2018","Over the past decade, trekking in Nepal has witnessed a dramatic upsurge with foreign tourists taking the larger slice. Curiously, recent times have seen more and more Nepali enthusiasts venturing out to far-flung destinations such as Gosaikunda, Muktinath, Upper Mustang, Annapurna circuit, Tilicho, Langtang valley, Phoksundo, Annapurna base camp, Mardi Himal . . . you name it.
As it turns out, bitten by the backpacking bug, this wanderlust for the Nepalese appears not to be restricted to the established norms–some have gone even further with bolder ideas on their mind. Today, some of these new breeds of trekkers seem to have stretched this concept to the extremes, to whatever it takes to pull it off.
Recently, Khashing Rai and Shishir Raj Joshi, an adventurous duo, did an off-the-beaten-track destination in West Nepal, which dared to redefine the concept of conventional trekking.
Their 13-day trek to the Budhinandha Tal (lake), a pilgrimage site in one of the remotest part of West Nepal, Bajura, included almost 4 days of barefoot walking braving an elevation of 4,600 meters. No small feat, right? Sounded impossible to me!
“What really drove us to it was our passion and taste for the wild and untamed adventure far removed off the beaten track regardless of the hardships and high risks involved, “shared the duo their feelings and excitement with me. To me, it sounded nothing short of sheer madness and I cannot even dare dream of doing it ever. BRRRRR!!!!

The journey kicked-off with a 30-hour bus ride to Martadi, Bajura west Nepal, 400 km plus from Kathmandu, via Attariya on the East-West highway.

“Given the washed out road (in the pic), the pilgrims (including us) had to take a diversion by crossing a river to the waiting local jeeps to shuttle us to Martadi.”

“The trek started from the town of Kolti (1,300m) and we hit the trail that rapidly gained elevation. The ascent was steep and the uphill climb was grueling. In two days we would be at an elevation exceeding 4,000 meters.”
Day 2: Local pilgrims footing it on the barren highland meadows. At this point, priests from Nuri Gaon, stopped to gather all the members of the pilgrimage together ensuring that everyone was accounted for. The caravan proceeded after that at a slow pace.
The occasion happened to be the auspicious day of the annual Janai Purnima festival (the sacred full moon day of Shrawan/Bhadra, or August/September, when Hindu men change their janai (the holy thread) worn across their chests, especially the Brahamins and Chhetriyas.
Each year the inhabitants of Nyauli Gaon, Kolti and nearby villages of Martadi visit the Budhinandha Tal to celebrate this festival.

The trail leading into the mountains was completely isolated with no signs of habitation, tea-houses or even a single lodge, en route to Budhinandha Tal. Due to thick fog, the visibility at high elevations was reduced to no more than 5 yards. Further, this trail is shrouded in deep mystery as every year one or two local devotees are reported missing, never to be found again.

The priests from Nuri Gaon, close by Kolti, lead the pilgrimage and according to the local religious norms, none is supposed to go past the revered priests or break the group formation. Curiously, the priests and most of the devotees start on their bare feet right from the beginning, that is, from Nuri Gaon or Kolti. “Shishir and I shed our shoes at a place called Chhapre Odar.”
Resting point near Chhapre Odar: Here the devotees shared among themselves their water and food brought along from home. To go by the local religious belief, rice cannot be partaken of during the entire trip, so the devotees carry along eatables like roti(local bread), chiura (beaten rice), curry, achars (pickle) and the like. “We were lucky as the devotees offered food to us too.”
The diet also includes garlic and timur (Sichuan pepper), the local remedy for mountain sickness (locally called as lekh Lagne) or better known among the trekking fraternity as AMS (acute mountain sickness).
The religious rites at Chari Daha also include bratabhanda rituals, religious rites performed on young boys who have reached 14 years, announcing their entry into adulthood. According to the local belief, bratabandhas performed at the holy pond brings good luck to boys.

Stoically, putting up with the harsh highland hardships!  Pilgrims taking shelter from the rain with the aid of colorful plastic sheets. Rain was expected, but the surprising fact that you were not supposed to use an umbrella, was least expected. “Shishir and I wanted to put up an umbrella to protect our camera and gear from the rain but the priests advised us not to.”
Dhauli Odar–the last day of our trek to Budhinandha Tal. “While we pitched our tent next to the odar (cave), the devotees retired for the night in the cave, which surprisingly accommodated the horde of pilgrims, sheltering them from the rains.”
Women huddle together in the cave to fight off the cold. The temperature dipped below zero at night so to shake off that feeling, they broke into singing bhajans (religious songs) throughout the night.
The last leg of the journey on bare feet proved very tricky as it meant negotiating a steep climb on the face of a rocky hill, both slippery and treacherous.
Finally the destination! Budhinandha Tal situated at an elevation of approximately 4,600 meters. The devotees take a holy dip(at 4,600m !), perform puja and prepare for a hasty retreat to back home.
The air-strip at Kolti–an option if you wish to fly from or back to Nepalgunj.
Wow! That was one heck of a trek! Footing it bare-feet on a treacherous trail that went as high as 4,600 meters from sea level with nothing more than chiura and Wai Wai for lunch and no warmth of a bed of a lodge other trekking destinations offer at the end of a tiring day, it was just insane.
When last I met the duo, they talked about doing a new expedition, apparently a wild one . . . maybe wilder and crazier than the last! Nothing is predictable with the daredevil duo, Khashing and Shishir!  Maybe they’re already busy plotting their next big adventure to an uncharted godforsaken destination . . . right NOW!

Annapurna Circuit: Trekking one of Nepal’s best trekking routes,"Monday, November 12, 2018","The 3 am alarm is cruel for a morning person like me. I hit the snooze button and thought about the challenges ahead. I was about to climb 1,000 meters up to Thorong Pass (5,416 meters in elevation), then descend 1,600 meters to Muktinath. The pass would have to be crossed quickly to avoid winds. And, of course, it would all be done at an extremely high altitude.
The Annapurna Circuit
I was walking the Annapurna circuit, one of Nepal’s most famous treks that stretches for 300km around the Annapurna mountains in the Himalayas. The trek begins at Besi Sahar and climbs up to 5,416 m and ends at Muktinath.
Along the way, it passes through dozens of lowland and high mountain villages and some of the most spectacular natural scenery in the world.
Takes you back in time
Embarking on this journey is sure to take you back in time. You will get away from all distractions of modern society. There are instances to prove that the lifestyle of the people of the mountain villages are similar to what it was centuries ago. Gone are the sounds of cars, motorcycles, or machines of any sort. Replacing them are the sounds of rivers and waterfalls, of men porting goods or playing cards.
One will notice that most things around the area are made by hand. Until recently, everything had to be carried on the backs of porters or mules. Luxury items such as sweets and beer are available but at double the cost.
The road
On the first part of the Annapurna circuit, you walk on jeep tracks–it is no fun. But once you get far from the road, it does feel good. Sturdy suspension bridges that provide scenic vistas span many of the big rivers. In some areas, the trail has been ‘dynamited’ out of mountain faces, providing dramatic, thousand-meter drops to the valley floor below.
The view
The view does get amazing as you get higher up. The Himalayas are, quite simply, splendid. Every day as you go higher in the Annapurna circuit, the view changes and that makes this trek interesting.
One day you’re walking around green hills with Mt Manaslu behind you and you see icy rivers on the valley floors. The next day you see jagged cliffs towering in the background against a backdrop of crystalline skies. An embarrassing abundance of waterfalls cut deep trenches into the rock face.
People
The Annapurna circuit trail takes you through numerous villages that offer glimpses into traditional Nepali village life. The religion of the majority is Hinduism in the lowlands, and it slowly changes to Buddhism as you go higher up. The lifestyle of the people reflects Tibetan influences. As you climb higher into the mountains, Hindu icons give way to Buddhist prayer wheels and monasteries.
Most people we encountered were genuinely pleased to see us and greeted us. But there were a few who were not as pleased, and didn’t like domestic tourists.
Porters on the Annapurna circuit trail, who were carrying loads between 15-25 kgs on their backs never complain. With a smile on their face, they carry on. Glimpses of smiling kids who ask for chocolates is a common sight as is getting passed by 60-year-old grandmothers.
Tea Houses
Most of the villages we passed through had lodges geared toward trekkers. The lodges are simple wooden huts with thin mattresses, clean sheets, and decent duvets. The rooms cost around 200 for domestic tourists and 500 for foreigners.
Dal Bhat power 24 hour
The range of food on the Annapurna circuit trail was surprising. From Nepali specials to the continentals, you get it all. But the only meal we had on the trip was dal-bhat for lunch and dinner and buckwheat chapatti for breakfast. Even though it did get a bit monotonous, but trying a lasagne at 4000m prepared by people who’ve never tried them wasn’t something I was willing to do.
Regardless of food quality, I managed to eat at least three times a day. I had no idea that I could eat as much.
The best thing about this trail is yak cheese, which tastes like a fine parmesan and enhances every meal imaginable. Seabuckthorn juice, made from a local berry that tastes like apricots, was another stellar treat.

Reaching Higher Ground
The scenery changed for the better as we climbed higher up the Annapurna circuit. The wind helped us see crystal clear blue skies and snow-capped mountains. Up above the tree line, the scenery transformed into a barren, Tibet-like landscape of brown hills, landslides, and jagged peaks.
The air got considerably thinner above 3,000m mark, which made steep climbs and rigorous efforts more difficult. But, although thin, the air felt so pure and fresh.
Freezing Cold
The temperature during the night changes dramatically. The only way one can escape it is by layering up. The rooms have no heating which means a down sleeping bag and a down jacket is a must.
The wind gets frosty above 3,500m which makes walking around quite tough. Still water freezes at night which makes going to the toilet quite weird.
On the bright side, a week of freezing nights provides a great incentive to get over the pass and down to lower elevations as quickly as possible.
Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)
While heading to Yak Kharkha from Manang my friend had signs of AMS. Dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea made him take his meds. It was quite shocking because we felt we had acclimatized quite well.
We also heard about a porter dying in Tilicho Lake, which is also a major attraction of the Annapurna circuit. The incident was an eye-opener. The porter had crossed Thorong La 12 times; he was a certified, professional guide. That is why it is better to be safe and carry medicines or better take three days before going to higher altitudes because AMS can strike anyone, regardless of age, experience, or health.
Thorong La
The first hour hurt the most. The climb from Thorong Phedi to high camp is impossibly steep, utterly unforgiving and doing that at 4 am wasn’t great. Fighting for breath in the thin air, I’d pause every few meters, gaze up the unending mountainside, and indulge in a moment of self-pity. Then I’d stare back at the ground and put one foot in front of the other.
I felt my strength and optimism rising after an hour of climbing. I no longer had to stop as often; I was even able to make some breathy chatter with the people we passed.
Past the 5,000-meter elevation mark, the air became impossibly thin and dry. I had to pause every few meters to regulate my breathing.
Just as I was growing paranoid about my health, I glanced up and noticed some colours peeking out over the top of the cliff – prayer flags marking the pass. My shallow breathing and worrisome heartbeat fell away as I scrambled up to Thorong La.
Success
Thorong Pass is marked by a large stone pile spotted with prayer flags. Commanding mountain views greet visitors from every side. Magnificently, the surrounding mountains appeared to be at eye level or lower. I felt I was on top of the world. I’d reached the highest point of the Annapurna circuit.
Downhills Killing the Knees
At first, the decent from Thorong La was thrilling. The relief we all felt to have made it over the pass was obvious. I could feel the air growing tangibly thicker with each leap and bound down the mountain. And the prospect of a cold glass of beer at Muknithath was motivational.
The pure hell of descents came into sharp focus after an hour when the cartilage in my knees felt like it was crumbling. The 1,600m descent took its toll. Toward the end, I hobbled down the trail like an old man who just had knee surgery using my walking stick as a cane.
The Other Side
Most tourists who’ve done the Thorong Pass often trek towards Pokhara but as we were short on time we decided to take a jeep. The road up to Jomsom was quite nice but it started to get a bit crazy and after a 10-hour journey, we reached Pokhara.
Into the wild
After spending most of my time in Kathmandu, the Annapurna circuit trek was refreshing. I was away from pollution and the hectic city life.
What I felt was the Annapurna circuit trek has everything: culture, natural beauty, welcoming people, physical challenge, and value for money. The Annapurna circuit which is my first real trek was the most fun I’ve had even though it was physically straining and is probably the highest point of my life.

The ‘gunfire’ pond: Why you should visit Timbung Pokhari in eastern Nepal,"Monday, November 5, 2018","
Four days away from Kathmandu lies Timbung Pokhari, a religious pond at an elevation of 4335 m. The pond borders Taplejung’s Sindingwa Rural Municipality and Panchthar’s Yangwarak Rural Municipality.
The name ‘Timbung Pokhari’ originated from a Limbu word ‘Timbak’, which means the firing of a gun. The locals gave the pond this name as the pond often makes a sound that is similar to that of a gunfire.

Majestic views of Kanchenjunga can be seen close from the pond which is 466 m in length and 154 m in width.
Even though the pond is covered in snow for six months every year, hosts of pilgrims have been visiting this pond to offer puja for a few centuries now. Pilgrims gather around the pond, especially during the month of Shrawan (July-August) and during festivals like Janai Purnima and Nag Panchami.

It is believed that by offering a puja in this pure pond, wishes of pilgrims come true along with their lives being filled with peace and happiness. But the locals also believe that bad things happen to the visitors if they have sin, greed and jealousy on their conscience.

The locals believe that the magpies around the area clean the pond on a regular basis. They also add that things that are in the pond or are being offered to the pond shouldn’t be taken away. Locals connect the death of 12 foreigners recently with the myth.

The journey from Kathmandu to Timbung Pokhari can take up to four days. If you wish to spend a day at the pond, it will take a total of nine days.
It takes two days on foot to reach Timbung from Chyangthapu, the starting point of Mid-Hill Highway. Due to the unavailability of road, the only way to reach the pond is walking.

People from different places of from Nepal and other countries visit Timbung Pokhari. As the pond is quite close to India’s border, it sees a lot of Indian pilgrims throughout the year from places like Manipur, West Bengal and Sikkim.

The pond is both unique in natural beauty and biodiversity. The area around the pond is home to various rare flora and fauna and is also known as the capital of herbs. Valuable herbs like bikham, kutki, padmachal, jatamasi, panchaule and yarsagumba can be found in the area along with aromatic herbs like sunpati, bhairungpani and sikpale.

The place is also home to animals like Himalayan monal, Himalayan blue sheep, Himalayan goral, bear, snow leopard, musk deer, red panda and many more.
The best time to visit Timbung Pokhari is between March and October. Mid-July to August is even better to get there and witness the unique culture of the area.

Having seen its potential, the local government is now working at promoting the place hosting various fairs in the area. The pond has also been featured on the list of 100 new tourism destinations that the federal government published few days ago.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-gunfire-pond-why-you-should-visit-timbung-pokhari-in-eastern-nepal.html,travel
Chitlang: The historical valley on the Rolls Royce trail (Part II),"Friday, November 2, 2018","
The next day, the Chitlang valley appeared verdant green in the early April morning with a glorious sun to match the country landscape. From where we stood, thick forests blanketed the hills to the North, East and the West, while to our South the view spread out into expanses of terraced field and a dirt road passing through the middle to the town. Small pockets of houses, mostly stone-roofed, were scattered around. The landscape seemed like a freshly done painting.
The forest-clad hills around was protected and looked after by the village community. The rich vegetation included: temperate varieties like pine, chilaune (needlewood), phanlat (oak), lapsi (renowned for its small fruits called hog-plum), utis (alder), and katus (chestnut). Rich in flora and fauna, the forest boasts more than 160 species of birdlife. Chitlang is also recalled for delicious peach farming.
While Shayeet left to take a stroll around, I struck up a conversation with some teachers who’d stopped for tea at the home-stay. The school was located right next to the home-stay. I learned that the old crumbling building within the school premises, which had survived the 2015 earthquake, was built by the Rana Prime Minister, Chandra Shumsher (fifth Prime Minister of Nepal, 1901-1929). Before the advent of the Tribhuwan Rajpath Highway, the building served as a guest house for Rana elites and dignitaries who stopped for the night on their journey to and from India.
After breakfast, our host, Rita Singh Thakuri, took us on a tour of her goat cheese factory. Chitlang is the first and the only village in Nepal to produce goat-milk cheese. The goat cheeses, soft and hard, sell in star hotels and restaurants of Kathmandu. We also visited the goat farm run by her and her husband, Ashok Singh Thakuri. The goat cheese has made a reputation for itself and when Chitlang is mentioned, the name of the cheese factory crops up spontaneously. Obviously, we got the chance to taste the cheese served for breakfast, yummy!
A town steeped in history
After a customary check and dusting off our bikes, we took leave on a tour of the town. First, we stopped at an old settlement called Majh Gaon, a Newar village said to be as old as the hills around. Majh Gaon housed the renowned chaitya built by Emperor Ashoka of India during his tour of Nepal during the Kirat dynasty (800 BCE–300 CE). He was on a peaceful mission to disseminate the principles of non-violence and the teachings of Buddha.
“It is believed Chitrapur (ancient name of Chitlang) was renamed Chaityalon, chaitya (monument) and lon (path) in Newari, after this monument was built. Over the years, the name got misquoted as Chitlang” said Santa Lal Newa, a 71-years old gentleman, who is an authority on the history of Chitlang. Later, I learned that he had penned a few books in Newari dialect on Newari culture and religion. “There is also a different opinion, which claims that Chitlang being very close to Patan, got its name from Chi (meaning short) and lan (path). The term Chilan is still used in Newari verses, but the first name of Chitlang was Ek Chakri Nagar, to go by the oldest history of Chitlang,” added Mr. Newa.
As we walked our bikes through narrow alleys, I was suddenly gripped with a sense of déjà vu. The surroundings seem to spark my memory that I’d seen them or been there before. Then it suddenly dawned on me that I was somewhere in the back alleys of Bhaktapur or Madhyapur Thimi.
The men and women too looked familiar — men in their suruwal (tight trousers), shirts, waistcoats, and the ubiquitous black Bhadgaunle topi (the national cap), and women in cotton checkered blouses and black fariya (traditional dress) with red borders.
Chitlang town is predominantly inhabited by the Balamis (ethnic Newars). As the legend goes, a large group of newar people from Bhaktapur for contracting smallpox was banished from the Nepal valley by the King of Bhaktapur. During that mass exodus, a child was born to a woman in the middle of a road. Myth has it that the Balamis got their name Bala (middle) and mi (person) for that reason. I spoke Newari to some and found theirs very similar to Bhaktapur’s–the reason being obvious for their origins. The accent and the diction, however, slightly differed from that of Bhaktapur.
Apart from the Balamis, Chitlang is resided by another major community of Newars called the Gamals. Curiously, this community, originally from Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, had the same fate as their cousins the Balamis. To go by the local myth, this community once served the royal kitchen in ancient Patan and Bhaktapur but was ousted for misconduct by the Malla Kings and sent to live in the villages. ‘Gama’ in Newari language translates to ‘a person from the village’ and it is speculated that the community derived its name from this word.
Since Chitlang, for the most part, is populated by Balamis and the Gamals of Bhaktapur and Patan descent, the small town hosts similar Newari cultural festivals of Kathmandu each year, the Kartik Nach (the legendary dance performed in Patan, Lalitpur in Oct-Nov), the kojagrhat dance, Bhairab and Mahadev jatra and Khadga jatra being the popular ones. Other minorities in Chitlang include Brahmin, Khas(Chhetri), and Tamangs. Some of the famous temples of Chitlang include, among others, the Kalidevi, the Swachhanda Bhairab, Bhandarkharka, and Bhimsen Mandir.

The Ashoka chaitya in Majhgaon bore a stone inscription that dated back to Sambat 45 of the Lichhavi Era (between the 5th and 8th centuries AD), proclaiming Udayadev as the king of Chitlang. I’d like to relate a small incident that took place at the chaitya site, quite a hilarious one. Before setting out on our trip, I happened to look up on the Internet for some info on Chitlang. In one of my researches, a website clearly mentioned that next to the Ashoka’s Chaitya or Stupa, Ashoka also built a metal pillar that stood nearby.
To my great consternation, I could not find one although both Shayeet and I looked all around. Just then I spotted one local guy sitting by the stupa smoking a cigarette. I approached him and asked, “Bhai, where is the Ashoka’s pillar located, I can’t see it around here.” The guy first looked me up and down and gave me a quizzical look. I’d to repeat my question again. “What pillar,” he asked sounding irritated. I repeated again and this time he really went mad at me. “What on earth are you talking about? I was born and brought up here and I know nothing or even heard about a pillar” retorted the guy rudely. I chose to back off. Mind you, the info on the Internet can be misleading at times!
Next, we visited the perennial Sat Dhara (literally, the seven stone waterspouts)—the main source of water to a number of settlements in Chitlang. The water spouts, however, had completely dried up after the 2015 earthquake. The site was overgrown with weed and wild grass and looked abandoned.
We left Majhgaon, and pedaled up to Gurujudhara, located at Tagatar. The ancient stone spout calls to mind the great poet, Laxmi Prasad Devkota, who penned his poem Yatri (traveler) sitting beside Gurujudhara while he was in Chitlang. Right next to the spout a path led down, which was a part of the old walking trail of the yore. “That path bustled with life and trade in the village flourished in the old days, before the Tribhuwan Rajpath came,” said Buddha Ratna Manandhar, a retired school head-teacher who also runs a home-stay facing the renowned stone-spout.

We rode the ancient trail a little way down, which eventually met with the main motor road. In fact, we intercepted the old footpath at several places while riding around Chitlang. We stopped at Narayanhiti, named after a shrine of god Narayan (Bishnu), a stone spout close by. The place was in shambles–a bleak aftermath of 2015 earthquake. The place needed a complete reconstruction. We continued past quaint little dwellings at Tupikhel and Kushlechour; a small rivulet called the Chitlang kusi (river in Newari) ran a little down the road to our left.
Next, we pedaled uphill to see the reputed Shivalaya way uptown to Mathilo Pauwa on the way to the Chandragiri heights. While looking at the Shivalaya completely finished in stone bricks, I was reminded of the Krishna Temple, Lalitpur. The interior of the temple was even more awe-inspiring. What struck me most was the roof–all carved in stone, which spiraled up in some kind of a geometrical pattern–a unique specimen of ancient architecture.
Toukhel
After lunch, we rode to Toukhel, another town renowned for ancient inscriptions and relics. We stopped on the way by the ruins of the historic kot (fortress) built by the Malla Kings (10th–18th century)—only old bricks and some artifacts remain. Toukhel (6 km from Chitlang), is predominantly resided by the Gopalis, yet another ethnic Newar community. I could not understand a word of it when I heard them speak. The Gopali dialect is different from the Balami or Gamal tongue—and not is only remotely close to Kathmandu or Bhaktapur Newari.
The Balamis, Gamals and the Gopalis, all Newars, live in such close proximity, but when it comes to their language, they are way apart.
We happened to meet a teacher at the local school, Rudra Gopali who volunteered to take us around the village. Toukhel (‘tou’ big and ‘Khel’ a big ground (in Newari) is exclusively resided by the Gopalis. “We are the descendants of the Gopal era (before 300 A.D.) and milkmen or cow herders by origin,” informed Rudra.
Life in Toukhel seemed laidback and timeless. Men and women going their way with their kodalis (digging tools) and dokos (conical-shaped dry bamboo strip hand-woven baskets), rice paddy laid before the houses to dry in the sun, bunches of chilies, corn-cobs and strips of sliced radish hanging by the roofs and buffaloes masticating by the neat piles of straw. For the second time that day I was reminded of being not in Toukhel but somewhere in Bhaktapur or Thimi.
Next, Rudra took us to an ancient stone inscription dating back to the Lichhavi era. “The Gopalis originally belonged to the forests. The letters on the inscription were an appeal made by the Gopalis to King Amshuverma (6th century AD) to move their residence to Toukhel instead of the dreaded forests. It is also said that King Udaya deva (621 AD), the then King of Chitlang, donated the present land to the Gopali community,” said Rudra.
Nearby villages to Toukhel included Bisingkhel, Nhulgaon, and Kunchhal. As our tour neared its end, Rudra pointed to a distant clump of trees, which he explained was the jaitun (olive) plantation and oil extraction center, the Himalaya Plantations Pvt. Ltd., a Nepal-German joint venture, set up in 1994. We wanted to see the factory but it was already late in the evening and the visiting hours were over. We thanked Rudra and left for Chitlang.
Next morning, after a ceremonial tika and a garland from the host, Rita Singh Thakuri at the homestay, we bid her goodbye and set out on our mountain bikes on the long journey to Kathmandu with a treasure trove chock-full of ancient history of Chitlang and fond memories of the trip to cherish back home. Last but not least, we felt proud to have spun our wheels on the historic Rolls Royce trail.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Kathmandu-Phakhel-Kulekhani-Markhu-Chitlang circuit is a well-used track by mountain bikers (130km). Recent times have seen hikers both foreign and Nepali frequenting the route via Thankot to Chitlang). Buses and public jeeps are available on Phakhel-Pharping, and Chhaimale-Dakshinkali road. For hikers, motorbikers and mountain bikers, the route to Chitlang from Thankot is the shortest (27km). For accommodation, basic lodges, modern resorts, home-stays, tea houses and eateries are plenty to be found in Chitlang. 
According to the Tourism Board, Chitlang is gradually turning into a tourist hub, drawing over 1,000 domestic and foreign tourists every week. The recent operation of cable-car to the Chandragiri heights has also helped boost tourism in Chitlang. From the Chandragiri heights, it’s like a 45-minutes downhill hike to Chitlang.

Chitlang-the historical valley on Nepal’s Rolls Royce Trail,"Monday, October 8, 2018","
Yes, curiously, it also came to be known as the ‘Rolls Royce’ trail as the first ever automobile (in 1934), and subsequently, others owned by the Kathmandu’s royalties, foreign dignitaries and aristocrats were transported by this route–not on wheels but shoulder-borne by porters.
The villagers thronged to watch the spectacular sight as the porters carried the car balanced on bamboo poles to the rhythmic chanting of ‘hoste-hainse’ (Nepali rallying cry).

In 1940 porters numbering 60, carried a 1939 Daimler-Benz gifted to King Tribhuvan by the then German Nazi Leader Adolf Hitler. The vintage car is kept on display at the Narayanhity Palace Museum. Yet another antique car, the Hudson Phantom, made by the Hudson Motor Car Company, Michigan, Detroit, USA, and brought to Nepal in the mid-1900s ( believed to be Late King Mahendra’s), is on display at the National Museum, Chhauni.
Some 70 years ago, my nonagenarian mother (93 years old now) walked along this ancient trail, when she was a young woman in her early twenties. She was on a long journey to India and back to meet my late father who was stationed in the Nepal Embassy, Delhi. So did everyone on this trail.
For millenniums, even before the dawn of recorded history in Nepal, the trail was trodden by the traders, pilgrims, royalties, foreign dignitaries, monks and commoners alike because that happened to be the only route that connected the Valley of Nepal (Kantipur/Kathmandu, Bhadgaon/Bhaktapur and, Patan/ Lalitpur) with the Terai plains and neighboring India.
The ancient trail
In the mid-1900s, the journey began after a motor vehicle called a lorry shuttled the travelers to Thankot. Afterward, they hit the foot trail to the daunting heights of the Chandragiri hill, which traversed across beautiful villages like Chitlang, Markhu, Kulekhani (a suspension bridge spanned the river then), Chisapanigadi, and the last leg to Bhimphedi. After that, people clambered up a lorry again and left for the terai towns like Hetauda, Amlekhgunj, and Birgunj, the gateway to India.
In 1956, this time-honored beaten path, trodden down for centuries by legions of travelers suddenly turned deserted and a deathly hush fell over the villages along this route. The once bustling settlements turned quiet and isolated . . . like ghost towns. All too soon, the centuries-old dusty footpath over the Mahabharat hills was forgotten and sadly ignored.
In April 2018, Shayeet and I decided to go on a trip to Chitlang, planning to take the return route via Fakhel, and Pharping. We wished to do the ancient Thankot route but as the road widening work was in progress, it was closed for traffic. Instead, we chose the Mata Tirtha dirt road, which climbed to the Deurali Bhanjhyang (the adjacent ridge to Chandragiri) but eventually met with the ancient trail at Kulekhani. We did not foot it like our ancestors did but mountain biked instead.
What with the traffic snarl-ups at Kalanki and convoys of heavy vehicles that seemed to bore down on us, the first leg to Gurujudhara proved tricky, needless to mention the quantity of dust and noxious exhaust fumes our lungs must have inhaled en route. Just horrible! At Gurujudhara, we took a left turn and sighed in relief as we headed out towards Mata Tirtha, a Hindu shrine thronged each year by devotees on the mother’s day. The road though paved was rutted and in a bad shape. The ride began with a steep climb. Save for a few houses and tea shops, the signs of human habitation started thinning out after we pedaled a kilometer uphill. After some time the road turned into an off-road motor track.
We were told that the rest of the forest-clad hill to the Deurali heights (2,100m) would be deserted, so we stopped for tea and snacks. I looked up at the towering forested hill and my heart sank. We had to slug it up to the steep dizzying height without a level ground in between. For Sayeet (only 18 years old) it would be like a fun ride but for me, aged 65, it would be punishing. That’s mountain biking! I was ready to take up the challenge!
With nature
The more we pedaled uphill, the denser the forests got. Tall pine trees spiraled up into the high hills. The lush vegetation appeared like a close-woven carpet of pale green and olive, while a dash of needle wood magenta foliage lent a floral motif to the pattern. The climb continued relentlessly and the going got tougher each second. Even the “granny gear” (the easiest gear) did not help, and I had to dismount at several places, regain my breath and walk the bike. On the other hand, Sayeet took it in stride. “Must be age,” I murmured to myself, my breath coming in gasps.
We stopped now and then to sip water and gaze around. Several spots on the hill offered bird’s eye views of Kathmandu valley—once a fertile bowl, now an untidy clutter of concrete, grey and dull to look at. The sight was pathetic–what with the haze and smog that seemed to smother the life of the valley, once so green and beautiful.
It took us a grueling three hours from Mata Tirtha to crest the Deurali ridge. We stopped for lunch. Lying towards the west, we could see the Chandragiri ridge and the cable car station. The cable-car cabins were moving up and down. The north was overcast, the dull grey cloud denying us a view of the mountains normally seen on a clear day. In favorable weather, both the Chandragiri and Deurali ridges offer a sweeping view of Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Dorje Lakpa, Gaurishankar, and even the mighty Everest.
It was time to hit the trail, as we had not made even half the journey. After Deurali the downhill was a breeze, freewheeling all the way down to Chakhel, a settlement dominated by the Tamangs. We hurtled down past small settlements and were surprised to find the terraced slopes bedecked with cabbages in full flower in an unbroken chain as far as we could see. Wow, it was indeed a pleasant sight! Apparently, the folks around the place seemed highly industrious in vegetable farming.
Picturesque Markhu

After Chakhel, at Mahadevsthan, we took the right fork on the Pharping-Phakhel road towards Kulekhani. After pedaling down and up for an hour and a half, we arrived at Kalanki, a bunch of teashops perched on a hillside that sharply dropped to the Kulekhani dam and the enormous reservoir that stretched north as far as our eyes traveled–a breath-taking sight indeed. The road to our left dropped to the dam and the right headed towards Markhu. We stopped for tea, a little tidbit and a much-needed respite. It was already four in the afternoon. We soon left for Markhu, seven kilometers away. The Kulekhani reservoir kept us company all the way.
Markhu, a cluster of roadside shops and tea houses appeared quite busy. The landscape around, however, took a dramatic change. We suddenly found ourselves amidst tall, evergreen trees, with the hills around dotted with small houses and terraced fields that dropped to the man-made lake. A picture postcard setting, indeed! The reservoir at Markhu turned into a beautiful wide lake called the Indrasarovar.

The surrounding was so picturesque that we just could not help stopping, looking around and gazing at the big lake. Awesome! We could see a number of small rowing boats on the lake waters. A handful of restaurants and lodges marked the pleasant hillside.
Markhu is known for a local delicacy too— fresh fish from the reservoir. “People from Hetauda, Birgunj and as far away as Kathmandu, make frequent visits to savor the fish, boat the serene waters and relax,” informed one of the restaurant owners. A village elder told me that the suspension bridge across the Kulekhani river built by Chandra Shumsher, which people crossed while doing the ancient route, was submerged and almost 500 families were displaced when the dam and the reservoir (Kulekhani) was built in 1982-83. The entire villages on its course were inundated.
The bazaar area also boasted an old Victorian style building built by the Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher (1932-1945), which in the olden days served as a rest-house for Rana nobilities and foreign dignitaries traveling to Bhimphedi, the point from where they traveled to Birgunj in motor vehicles.
Then, it started pouring after we had pedaled hardly a kilometer up from Markhu. We had to stop and take shelter under the overhanging eaves of a house. After something like 45 minutes, the rain seemed to slacken. We put on our rain-jackets and resumed our ride. I was afraid that we would not be able to make it before dark to Chitlang because it was still like 7-8km to our destination. The ride got moderate with a few steep inclines thrown in. Phew!
My fears were not unfounded.
The shadows lengthened as the sun went down and darkness soon crept in as we sped past tiny settlements. Lights started appearing in the distance. We fixed the lights on our bike handles and continued on. It was pitch dark when we arrived at a fork: the left went to Toukhel and the right to Chitlang.
We saw a light, which appeared like a tea shop. “Hello, how far is the goat-cheese homestay at Chitlang from here, bhai (bro)?” I stopped to ask a young fellow. He looked at our bicycles and said, “at least two hours.” It was already seven and we were making very slow progress as the darkness was black as coal. The visibility was reduced to barely 10 feet, the bumpy road frequented by muddy pools and shallow trenches.
Destination at last

Saddle soreness is a horrible thing to happen to a biker but it does, no matter whom it is a pro or a beginner. A long time in the saddle causes the soreness and it sure hurts. Padded shorts specially made for mountain biking helps so does an application of Vaseline (petroleum jelly) to your perineum. We were pedaling in the saddle for almost 7 hours. We had our padded shorts on, applied a liberal quantity of Vaseline and often stood up on our bikes to give our butts a bit of a break and to restore blood flow. But it still hurt. Damn!
After something like one-and-a-half hours of pedaling in the pitch-black night across spooky dark shadows of wooded hills with no settlements or lights in sight, I was a little worried. I kept asking Shayeet if we took a wrong turn somewhere–there was no telling because it was just too dark and confusing. “No, I don’t think we ever came across a fork. We’re dead on the track,” he answered but sounded uncertain. Then, after doing a short downhill section, lights started appearing in the distance.
Our faces lit up, Chitlang, at last! It was already nine at night.
The streets were muddier along the deserted bazaar. We finally made it to the homestay at around 9.30pm after dodging potholes and deep ruts with heavy slush. Phew, we had done in excess of 120km that day! Since we had called the lodge earlier, we had no problem getting food and a room for the night. Deadbeat as we were, nothing could be more welcome than a hot meal and a cozy bed. We wasted no time and hit the sack after food.

Chisapani: Nepal’s untamed far west,"Friday, September 28, 2018","
I could not believe my eyes! It was a pure work of art! At Bunghat, the Karnali water had scoured the big boulders eroding them into an exquisite piece of sculpture–as if, an artist had taken great pains to carve them with his chisel and hammer. The fast flowing turquoise waters of Karnali and the resonant rumble provided a perfect backdrop to the aesthetic ambience of the place.
I had heard and read about Chisapani and its landmark bridge over the great Karnali River. When I finally made the journey to this far western region and got the opportunity to see the bridge for real, I literally gawked at the behemoth as it towered over me, a sheer bulk of concrete, steel, and cables (3,870 tons) dominating the skyline. The sight of the Karnali River making a dramatic entry through a steep rocky gorge, flowing down southward under the bridge was just awe-inspiring.
The single-pylon Chisapani cable-stayed bridge spanned the Karnali River, separating Bardiya and Kailali District on the East-West Mahendra Highway, 576km southwest of Kathmandu and some 90 km northwest of Nepalgunj. Completed in June 1993, it’s the only cable-stayed bridge in Nepal and considered one of the longest of its type in the world, 500 meters long, 10 meters wide and 125 meters high. The longest single-pylon bridge in the world is the Surgut Bridge over the Ob River in Siberia, Russia with a span of 2,070m.
Engineering marvel
An exceptional feat of engineering, every inch to the hilt! It took six years for Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan to build it leaving behind reminiscences of heroic efforts, great determination and punishing hard work put in by the engineers, contractors and construction crews against all odds and challenges. Those epic six years also took a heavy toll in mounting injuries and loss of a few lives.
Hitherto little known, Chisapani rose to prominence and trade after the bridge emerged, thus linking far western regions like Mahendranagar, Kanchanpur, Doti, Bajhang, Baitadi and many more. The local elders still remember the old days before the bridge came, when crossing the boisterous Karnali by boats and ferries was a perilous task, near impossible to venture during the monsoon spate.
Like all the far western regions, Chisapani was no more than a remote unknown settlement in the back of beyond surrounded by thick jungle before the east-west highway opened in the 1980s. The only access to this little town was to fly to Nepalgunj, and then either take a five/six-day elephant ride through the dense Bardiya forest or by foot along a jungle foot trail infested with all manner of wild animals and the dreaded killer malaria. Invariably, all the far western districts in those days could be reached from Kathmandu only by traveling via India.

It was my passion for fishing, which brought me to this little highway town in far-west Nepal way back in 2011. Translating to ‘cold waters’ the locals believed Chisapani was named after the cold waters of the snow-fed Karnali River. The small highway settlement was located on the western high banks of the Karnali, the longest (1,080km), probably the wildest and by far the most untamed river in Nepal. Seven tributaries including Mahakali, Seti (Budhi Ganga) and Bheri converge on the river Karnali.
After the chaotic, dusty, humid and squalid Nepalgunj, followed by vast expanses of farmland, the landscape dramatically changed after the highway entered the Bardia district. Soon, we were at the perimeters of the Bardiya National Park as the road cut through the dense forest. In the north, the diminutive Chure hills rolled along keeping us company as our truck sped on the highway. A friend from Nepalgunj had chosen to drive me to Chisapani in his pickup truck. It took some two and a half hours to arrive at our destination.
Highway town
Chisapani bazaar was located across the colossal bridge. To the east, beyond the bridge, forested hills stretched out as far as you could see. The imposing forest-clad Chure hills that rolled northward formed the northern border of Bardiya National Park. The due north offered an untamed landscape as the tall Chure ridges flanked the awesome Karnali, which cut through a deep gorge on its southward journey. The west was marked by the receding hills, stretches of farmland and the east-west highway. Southward, the river spread out into vast swathes of Terai floodplains and then disappeared from view behind the dense rainforests of Bardiya National Park.

Chisapani boasted of three things: the landmark bridge; the mighty Karnali River and the many roadside tea stalls that served fish. The source of river Karnali can be traced as far up as the Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar in western Tibet. Going by three different names: K’ong-ch’iao Ho in China, Karnali in Nepal, and Ghagra in India, it finally converges with the legendary Ganges. Its wild descent into Nepal after Tibet carries it through high canyons and deep gorges with many a V-grade rapids and drops on its southward journey joined in by feeder streams like the Seti in Doti and the Bheri in Surkhet Districts
Typical of most highway hubs, Chisapani’s main bazaar was a cluster of eateries that flanked the road sprawled out in a haphazard fashion. On one side, if ramshackle houses served as eateries and crummy lodges, the other side made for makeshift lean-tos where travelers bought tea, fruits and tidbits.
What struck us most at the market eateries was the row upon row of fresh as well as dried smoked fish hanging by the shop fronts. On arrival of a bus, I watched hordes of travelers heading for those eateries to try a platter or two of fried fish, the local delicacy. To me, it looked that Chisapani bazaar was doing a brisk business selling fish. Later, I came to learn that all that fish did not come from the Karnali River. Overfishing and rugged terrain had reduced the fishing in the Karnali waters to almost nil. The bulk of the fish came from the nearby village ponds commercially run by the local farmers.
The legendary Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora) in the Karnali River has fared the worst. Their numbers in the Karnali waters of Chisapani have dwindled disastrously. There was a time when even Gangetic dolphins could be sighted at Bunghat, north of Chisapani bazaar. Today, they have completely disappeared from the waters around Chisapani.
“Chisapani used to be a bustling town doing brisk business as it also happened to be a busy route to far west regions like Accham, Dailekh, Kalikot, and Jumla, but the town lost its prominence after the Kohalpur-Surkhet road was built.” Harkha Rawat, a resident of Chisapani, told me.
To the north of the town, a road headed north that ran all the way down the foothills of the Chure. Called the Tuki Bazaar, the place was flanked by rows of tin-roofed shanty houses most of which served as shops selling all kinds of wares from grocery to electronics. That road happened to be the old foot trail to the many hilly districts like Achham, Dailekh, and Jumla. The back of the houses seemed to function as living quarters. The bazaar thinned out as the road led to the foothills and the next village called Pitmari.

Pitmari afforded a stunning view of the river gorge where it cut its way south through the hills. A local guy told me that the gorge at the spot was famed for many a prize catches of the legendary Golden Mahseer fish in the past. I was at the river banks a few days ago casting for that great fish. At Bunghat, way down north of Pitmari, my eyes met a strange sight while working the river up and down at the rocky banks.
I could not believe my eyes! It was a pure work of art! At Bunghat the Karnali water had scoured the big boulders eroding them into an exquisite piece of sculpture–as if, an artist had taken great pains to carve them with his chisel and hammer. The fast flowing turquoise waters of Karnali and the resonant rumble provided a perfect backdrop to the aesthetic ambiance of the place.
Sparsely populated, Chisapani was inhabited by a heterogeneous class of Magars, Gurungs, Thakuris, Chhetris, Newars, and Brahmins. With cultivation on a modest scale, the local people live on trading, fishing, cattle-raising, piggery, labor work and doing odd jobs. Its residents also included quite a number of Indian Army recruits and pensioners.
Local legend
Every town or city is bounded by some kind of myths and history. Chisapani was no exception. Harkha Rawat related this local legend to me, which sounded interesting. “In the ancient times, he began, “the Jumli Raja (King of the old principality of Jumla) wed his daughter to a prince from a Terai state. Both the king and queen were, however, gravely concerned that their beloved daughter, brought up in a cold climate had to endure the windless, blistering heat of the Terai”.
The rest of the story went like this: After a deep consultation with the royal councilors and palace tantrics (shamans), the king ordered his shamans to trap an enormous quantity of wind into a gabu (a bamboo cylinder) to send as part of the dowry along with the groom’s royal entourage. That gift, they thought, would alleviate the scorching weather of the Terai. The king and the queen entreated the princess not to open the bamboo cylinder until she reached the prince’s home.
Fate, however, took a sharp turn and unable to contain her curiosity, the princess forced open the mysterious container at a place called Bunghat (north of Chisapani). The wind trapped in the cylinder suddenly escaped with such savage fury that it triggered a hurricane and turned the river into a raging torrent. The boats carrying the royal entourage capsized.
The prince was swept away by the raging Karnali and was bashed into a big boulder and died. The princess met the same fate after hitting a smaller boulder a little way downriver. These boulders eventually came to be known as the ‘Prince’ and the ‘Princess’. The Prince boulder can be seen at the south of the Karnali bridge, while the Princess boulder is a little farther downriver normally visible when the waters of the Karnali recede in wintry months.
Untamed wind
“Maybe there was some truth in that myth and that accounts for the high winds that reach gale force proportion in Chisapani,” said Harkha and smiled. “Interesting”, I said and smiled back. Harkha further told me that those winds last almost eight months a year. The winds are fiercest in December, January, and February, starting as early as nine in the morning and lasting until one in the afternoon, then resuming again after sunset.
The windy conditions lessen considerably during the monsoon months of July through September. The bridge is the worst hit as the wind gathers a huge momentum barreling down the narrow Karnali gorge. Even in late March, during my visit, my legs felt wobbly on the bridge because of the strong wind and I literally had to shout to be heard as the wind made a deafening sound. “Many a time, village women carrying loads of grass on their back are knocked flat when the winds are at their highest” a lady from Chisapani, told me.
The locals say that the monsoon rains bring respite to Chisapani from the notorious winds from July through September. For Chisapani, the winds, however, are a blessing in disguise since in its absence the place would turn into one of those humid and sweltering Terai settlements. Among other things, even in late March, I was surprised to find few mosquitoes in Chisapani; they stood no chance against the strong wind. In contrast, Nepalgunj swarmed with an army of them.

Chisapani is also well known among the travel trade circle as the ‘put-out’ point for rafting expeditions. Many travel outfitters mount seven to eight-day expeditions on the Karnali with class III to awesome class V rapids. The ‘put-in’ point happens to be at Dhungeswor, Surkhet. So, if you wish to arrive in Chisapani a little off the beaten track, try that eight/nine-day raft trip from Dhungeswor, if of course, you have the taste for a gut-wrenching, adrenalin-pumping spree doing a classic roller-coaster ride through narrow gorges and white water rapids on the churning water of the Karnali. Not for the faint-hearted though!
All things considered, Chisapani, the small town in Nepal’s ‘untamed far west’ as a travel destination can well fit into a fantastic itinerary. You can include a visit to the nearby Bardiya National Park at Thakurdwara in the package to further guarantee a rewarding bargain. Last but not least, if you happen to be a fishing enthusiast, angling for the elusive Golden Mahseer in the great Karnali can offer a thrilling adventure.

From cauliflowers to goat milk: The story of Nepal’s pioneering cheese factory,"Monday, September 3, 2018","One wintry morning, a couple in their mid-twenties prepare their load on their dokos (conical-shaped dry bamboo strip hand-woven baskets) laden almost to overflowing with cauliflower from their farm. The man carried a bigger basket and the woman a slightly smaller one. They heaved the load onto their backs and started from their home in Chitlang on the steep daunting climb to the Chandragiri ridge, the wooded hill still shrouded by the early morning fog.
That happened to be the ancient trail (before the Tribhuwan Highway came), which started from Thankot and traversed places such as Chitlang, Markhu, Kulekhani, Chisapani Gadi and finally the last point,  Bhainse, where the travellers took a ride in a lorry to Birgunj. The couple was on their way to Kalimati, Kathmandu (21-22km), to sell their produce. After a five hours gruelling walk with the heavy loads on the dirt trail (the present jeep track was not built then), they arrive at Panighat, Thankot and retire for the night there.
At first light next day, the couple head out for Kalimati to sell off their cauliflowers and return the long journey back home. Strange as it may sound, the man’s doko weighed a whopping 80 kilos while his wife’s, a mere 45kg woman then, (she weighs almost 80 kilos now) tipped the balance at 55 kilos! That couple happened to be none other than Ashok Kumar Singh Thakuri and his wife, Rita Singh Thakuri–the present owners of the goat-milk cheese factory at Chitlang, Makwanpur District. They were into vegetable farming in the late 1980s until early 1990s before going into cheese-making.

The story behind the goat-milk cheese factory in Chitlang, in fact, dates back more than 20 years, even before Ashok and Rita had the faintest idea about it. Sometime in the late 1990s, a French couple, Gerard Denis and Josette Denis, visited Nepal. They worked as agriculture teachers back in France. They came to spend their holidays in Nepal but after seeing the abject poverty in the rural areas, decided to help the village people mostly dependant on subsistence farming by introducing cheese-making from goat milk. The idea took shape and the French couple dedicated themselves to make it happen–a Herculean task indeed.

Subsequently, with the assistance from a French NGO based in Northern France, La Maison des Himalayas, a Dairy Goat Project (DGP) was initiated. The INGO was involved in Nepal to alleviate poverty in the rural areas of the country. The objectives of DGP were to develop goat breeding, production of goat milk and cheese-making. DGP was further helped by the Institut D’Hazebrouck, France–an agriculture school for dairy farming. The village selected for the project was Chitlang, Makawanpur district. The partnership was expanded: first with the DLS (Department of Livestock Service of the Ministry of Agriculture of Nepal) and then with Heifer International, France.
The fieldwork started in 2000 but it was only in 2004 the project got the new impetus after the French Embassy based at Kathmandu offered help to grant funds. In 2002 the factory building was built. As further assistance, French engineering students lent their hands to the project by visiting Chitlang from 2004 to 2007. It was now time for a local farmer to learn the process of cheese making. Among many aspirants, Ashok Singh Thakuri, a wiry little man was chosen as the candidate for his resolute personality and leadership qualities. In 2001 he visited the goat-milk cheese factory, La Cevriette, located at Pas-de-Calais, France for a month-long training. The training, however, lasted only 22 days and he was back home.

On November 22, 2004, Mr Michel Jolivet, the then French Ambassador to Nepal inaugurated the cheese factory and a trial production was made. It came through with flying colours. Initially, 25 farmers were involved in this project and the factory was run as a cooperative under Ashok Singh Thakuri’s leadership. Quite a number of women too were in the organisation. Each member was also given a goat as a gift by the French ambassador.
The modest production started with both soft and hard cheese. The main hurdle the factory faced was marketing. Star-hotels and posh restaurants in Kathmandu were approached but the response was lukewarm. Most of them were even sceptical about its authenticity. “Goat-milk cheese produced in Nepal, really? — was the kind of sarcastic comments I got from some hotel managers,” reminisces Ashok.
In Nepal goat is reared primarily for meat purpose and the milk from them is not marketed like cow or buffalo milk. So, the next problem the cooperative faced was the collection of milk sufficient enough to meet their requirement. The supply of goat milk all depended on increased milk production, for which an efficient breeding of goats was required. At the behest of Ashok, the French NGO again came to the rescue. French volunteers were sent to effectively market the cheese production and help improve the collection of goat milk.
More and more farmers were encouraged to rear goats and were trained to manage proper breeding. “I was shocked to watch the once arrogant hotel managers in Kathmandu completely change when I was accompanied by the French lady volunteer. They even promised to buy our cheese. The colour of skin made so much difference,” Ashok almost fumed indignantly.
In a year’s time, the state of the factory was far from satisfactory though. For three years, Ashok devoted himself to sustain the factory, which was already in a shaky condition. The cooperative was running into heavy losses because of poor market, insufficient goat milk collection, and lack of funds. Soon, it looked the project was teetering towards it last legs.
The cooperative members instead of coping with the problem and uniting to face the challenge and restore order started backing off. This came as a big shock to Ashok who had put in every ounce of his energy and effort to run the factory, the only in the entire country. It was his dream project. The non-cooperation from the cooperative members dashed his hopes. The co-operative went into liquidation and the production of cheese halted.
Ashok did not admit defeat, though. Despite all cards stacked against him, he was determined to pull this project through on his own. His wife, Rita, was equally resolute and the couple registered the factory in their name and struggled hard for three long years to sustain the factory and keep it alive. They had to start from scratch, a daunting task indeed. The couple started goat-breeding with a few heads and built an outhouse to rear them. They went from door to door around the village for the collection of goat milk and motivate the villagers to do goat farming.

Cheese making was Ashok’s forte but milk production and supply was equally important. He travelled to India and brought a cross-breed of Sannen goat (a Swiss breed recognized as the most productive domestic goat, which gives more milk than the local breed). He even applied to the government to import the pure breed from Switzerland but his request was turned down. A pure-breed Sannen produces 4 to 5 litres of milk daily while the cross-breed can produce one-half to two-half litres a day. Other breeds like the long flat droopy-eared Jamuna-pari (Indian strain), and Khari-bakhra (local strain) fare poorly and are less viable for obtaining optimal milk production.
It was an epic struggle for Ashok and Rita to revive the factory literally doomed to failure. They sold off some of their hard-earned lands and stabilized their financial condition. Gradually, they mobilised their marketing strategy, added more heads to their goat farm with cross-breeds, maintained better hygiene at the factory and devised a more efficient way of collecting milk from the local farmers. For the iron-willed couple, there was no turning back and no looking back. And surely after three years of hard work, it paid off. Eventually, Ashok and Rita’s dream was fulfilled–the factory survived.
“Today, the factory produces five to six kilos of soft cheese, which are easily sold in the market. In fact, if I were to produce 12 to 15 kg of cheese a day currently, marketing it would not be a problem,” Ashok confided to me confidently. The factory is running on its 12th year today. When Chitlang’s name is mentioned, the goat-milk cheese becomes a spontaneous issue. Every year the factory attracts foreign as well as domestic tourists. Colleges and schools from around Nepal, conduct study tours to the factory.
Both Rita and Ashok are quite content with their work at the factory. Ashok had the opportunity to visit a number of European countries such as France, Germany, and Belgium at the invitation of the goat-milk cheese factories from those countries. Recently, a Belgian team completed a documentary film on their factory at Chitlang.
Apart from the cheese factory, they also run a home-stay right next to the cheese factory. The objective of opening a home-stay was to cater for the many foreign volunteers and tourists (domestic included) who visited the cheese factory. His guests even included the Israeli Ambassador to Nepal. The idea caught on and they have expanded the accommodation to 12 beds after a humble start at the beginning with one room.
After the interview, my companion Sayeet and I  took a survey of the cheese factory and the goat farm. We had to take off our shoes, don a cap and change into a gown before entering the factory. As we surveyed the factory, Rita explained the cheese-making process in detail. The soft cheese sells for Rs.2, 500.00 per kilo and the hard for Rs. 3,500.00. The soft cheese can be stored in a refrigerator for two months, the hard cheese for two years.
“So, are you happy with the present status of your factory?”I asked after the visit to the factory.  “Yes, my husband and I are satisfied with the progress we have made in those 14 years. Our dreams have finally come true,” remarked Rita Singh Thakuri and gave me a demure smile. “You once weighed 45 kilos when doing vegetable farming. Now, you seemed to have doubled your weight. Is it the goat milk or the cheese that has made you put on so much weight?” I commented jokingly to Rita. Her grin suddenly broke into laughter.

In search for the ‘water tiger’ in eastern Nepal,"Friday, August 24, 2018","
Our team finally arrived at Mai Beni after a five hours hike. The last stretch included a stiff climb on a steep hill with a scary knife’s edge trail hardly a foot wide with Sun Koshi on one side and Arun to the other. In all honesty, with no head for heights, I literally crawled on all fours at places not daring to look down either left or right!
River god
Mai Beni is named after ‘Mai’, the goddess of the river, and ‘Beni’ translates to a confluence of two rivers. Normally, quiet and isolated throughout the year, villagers from near and far throng the riverside hill on the day of Magh Purne (the Full moon day of January) to offer puja (worship) to Mai Beni, which happens to be a small cluster of rocks. Other times, small groups congregate on the river banks to cremate their dead ones.
At Mai Beni, we were to stay at Dan Bahadur Rai’s (Beni Kanchha, to fellow villagers) place. Our bedroom was a shaky loft in his cattle shed. At the dead of night, we could clearly hear the deep rumble of the Sun Koshi which was only a spitting distance away. After a hearty meal, prepared by Beni Kancha’s wife, we retired early so that we could start our fishing with the first light of dawn. Gripped by nervous excitement, I had a fitful sleep, tossing and turning all night.
Angling begins
The next morning, we head to the Sunkoshi. Quiet with no soul around, the atmosphere was almost spooky. The forested hills across seemed to stand sentinel over the turquoise waters of the river. The water felt cool and appeared almost gin clear as I could see the gravel and stones three feet below the water surface.

We could hardly believe our luck as within two hours we bagged two golden mahseers. Upen had the first catch that weighed one and a half kilos followed by Bharatji’s, which tipped the hand scale at four kilos. The big mahseer put up a real fight before giving in.
A golden mahseer with its streamlined body and resplendent hues of olive green, silver, yellow and a golden tinge is a beautiful creature to look at—with a mouth that is astonishingly wide.
The atmosphere grew electric and everyone was grinning from ear to ear. After a photo shoot, it was time to release the catches back in the water where they belonged. It was an endearing moment as the big one slowly swam off with a wag of its tail as if it was bidding us farewell.
The next morning, we assaulted the confluence of the Sun Koshi and the Arun. While the Arun looked chalky because of snowmelt high up in the mountains, the Sun Koshi appeared greenish blue. The confluence presented us with our third catch, a golden mahseer again, just over one and a half kilos: courtesy of Prem. Prem did the honours of releasing the catch.
That morning, while casting my line, a strange sight met my eyes. I spotted two guys drifting speedily along out on the Sun Koshi standing upright on a makeshift raft made of bamboo culms lashed together.
They steered the bouncing raft with long bamboo poles.  Kanchha told us that they were ferrying the bamboos downstream to sell them at Tarai bazaar. Watching them ride standing up unsteadily on their flimsy raft gave me the shivers, as they had to deal with the intimidating rapids and massive boulders.
That evening Kanchha told us about a recent accident at Tribeni that had taken a man’s life. “The Koshi takes one or two rafters’ lives every other year,” he said.
Mixed bag
Day three and four were downers. Strong gusts, choppy water, and a dust storm followed by an unremitting drizzle made our angling impossible.
During our entire stay at Mai Beni, the Sun Koshi served as the source of our drinking water; we used Piyush (sterilizing solution) to make it safe for drinking. But for two days, our drinking water took on the colour of thin soup as the rains had turned the river murky.

Day five saw some excitement. Our catch included a goonch (catfish) weighing close to two kilos and the ever-lucky Prem bagged a katle (a copper mahseer, a distant cousin of golden mahseer). Both catches were kept back for the camp kitchen.
Day six saw feeble bites and a lot of misses. Then infirmity struck the camp. That night Kanchha’s daughter came down with a high fever, Prem developed gastritis, and Bharat was doubled over with an abdominal pain. But, not to worry—the marvellous Dharan boys had brought a mobile pharmacopoeia with them, and soon everyone was on the mend the next day.
On day seven Upen hooked another golden mahseer weighing a little less than four kilos, but we were a bit dubious about its release because of a slight tear at the lips. “Slight wounds or tears don’t matter,” our team skipper Bharat told us. “They heal up quickly, as the river water contains therapeutic properties,” he said.
We had to make sure the fish would survive after its release. After being tethered on a cotton rope in the water for an hour, the fish seemed to regain its strength and started darting around. So we let him go.
Day eight was a total bust. No fish. So, the following morning we set off to try our luck at the confluence of the Sun Koshi and a stream called Ekuwa, a two-hour walk from Mai Beni. Kanchha suggested taking a shortcut, which scared the living daylights out of me. We had to literally slither like rock climbers on a nearly vertical cliff groping for handholds while the Sun Koshi roared by in a deafening rage only a few feet below us.
Lightning strike
The incredible happened at Ekuwa!  Finally, I had a strike on my spoon! The rod was almost torn out of my hands and the reel jumped. With bated breath, I yanked my rod up, my Abu 7000 reel screeched as a couple of yards of 30-pound breaking-strain line spun out.
Then all of a sudden the line went slack. Dammit, I had lost it—just like that! My tough luck! My expert co-mates checked the drag on my reel and figured that the fish must have been over 10 kilos. I stamped my feet hard and swore like anything!

Luck, as it seemed, eluded me all the time for everyone had made a catch so far but for me. Down in the dumps, that night, I nursed my bruised ego with a few extra glasses of kodo ko rakshi (local millet alcohol).
On day 10 we bid Kanchha and his beaming family good-bye and headed back for Dharan. At Baraha Chhetra, we learned that there was a bandh called by the Maoists, so no vehicles plied on the road to Dharan. We decided to stay the night over at Chatara Ghat and take a ride the next morning to Dharan ending our fishing trip to our great relief that we were spared the dreaded Maoist confrontation throughout the tour.
Shortly after my return home to Kathmandu, my Dharan friends on their next trip to Mai Beni met with two incredible sights. At Chatara bazaar, a Gudi (the Gudis are fishermen who live a nomadic life on the banks of the Sapta Koshi at Chatara Ghat) was selling his day’s catch: 12 kilos in all, out of which almost nine kilos were golden mahseer fingerlings. For my fisher friends that was an appalling sight.
But, as if to compensate for this ghastly sight, the next day at the confluence of the Coca and the Sapta Koshi, my friends spotted golden mahseer fingerlings darting around by the thousands in a pool. That was reassuring news. It showed that there was still a glimmer of hope for these great fish.

I visited Mai Beni for three more years to relive the adventure and continue my little study of this legendary game-fish extending my exploits deeper into the mighty Sapta Koshi and the mysterious Tammar.  The catches, however, got less and less every year.
My fisher friends from Dharan, however, kept up their good work. To save and conserve these species, they still practice ‘catch-n-release’ to this day and untiringly keep trying to bring awareness among the fishing community of the Koshi. Kudos to those unsung heroes!
What is heartening to observe is that more and more Nepali fishers have joined hands to conserve this ‘flagship species’, the Mighty Mahseer--the real tigers of the water. This great species is, however, begging for proper cognizance and attention its terrestrial cousins, the Royal Bengal Tigers, are getting. Tight lines!

Sikkim’s Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve braids nature with culture as tourism expands,"Wednesday, August 22, 2018","

Popular among trekking and hiking enthusiasts, the Khangchendzonga National Park(KNP) in Sikkim is the starting point for several stunning trails, taking explorers up and through a dizzying variety of forests and terrains to sites offering breathtaking views of Mt. Khangchendzonga, the world’s third highest peak.
But KNP, unlike other national parks, is rather special. The park represents a protected core area ensconced within the massive Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (KBR), in the eastern Himalayas. The park not only offers a glimpse of the astounding biodiversity, from rare orchids to the endangered red panda, it also showcases how nature and human beings thrive side by side in harmony.
This syncretism of religion, culture and environment protection, is a testament to the reverence of the indigenous communities, for their “guardian deity” Mt. Khangchendzonga.
While the landscape has engendered the communities’ cultural identity (rocks, peak or lakes are invoked in rituals), their traditional knowledge has shaped and influenced conservation so much so that in one instance, the people’s opposition to two hydropower projects on the “holy river” Rathong Chu, on religious and environmental grounds, led to the scrapping of the projects.
This 1784 square km high-altitude park is, in fact, so important, both ecologically and culturally, that in 2016 it was recognised for its tangible as well as intangible heritage as a UNESCO Mixed Heritage Site, the first such site in India designated both for cultural and natural significance.
Now, two years on, the biosphere reserve, bordering Nepal to the west and Tibet (China) on the north, has been brought under UNESCO’s World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), bringing cheers to the state of Sikkim, already feted for its conservation, ecotourism and organic farming policies.
Welcoming the development, conservationists, scientists and locals believe the renewed attention will help put in place measures to address gaps in conservation, development and livelihood challenges including setting upper limits for tourists to the core area and reducing pressure on natural resources in transition zones.
Tashi Wangdi, director and member secretary, Indian National MAB Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said the new designation broadens the possibility of engaging and co-operating with biosphere reserves in the MAB network internationally in order to look at conservation and development in a holistic manner.
“In the biosphere reserve, we have core, buffer and transition zones. The KNP is the core area in the KBR. It is a legal identity and under the Wildlife Protection Act. But the buffer and transition zones go hundreds of kilometres beyond the core area and that is where the challenge lies,” Wangdi told Mongabay-India.
As per UNESCO, the buffer zone adjoins the core area and is used for activities compatible with sound ecological practices that can reinforce scientific research, monitoring, training and education.
The transition area is the part of the reserve where the greatest activity is allowed, fostering economic and human development that is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable.
About 35,000 people, mainly from the Lepcha, Bhutia, Nepalese and Limboo communities inhabit 44 villages in the areas surrounding the park.
“We have to work on how we can ease the pressure on the forest and natural resources and how we can improve the socio-economic status of the people in the area. They rely on the forest and natural resources for their livelihood so one area of work is extending alternative livelihood options so that pressure on natural resources can be minimised,” Wangdi said.
This apart, the WNBR widens the scope for better engagement of concerned ministry departments for troubleshooting as well for facilitating funds and resources for conservation work.
“In addition to that, we give importance to research and development activities so that we can find out gap areas in conservation, in development and in livelihood so they can be addressed,” Wangdi said.
Hemant K. Badola, advisor (biodiversity) in the office of Sikkim’s Chief Minister Pawan Chamling said the state is giving high priority to the conservation of landscape and importance to culture dissemination among masses.
“To regulate and monitor growing tourism over ecologically sensitive Himalayan zones and fragile terrains is a tough task. The organic landscape of Sikkim fascinates tourists. The Sikkim policies on tourism and ecotourism are clear manifestations on necessary measures, taking strong community participation,” Badola, told Mongabay-India.
Badola, the lead author of the UNESCO MAB nomination document of KBR stressed that the new inscription means the Sikkim government policies on promotion of ecotourism, organic farming and socio-economic development in the transition zone of KBR has proved “highly beneficial.”
The former scientist-in-charge of the G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment & Sustainable Development (Sikkim) said it is also vital to understand that organic farming in the transition zone of KBR has a great bearing upon enrichment of biodiversity in the area, said Badola,
“Worldwide, various scientific studies suggest the organic management in cropping help augmenting species richness and improved biodiversity. Over the years, pieces of evidence emerged that the organic farming in the transition zone of KBR has resulted in increasing soil fertility, better water absorption and abundance of pollinators, that helped vivid enhancement of biodiversity elements, both floral and faunal,” Badola added.

Occupying nearly 40 per cent of the state, this biosphere reserve is one of the highest ecosystems in the world. Within an area of 2931 square km, the landscape slopes up from 1,220 to 8,586 metres.
Located in the Himalaya global biodiversity hotspot, KNP/KBR complex’s rugged and ancient terrain carpeted by old-growth forests draws birding and wildlife enthusiasts, pilgrims, rock climbers and star-gazers among others.
At Yuksom, a tranquil hamlet close to the entry of the KNP, friendly hosts, unhurried lifestyle and warm, inviting homestays that complete the rustic experience with traditional food are not only ensuring a sustainable livelihood for the locals but also enabling them to protect and manage forests in accordance to the state’s ecotourism policy. Yuksom is the first capital of Sikkim.
Considered a pioneer in ecotourism in India, Yuksom-based NGO Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC), registered with the Sikkim government, helps locals run and manage homestays and also monitor impacts.
KCC has been assiduously monitoring the influx of trekkers and the items and waste they bring into the national park.
On their exit from the park, each item brought back is checked against those listed upon entry. If the items brought back are fewer than the ones taken in (implying littering inside the protected area) they are fined. Similarly, unauthorised extraction of medicinal plants and specimens including butterflies and moths is a strict no-no.
Locals opined more patrolling and monitoring staff is needed. In fact, the KNP management plan discusses the shortage of trained staff to “protect some valuable medicinal plants of the park from illegal collectors and regular patrolling to check the cattle grazing within the park.”
Of late, the organisation’s Pema G. Bhutia revealed, travel companies bringing in a large number of tourists at one go has become a cause for concern. He emphasised the importance of estimating the park’s carrying capacity: the number of people inside the park at one time.
“One aspect we are looking at is exploitation of the national park by some travel companies. We have certain travel companies who are promoting mass tourism bringing 40 to 50 people in one go. Following the UNESCO tag for the KNP we had hoped there would be studies and regulations in place regarding carrying capacity of the area. We hope that with the renewed focus, some steps can be taken,” Bhutia told Mongabay-India.
B.S. Siktel, the director of KBR agrees. “Poaching is no longer a major issue and biopiracy has diminished but tourism has gone up. We do not know the carrying capacity and no studies have been undertaken so far,” Siktel told Mongabay-India. “The landscape is a heaven for trekkers and pilgrims and ecotourism is a key moneymaker for the indigenous communities. While we recognise the importance of tourism, we also are aware of the pressures that mass tourism brings.”
Siktel pointed to the park’s management plan (2008-2018) that mentions the perils of unregulated tourism including damages to vegetation and change in the behavioural pattern of wild animals in general.
“Unregulated garbage dumping, un-designated camping sites and use of local timber wood for cooking pose a threat to the bio-resources of the park.”
Data provided by KCC shows the KNP received 457 tour groups and 289 international groups in 2012 while the numbers dropped to 150 (India) and 181 (international) in 2015 following the Nepal earthquake. The year 2016 witnessed an uptick to 261 (India) and 186 (international).
But numbers are just one side of the coin.
One of the key tenets of ecotourism practised at Yuksom is the interaction between hosts and guests. According to Uden from KCC, this interaction (a casual chat over a bonfire, or on a jungle trek) is aimed to apprise visitors of the importance of the landscape and culture. The more they learn, the fewer chances there are for any inadvertent harm to the place.
But many private hoteliers and fly-by-night operators disregard the education part of the deal.
“So guests do not learn to value the landscape. Moreover, the benefits from ecotourism do not come to the community,” Uden said. “ Our model of ecotourism relies on travellers viewing the landscape with respect and this attitude triggers positive actions such as not disposing of any waste in the trek. This helps us in conservation.”
To drive home the point on awareness, KCC’s Bhutia cites the example of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, popularly called the “toy train”, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
“The kind of joy and pride that one experiences while riding the Darjeeling toy train, similar pride and joy should be felt by visitors to KNP/KBR landscape. Instead of thinking that one is travelling to one of those national parks, they should feel the difference in understanding that KNP is special. We need to work hard and create awareness in this regard,” Bhutia stressed.
Diminishing use of Lepcha, Bhutia and Nepali languages, the changing character of traditional villages and questions about the cultural appropriateness of tourist-town “nightlife” are listed in the management plan as some of the apprehensions regarding impacts of tourism.
As per the plan: “At the heart of all these concerns is a perceived loss of Lepcha, Bhutia and Nepali identity in the own homeland and a wish to maintain styles of tourism that are appropriate to the national park and cultural context.”

"In eastern Nepal, a quest for the ‘water tiger’","Wednesday, August 8, 2018","
The golden mahseer of the Himalayan Rivers, with its streamlined body and resplendent hues of olive green, silver, and yellow with a golden tinge, is a beautiful creature to behold, and a formidable challenge to bag.
This little adventure of mine meant a lot to me because it successfully motivated a group of veteran anglers from Dharan to set a record for the first ever mahseer catch-and-release among their fishing fraternity in the waters of the Sun Koshi, Tamor and Arun rivers in eastern Nepal.
In March 2005,  I decided to go on an angling tour of eastern Nepal’s Sapta Koshi river in quest of the legendary Himalayan fresh-water game fish, the golden mahseer (tor putitora), commonly called the pahenle sahar in Nepali. Jim Corbett called it the fish of ‘my dreams’ and went on to christen it ‘the tiger of the water’. Skene Dhu, a prominent writer named it the ‘Mighty Mahseer’.
The time for my reckless wandering into a godforsaken hostile territory was not right as the length and breadth of the country was hard hit by Maoist insurgency. Friends and family members called my single-mindedness nothing but ‘sheer lunacy’.  Perhaps, they sounded right but call it madness or call it destiny, that’s what drives anglers in pursuit of this most coveted quarry, the undisputed king of the Himalayan rivers.
After a 45 minute flight to Biratnagar, it took an hour on a taxi to get to Dharan, a well-planned and remarkably clean city and former recruitment center for the Brigade of Gurkhas. Soon, I was shaking hands with my fisher friends: Bharat Sunuwar, Tek Bahadur Limbu, Upendra Limbu and Prem Gurung. I knew I was in capable hands for the seasoned veterans, with more than 15 years of their angling in the Sun Koshi and the Tamor (a tributary of Sapta Koshi), knew these waters like the back of their hands. The trip would not have been possible without them.
Mai Beni
Our final destination was Mai Beni, some 35km south of Dharan, a remote hillside slope that jutted out to the confluence of the snow-fed rivers, the Sun Koshi (locals also called it Dudh Koshi) and the Arun.

We made the first leg of the journey from Dharan to  Baraha Chhetra (a Hindu shrine) on the roof of a battered Land Rover (we couldn’t get seats)—leftovers from Dharan’s British Gurkha days. Can you imagine, these jeeps were good enough for 15/16 people, shuttle 40-odd commuters at a time crammed in like gundruk— a type of local spinach tamped down into an earthen pot, set out to ferment, then sundried and served as a popular curry.

Phew, the hour-long ride on the heavily rutted treacherous hill track in the rickety old jeep with sheer drops to the raging Sapta Koshi below happened to be one of the most hair-raising experiences of my life!
Our first layover was Baraha Chhetra, a small pilgrimage town lined up with tea houses, shops, living quarters and a dharmashala (rest house for the pilgrims). A stone paved path led to the famous Baraha temple, a Hindu god Vishnu in the manifestation of a pig. Hugging a wooded hillside, the temple looked onto the mighty Sapta Koshi, a stone’s throw away.
Our much-awaited angling began that evening. After the clammy day under the hot March sun, the light breeze that came off the river felt fresh and invigorating. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I stood before the magnificent Sapta Koshi, the largest river system in the country, which stretched out in all its glory, awesome and dignified, the water a soothing turquoise hue. The swirling depths, the sound of lapping waves against the gentle rumble of the river, the cool waft of air, the smell of Koshi water, and the lush wooded hills around made my already breezy and sparkling spirits running riot.
Total bliss!
Excited? Of course, I was for the prospect of fishing these legendary waters for the first time was just too overwhelming. I was the most euphoric of the group, anticipation and awe running at fever pitch. Devotees offered prayers and took holy dips at a nearby confluence where a small feeder stream called Coca met the Koshi.  Forested hills towered on the other side of the river. A suspension bridge over the Coca hung across the northern skyline, connecting two districts, Sunsari and Dhankuta.  Our angling that evening proved unsuccessful though and we retired for the day.
A stepping stone
We had company at the river bank the next morning—local fishermen. And while we fished using metal lures, they used flour paste for bait. We followed an anxious cast-and-retrieve routine, almost like the rhythmic ticking of a clock, over and over again, eager for a bite. The locals, however, followed a simpler more relaxed routine—simply stand-and-cast then wait with the patience of Solomon.
After something like two hours of working the riverbank up and down, our efforts paid off.  Prem landed a beautiful golden mahseer weighing nearly two kilos. The flurry of excitement was joined in by the local fishermen too. After a brief photo shoot and an exchange of pleasantries, we released the catch.
Even before I started this journey, I had a new sense of purpose all set in my mind–to release all the mahseer catches we made. I was rather dubious about the whole idea though for nothing of that sort had ever been done before by my fisher friends in their 15 years of angling. It would indeed be a Herculean task, I realised. To my great relief and delight, my wonderful friends agreed on the catch-and-release when I explained in length the steady decline in the golden mahseer population over the years and its threatened status.
I had no idea then that it would prove as a stepping stone in all future releases of mahseer catches made by my Dharan friends–to this day! Surprisingly, Prem, the most opposed to the idea turned out to be the first to admit openly that it was more fun and sporting releasing the catch, rather than keeping it back for eating.
The Dharan friends even went on to help me raise some awareness among the riverside community on the alarming phase that particular species was going through and the dire need to conserve them.
Bad vibe

We had no idea that the news about the Catch-n-release had already spread like bushfire—apparently picking bad vibes.
Eyebrows were raised and fingers pointed at us when we walked by the bazaar. For the locals, releasing a hooked fish was unimaginable and unacceptable–nothing less than a cultural shock. No sane person in their community would ever do a thing like that.
It did, however, help me rub shoulders with the locals, who listened curiously to what I had to say.  I particularly shed light on the popular but unethical methods like blast fishing, poisoning, electro-fishing, fishing during the spawning season and rampant gill-netting. Gorey, a senior local fisherman, who happened to drop by the tea house, although deeply skeptical, was my eager audience.
I began, “Gorey bhai, I’m here not to mislead you or trying to persuade you to release your catches, because I know that’s your bread and butter. All I want to say is that there’s an urgent need to save the golden mahseer from being destroyed by unethical means, if we’re to enjoy harvesting it year after year.

It’s time we preserved it for posterity, so that our children and grandchildren, too, can reap the rewards.”
“Secondly, the fishing must stop during the breeding time. A spawning female mahseer”, I explained, “lays eggs in batches of nearly 25,000 eggs per kilo of body weight.”
“So a golden mahseer weighing 10 kilos lays some 225,000 eggs,” I went on.
“Unfortunately, mahseer eggs and fries have a high mortality rate for they undergo rough waters and harsh conditions,” I explained.
“If, say, only 25% of them survive and make it to adulthood, what will we have the next season:  56,250 to be exact, plus the spawning mother, right? But, if we kill the breeding female we will lose all 56,251. No?”
I did my best to get the startling facts across, hoping that Gorey understood the facts, the issues and the consequences. And though he looked confused and overwhelmed by the figures at times he made it a point to nod vigorously.
Boundless Koshi
Our hike to Mai Beni began the next morning, each guy lugging a backpack weighing no less than 10 kilos. Prem’s weighed a whopping 30 kilos. Besides, a few pieces of clothing and our fishing gear, most parts of the load was taken up by food supplies, including enough rice and dal (lentils) for the entire trip and pots and pans to cook it. For a city slicker like me, it felt like venturing into the “world’s last great wilderness!”
The trail followed the contours of the boundless Sapta Koshi all along. I stopped occasionally to gaze silently down in awe at the great expanse of water that transformed itself into deep pools followed by raging whitewater rapids. Rocks and huge boulders, some the size of a truck, lay piled up against the river banks.
The trail cut across rugged terrain with no sign of habitation until we arrived at Ghumti Khola, the proposed site for a hydroelectric dam, then a small settlement called Tribenighat. A closely knit village at the confluence of the Sun Koshi and the Tammar river, the latter spanned by a suspension bridge.
After Tribeni, the river downstream takes on the name of Sapta Koshi, a merger of seven rivers, namely Sun Koshi, Indrawati, Tama Koshi, Likhu, Dudh Koshi, Arun, and Tamor and flows south to the plains of nearby India and ultimately the Ganges or the holy Ganga.

Tribeni is also known as Majhini Ghat named after a lady from a Majhi (fishermen) ethnic group; ghat translates to a river bank or a cremation ground for the Hindus. As the local legend goes, this lady used to ferry travelers across the Tammar River in her dugout canoe long before the present bridge was erected.
The locals also say that she once ferried late King Mahendra( Late King Birendra’s father) across the river. Unaware of the stranger’s identity, the Majhini insisted that before she’d take him across he must help her carry some firewood up from the river bank. By all accounts, the king did so, with pleasure.
These areas of Nepal’s eastern lower hills are inhabited mostly by ethnic Rais, especially of the Bantawa and Chamling clans, who live by fishing, raising goats, chickens and selling bamboos by ferrying them down the Sun Koshi, but grow very few crops.
Rice is an extreme rarity in those parts and corn serves as both the staple crop and the daily meals for the locals.  We had to survive on dhindo (cooked corn flour dough) after our stock of rice and dal (lentils) we back-packed along ran out.  We stopped briefly for tea and a little snack at Tribeni, and then continued on.
Our next village stop was Shimle, which boasted of an imposing suspension bridge over the river Arun, which divided Bhojpur from Dhankuta district.

"Nepali women’s bid to use international carbon money to rejuvenate land, water and economy","Sunday, July 29, 2018","
The ‘gold mine’ is ready, but what about connecting the community to the market?
Ratanpur in western Nepal’s Tanahun District could be any other village in the country. Here, you neither hear children crackle nor young men sing songs to their beloved, all you hear is the aches and pains of old age. The cuckoo bird is the loudest living soul in the village, but her songs are also drowned when the floodgates of the sky open during the monsoon.
Looking at historic paddy terraces, one can only imagine how lively this place would have been in its heyday. Young men and women would work in the fields and their tunes would reverberate in the surrounding hills. But all that is now a distant dream for Ram Kumari Pandit (60s) and her fellow villagers.
“You don’t find young men here. All of them have left,” says Pandit, “Our sons have migrated abroad to look for jobs. Their wives have left the village in search of a brighter future for their children in cities,” she shares. “They do not see a future for their children in the village, and have migrated to cities such as Kathmandu and Pokhara.”
Ram Kumari is one of the thousands of senior citizens who are now in-charge in villages across the country. Just like the young men and women of Ratanpur, more than 1,500 Nepalis, most of them young men, leave the country every day in search of work, and an equal number, if not more, move from the villages to the cities.
The shortage of able-bodied men and women in their prime has had a devastating effect on rural households. The numbers speak for themselves: more than 21 per cent of arable land in the country remained fallow last year, Nepal was ranked 81st in the Global Food Security Index.
However, in Ratanpur, the terraces tell a different tale. The village, located around 200 km west of Kathmandu, is where local women have taken up a seemingly impossible mission—to make it profitable for villagers to stay at home rather than go outside seeking for opportunities. Their modus operandi: utilise money from private carbon emitters in Europe to rejuvenate barren land and breathe life into the village once again.
It all started in 2015, the year the earthquake caught Nepal unprepared. With rumours of the possibility of an epidemic in Kathmandu, people from outside the Valley returned to their villages to stay there until the situation normalised. This was the time windows that had been shut for ages opened again to let in sunlight and let out the fragrance of freshly-cooked dal bhat (rice and lentils).
“Everyone was in a reflective mood,” remembers Hans Peter Schmidt, a Swiss scientist who accompanied his friend and forestry scholar Bishnu Hari Pandit to the village in the aftermath of the disaster. The villagers saw what had become of their ancestral land and wanted to do something about it. Many ideas were discussed.
Bishnu Hari explained to the villagers that the barren farms were problematic in many ways. “I told them that when we leave the rice fields fallow, we are not only abandoning our ancestral heritage but also leaving it prone to erosion,” he shares. All this is happening as effects of climate change are already being felt in the hills.
“It was there that the villagers announced that they wanted to plant 50,000 trees in the next three years,” says Schmidt, who along with Bishnu Hari was given the responsibility to come with a programme to turn that dream into a reality. Schmidt and Bishnu Hari, who had been working on implementing ‘biochar’ projects (charcoal produced from plant matter)) around the country for the past few years, came up with an idea.

They identified the main challenge. The government did supply a limited number of saplings for free, but their survival rate was pretty low. Local communities wanted to plant trees, but did do not have the money to buy them, let alone maintain them. The money had to come from somewhere. Schmidt’s idea was to get money from private individuals in Europe who want to offset their daily emissions.
Schmidt and his team members from Ithaka Institute, a scientific organisation based in Switzerland and Nepal, decided that under the scheme, private emitters will be charged $35 for every ton of carbon offset by trees in Ratanpur. This would cover all costs to setup the forest gardens and their maintenance for three years. The farmers would receive money for taking care of their trees. Schmidt says that Ithaka calculated the price of carbon by looking at the overall cost of the project and resources needed to sustain it. “The price of carbon is not the same around the world.”


Under the scheme, environment-conscious people like Sibylle Maurer-Wohlatz who lives in Germany pay a certain subscription fee to offset their personal carbon footprint. “I spend as much money as is needed to compensate my personal emissions by letting trees in Nepal grow. Trees are as long as they grow a medium to store carbon. This is a sum of 27 Euro each month,” she tells Onlinekhabar.


“Because I am still causing CO2 emissions with my way of life, I wanted to compensate in a way that really works. Because the richer countries profit worldwide from the resources of the poorer countries, I was very pleased, when Hans Peter Schmidt told me about his project and the intentions to let people compensate their emissions by giving money to plant trees in devastated areas in Nepal to give small farmers the chance, to stabilise the environment; the earth and to improve their agricultural conditions.”
According to Ithaka, a total of Rs 2.15 million has been spent on the project so far. The 218 farmer families have received Rs 285,000 as carbon money for the 50,000 trees they have planted so far. A total of Rs 1.4 million, received as carbon money, was used to procure plants, establish a nursery and buy pipes and plastic for the project. The initiative has also helped farmers build water retention pits. The plantation activities were also supported by DFO and Hariyo ban programme, along with UK Aid.
All planted trees are GIS inventoried—the trees GPS coordinates are recorded and fed into a software–and their yearly biomass carbon uptake would be calculated on the base of the average ten-year carbon accumulation.
They also recommended cinnamon, mulberry, michelia champaca and paulownia trees—plants that have high commercial value. The money would only be a catalyst. After three years, the income from tree crops (fruits, nuts, medicine, essential oil, silk, perfume, honey, timber, animal fodder) would be by far more than the carbon money.

But it was the local women who took the lead to kickstart the project. “The local mothers’ group vowed to make the project a success,” remembers Hari Maya Pandit, one of the members. “We realised that keeping the land fallow was a big mistake,” says Ram Kumari Pandit, who is now the chair of the group.
“We started a campaign to plant trees, and we dedicated ourselves to making it a success,” says Ram Kumari Pandit. “In the beginning, people were hesitant to switch from paddy, which they had been growing for centuries, to trees. But soon everyone realised why trees were important,” she shares. Survival rates, which were around 57 per cent in the first year, have gone up to 86 per cent—thanks to the active participation of women, the use of ‘biochar’ and the formation of ‘triade’ groups.
Hans Peter Schmidt and Bishnu Hari Pandit had been testing the use of biochar with different crops around Nepal. They had seen that biochar not only helped increase survival rates of crops, but also helped retain carbon (that would have otherwise found its way into the atmosphere in the soil).
As Ratanpur had also been affected by Eupatorium adenophorum the ‘forest killer’ (an invasive shrub), using it to make biochar had dual benefits. Similarly, charging the biochar, which would remain in the soil for a long time, with cow urine, boosted the amount of nutrients plants would receive from the soil.
Although the use of biochar could push the survival rate to 57 per cent, it was the ‘triade’ system that would take it past the 80 per cent mark. Under the triade system, each farmer is made a member of a group of three people who help one another in the farm.

Between 2015 and 2018, a total 218 farmer families in and around Ratanpur planted more than 50,000 trees of multiple species on 50 ha of private land. “We were very excited to prepare biochar, plant the trees and see them grow,” says Surya Kala Gharti. “The whole environment of the village has changed in the last three years,” she adds. “I think these many trees would not have been planted were it not for the mothers’ group,” claims Ram Kumari Pandit. “After the implementation of the project, local water sources, which had dried up, are also coming back to life as the soil retains more moisture.
According to Ithaka, the 50,000 garden trees sequester a minimum of 800 tonnes of carbon per year, It is enough to offset the carbon footprint of 70 Germans or 2,800 Nepalis.
Later this year, the whole campaign will reach its third year and farmers who have received ‘maintenance’ money for their surviving trees will stop doing so. But are the farmers ready for the switch as Schmidt had imagined in 2015?
The answer seems to be a yes and a no. Ram Kumari Pandit says a lot of people visit her village these days. “There are times when visitors from different forestry colleges come here to observe what is going on. Some international scholars also come here to spend time,” shares Gharti, who is a member of the local municipal assembly.
The women in the village are already earning money, even before the products from the forest gardens are sold in the market. There is a steady stream of people who come to visit the village and pay local house owners money for the shelter. “This was something unexpected for a village like Ratanpur,” says Ram Kumari Pandit. A few months ago, the women’s group received Rs 210,000 for hosting a group of tourists in their homes.
However, this was not the economic benefit Schmidt had imagined. “We do not know what is to be done with our product. But we are sure that Schmidt and Bishnu Hari Pandit would have thought something about it,” says Gharti.
Schmidt says he wants to create a model in Ratanpur that could be easily replicated in villages in Nepal’s hills. He says that cinnamon oil is in high demand in Europe and he could link up the farmers with interested companies in Europe. But he wants the local products to be consumed locally, that seems to be a big challenge as the women seem to have little idea about processing their raw produce and marketing them outside the village.
The Swiss scientist says Ithaka is working on establishing a distillery to prepare cinnamon oil and it will also help local farmers produce silk, but doing that will also take time. However, large swathes of land in the village in no longer fallow, and that in itself is a big achievement.
“What we want to show is that people in the villages can earn more than people in the cities because production takes place in the villages and cities only consume. This could be the reason, one day, people return to their villages,” he adds. “This is not a development aid project but the creation of a pilot project for climate farming where we try to create and develop an environmental, economic and social model that could be multiplied in many regions of the country and abroad. The main income will be generated through the forest garden products”:
“The carbon payment is only a kind of seed money to allow the implementation of the new agronomic systems.”
The project comes at a time when Nepal is preparing to take advantage of the much-talked-about REDD-Plus arrangement, under which developing countries are to receive money from developed countries for management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
“REDD-Plus adopts a similar model to what has been done in Ratanpur,” says Mohan Poudel, a REDD expert. “The other advantage of projects like this is that they reduce the pressure on community forests and encourage private enterprise based on forest products. This is something REDD wants to achieve,” adds Poudel.
“The other positive is that this model has shown that when people have monetary incentive to grow trees on barren land, the survival rates go up. This is something that the government needs to take note as land is being left barren in the hills due to outward migration.”
However, Poudel is a bit skeptical that the model could be replicated at a large scale as there are legal hurdles to doing so. The constitution has placed carbon trading under the ambit of the federal government, and that complicates the matter.
Meanwhile, Ram Kumari Pandit, who still maintains her kitchen garden to get her daily veggies, is happy. She is not waiting for the economic benefits to come to her. “I did not even participate in the campaign for the money. I just wanted our ancestral land to be preserved for posterity and that is what is happening here. If my grandchildren want to return, they will have the option to do that.”

Upper Mustang: Dangerous roads lead to beautiful places,"Tuesday, July 17, 2018","
The most dangerous roads lead to the most beautiful of places. That is exactly what I felt while going to the forbidden kingdom of upper Mustang. With every mile I passed through the rugged terrain, I couldn’t help but feel that I was a part of an adventurous game–a game I could win by crossing the finish line and lose by parting with my life.
As I looked below, the narrow road sent a shiver down my spine and the tall hills above on which winding snake-like roads nonchalantly crisscrossed made my heart pound every time we approached a narrow bend. Fear crept in and faded away throughout the journey. But that did not stop me from wanting stop in front of the small streams and waterfalls we passed by. Our track ahead felt like it had been paved by a bolt of lightning.
But as I was there to enjoy a part of Nepal I hadn’t visited, I suppressed my fear and decided to take it all in. As soon as I stopped being afraid, I felt that this part of the land was indeed one of Nepal’s true gems, a place that hasn’t been marketed enough.

Upper Mustang is a place that is rich in both natural beauty and history. I was so elated by its beauty that a part of me didn’t want to leave.
Due to its remoteness and the absence of natural resources, upper Mustang remained in the shadow until 1992 when it was first opened for tourism. As soon as tourists started coming to this place, It developed at a brisk pace and its cultural and economic landscape evolved.

The ‘timeless place’ that somehow escaped the wrath of development was a place where the peoples still nurtured a close relationship with the land. It still is a place that is both pristine and primitive, and thus beautiful. Upper Mustang has been overly mystified in one too many travel journals.
This area didn’t have roads before 1992, and if you look at the paths closely, they aren’t actually roads. That these tracks do exist nowadays is a great thing because over these years the area has seen a rise in domestic tourism–something the people of the place hadn’t dreamed of in the mid-90s.

Parts of the road that leads to upper Mustang aren’t the best, for example, the stretch between Chusang, Samar and Bhenka Danda is in a miserable state.
Roads from Jomson take you up to the China border in Korala but they aren’t the best as construction works are continuously going on. The most dangerous part of the trip was crossing the Kali Gandaki River, which during the monsoon isn’t the easiest thing to do. But a bridge is being built here too.

Locals are hopeful that when the the roads get better, more tourists will come. “We have been taking around 2-3 groups of domestic tourists to upper Mustang. But due to the condition of the roads, most people are very afraid to get here,” adds Mahendra Gurung who runs a tourism business in the region.
He further mentions that the place is ideal for those who love adventure because these roads aren’t for the faint-hearted.

“For tourism to get better in the region, the Korala border should be opened,” adds Gurung who feels that other things will take care of themselves after that.
What I feel missing in the region is adequate information. The information available isn’t enough and tourists won’t know the importance of the place. There are a lot of monuments around the region which have both cultural and historical significance but without proper information, no one will know about them. There are some who don’t even the reach the place.

I think that the local government should enroll tourist police who are well versed about the place and who can inform both domestic and foreign tourists about the landmarks.
Upper Mustang is one of the best-kept secrets of the Himalayas. One that hasn’t had many travellers. Although the region has attracted adventurers from all over the world, there’s still plenty of mystery left.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/upper-mustang-most-dangerous-roads-do-lead-to-the-most-beautiful-of-places.html,travel
Photographing the elusive snow leopard in the high Himalayas,"Wednesday, July 4, 2018","For trekkers on the Annapurna circuit trail, the village of Manang is where the road ends and the trails up to the high mountains begin. Far from the paths walked by well over one hundred thousand people per year, Tashi Ghale, a Manang-based photographer turned field biologist, is busy deploying and collecting camera traps at high-elevation; trying to document and understand one of the world’s most elusive predators – the snow leopard.
As stealth hunters, snow leopards have tremendous camouflage that makes documenting their presence a challenge and the vastness of their barren alpine territory only adds to the difficulty. Yet, capturing images of these high-mountain predators has become one of Ghale’s specialties. After over a decade of field biology work, Ghale was recognized with the 2016 National Conservation Award from the WWF in recognition of his contribution to wildlife conservation.

Mongabay-India, in collaboration with thethirdpole.net, sat down with Ghale in the backyard of his guesthouse in Manang to learn what started him on his path as a field biologist as well as what motivates him to climb up again and again to the frigid abode of the snow leopard.
What motivates you to do this challenging job as a field biologist in the high Himalayas and why is it important?
Some people do yoga to rejuvenate themselves, others listen to music, read books or play games but I go to the mountains for such refreshment. The mountains are my yoga.  The day you can collect images or videos and then watch on your laptop you feel like you are in heaven. This March, I brought down the SD card from the mountains and opened the video and found a snow leopard and her cubs playing for three hours on camera. It was wonderful!
These observations generate new facts and evidence that also add value to the scientific community. Many people don’t know that snow leopards also eat fruits such as juniper berries or the roots of ephedra plant. When these new things are revealed through pictures and videos from camera traps then it’s easy to communicate how these animals survive and what’s their population status.
When scientists go about digging out new knowledge from these camera trap images, I feel so happy I am able to contribute. I also engage myself to bring awareness to the new generation.  We [the Snow Leopard Conservancy] also take local students out to the field and teach them how to install camera traps, talk to them about why they are important, and also tell them why we need to take care of wildlife. We also do essay competitions, paintings competitions in schools.
I do it because I think if even a small percentage of those trained eventually work on conservation that would make a huge difference. We need to bring more people who care about this planet on board. These children in schools and the youth in colleges need to learn more about these species. It is us who have put these wild animals in danger and we have to be more responsible and act in any ways possible to protect them. They have value on this planet.
What led you to choose this profession of wildlife research in the mountains?
It all started with a training provided by wildlife experts in 2004 that changed my life in this direction. In 2004, I participated in a training [camp] for nature guides led by Darla Hillard, Snow Leopards Conservancy’s education director and wife of the pioneering snow leopard researcher Rodney Jackson.
I was always fascinated with photography and that was my business from the 1990s. This place [the Annapurna Conservation Area] is awesome for photos since it has really beautiful landscapes. In 2005, they [the Snow Leopard Conservancy] came again and trained me on how to install camera traps to help survey the local snow leopard population. I hadn’t even finished with my schooling, but the training provided me with a basic knowledge on snow leopards and what kind of habitat they prefer.
In 2006, they sent me few camera traps and I was the one who installed them.  Now, my primary focus is on snow leopards. At the beginning the mission was to take at least one picture of a snow leopard. But when you succeed, your hunger grows to get into next level on your path. I wanted to get more pictures like a group of snow leopards, couples or even family. My photo-hunting mission became a passion that took me deep into the mountains to the home of wildlife, which have been roaming there for ages.
Could you please explain how you work to install camera traps?
For the first few years, I was more like a camera traps installer than a field biologist. At first, it [camera placement] wasn’t that systematic; it was a bit more ad hoc. But over time we learned about the qualities of the machine as well the science about snow leopards and their habitats.
We identify places that snow leopards potentially would prefer and install our cameras there.  Normally, snow leopards prefer places like ridges, rocky outcrops and ravines. We also search for physical signs like their markings or scat (faeces) and visit areas where there has been high human-snow leopard conflict. We talk to the herders who frequently visit those places. The most sighted locations are typically well-suited habitats, so we take that into account for the camera placement. After a few weeks we go back and collect the cameras and smile if the snow leopard had showed up. If not, we wish ourselves better luck next time.
In 2016, we started using a grid system for camera placement, with each grid cell comprised of 5 square kilometres. In this area, there are 26 grids and in each we install two camera traps – one for still image and another for video but in the opposite direction so that both parts of their bodies can be captured. Once we install we return home and go again for data collection after a few weeks.  That’s how the regular data collection work gets done.
But we have only been able to cover 13 grids now. It takes weeks to do even one. We have two stations, which are at 5300 metres and 5400 metres. Those are the most difficult ones as the area gets buried under snow for months.
How do you feel to be a citizen scientist and how is it to work with people who have formal academic degrees that you don’t have? Do you feel like you could have done better if you had formal education?
I didn’t even complete my school education so being a wildlife field biologist was beyond my imagination. But as I moved deeper, I understood wildlife better.  The hardest part now is that I don’t have capacity to analyse the data that we collect from the camera traps. I am deeply involved in fieldwork but I can’t do data analysis as that demands a special capacity, which I lack. However, it’s a group effort. I enjoy my work and feel blessed to work for wildlife.
Which is the happiest and saddest moment for you when it comes to your research work?
Sometimes you’re just lucky. In 2014, I was at 4,200 metres to install cameras for trapping snow leopards. I took one extra camera trap with me and installed it as well. Later on, when I collected the extra camera I found images of something else.
It turned out to be a Pallas cat that was thought to be extinct in the Himalaya. Long back in 1776, German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas first found it in Central Asia so it was named the after him. There was no Nepali name for Pallas cat so researchers named it Tashi Biralo (Tashi is good luck in Tibetan language and Biralo is cat in Nepali).  I am honoured and lucky to have the cat named for me.
Of course, there are sad moments too. So far, we’ve lost three camera traps. When you have walked for days and invested weeks planning one installation, you pray for the safety of these devices when you are walking back home. After few weeks you go to the trap location and you don’t find cameras you feel like you lost the world. It’s so painful. There is no use of these cameras for ordinary people but some people steal them, don’t know why?
Another problem is the inaccessibility of the snow leopard habitats. In November 2017, we installed two cameras at 5,300 and 5,400 m and the places were snow covered thereafter. I tried to get those cameras in March but couldn’t do it. Maybe the memory card is already full and batteries are depleted. Mountains are a hard place to work, given the rough terrain and steep slopes. It demands a lot of commitment and patience
What needs to be done to protect high-mountain wildlife?
Protecting these endangered species is challenging but important work. For example, the snow leopards are the apex predators, which mean they eat prey like the Himalayan blue sheep, which depend on grasses for food. Even in the high mountains, there is a food chain where all species play key roles. If the [the snow leopard population] is not maintained it is a signal of an ecological imbalance. Future generations should be able to see these beautiful species, so we have to keep them protected.
The most important thing is to value these species. We should understand their value first. Then, if we would like to protect them we need to have a deeper knowledge of their behaviour and the threats they face.  This is possible through scientific research. With more knowledge about snow leopards, we have a better understanding of their needs and then we can act accordingly to help them survive.

Why Nepal’s tourism industry needs more affordable hostels than expensive hotels,"Tuesday, July 3, 2018","James Walker visits Nepal for a month every few years to take a break from his hectic life in the United States. He always prefers to stay in Thamel because it was where he first stayed back in the 80s. But two years ago, everything changed when he decided to walk to Swayambhu rather than take a cab.
“I always took a cab there but that day I don’t know what happened I wanted to walk and then is when I discovered all these different hostels around the Paknajol area,” says Walker, who adds he was shocked to see so many tourist hostels in the area.
Over the last few years, there has be a rise is these hostels in the area which have been a revelation for backpackers. “Most come here on a tight budget. Not all come here to have a fun. Some come here as an escape from their daily life,” adds Walker, saying he stays at a hostel named Zostel every time he visits Kathmandu these days.
Staying in a hostel will save you huge amounts of money, but the main reason people stay in hostels isn’t the price, it’s the people. The social atmosphere in hostels is totally unique, and it’s what makes ‘hostelling’ so addictive. It can transform one’s trip from a sightseeing tour into a more meaningful experience.
It’s a place where one can meet new friends from all over the world. You’ll cook together, drink together, and go on adventures together.
One of the prime reasons these hostels have gained popularity is they are cheap. Any hotels around Thamel will at least charge tourists $10 for a night which is double the price of many hostels in the area.
Most of these hostels have bunk beds like those found in Amsterdam and are safe and secure. Some even have private rooms for those who want their privacy. They offer services like kitchen, laundry and a few also have travel desk which makes the tourists feel at home.
“One of the reasons hostels have been successful is also the rise of backpackers in Nepal,” adds Dhurba Raj Sapkota, Manager of Wander Thirst Hostels. “Thamel has become really expensive for tourists. With many hotels not giving attention to details, it has resulted in tourists not going there,” he continues.
“The fact that we offer many services for a reduced price makes us value for money. Like, during off seasons, we always give tourists a complimentary service including breakfasts and dinners which adds some value to our service,” adds Sapkota.
It is quite true. Over the last decade, Thamel has become really expensive for both Nepalis and tourists alike. Nepal has been marketed as a cheap destination but if one looks around Thamel, it isn’t so cheap. Plus, the price one pays for the rooms doesn’t match the quality–a reason why most backpackers prefer to pay $3-$5 and stay at a hostel than pay $10 and stay at a hotel.
“The first time I stayed at Shantipur, it only cost me $4 and that included breakfast,” adds Walker who says he was quite shocked at the price they were charging. But soon, he found better options around Thamel.
Hostels have also helped solo travellers find people to go trekking with. Many come to Nepal in groups but there are a few who come alone and that is where these hostels help them out because there are many fellow travellers like them.
“I came here in April to trek around the Annapurnas and was wondering where to stay. A friend of mine had stayed at Zostel, and he had recommended me to stay there. I thought I’d find people in Pokhara with whom I could trek but to my surprise, I met many here at Zostel itself which was quite nice,” adds Tom Miller, who feels hostels are necessary for tourism to flourish.
“If you can’t bring backpackers, you won’t have many tourists. If you look at it if the hippies (who were backpackers) didn’t come to Nepal, tourism in Nepal would never have flourished the way it has since the 80s.”
Some travel agents emphasise bringing highend tourists to Nepal, but that is quite ludicrous because the same agents talk about bringing two million tourists to Nepal. The numbers are quite high and unless Nepal welcomes more backpackers, there is no chance of reaching that mystical number.
If these businesses survive or not one will have to see; but many have got good reviews on websites like Hostelworld and Tripadvisor, platforms from where guests come to these places.  But there are a few who need to do more than reducing the price to get guests.
It is likely that these businesses will flourish over the next decade with the Nepal Tourism Board hoping to bring 5 million tourists a year by 2030. With the rise of more international airports, the inflow of tourists is sure to rise, which will give these businesses added motivation to prove themselves.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-nepals-tourism-industry-needs-more-affordable-hostels-than-expensive-hotels.html,travel
Journey to Everest: This is how supplies for climbers are transported to the base camp,"Thursday, June 14, 2018","Every year hundreds of people climb Mount Everest from Nepal in May. Apart from chartered helicopters, there are no means of transport up to the base camp, where trekkers start the gruelling climb up the highest mountain in the world. The nearest regular commercial flights land at Lukla in Solukhumbhu district of northeastern Nepal – about 65 kilometres from base camp. All the climbers’ equipment and belongings have to be carried this distance by yaks, mules or porters.

Legendary climber’s Nepali protégé wants to fulfil Swiss Machine’s dream,"Monday, June 4, 2018","
On May 24, Tejni Sherpa, 27, summited Mount Everest for the fourth time as he and alpine photographer Johnathan Griffith became the last people to summit the highest peak of the world this spring season.
Unlike his previous three accents of the world’s highest mountain, this would be a completely different experience. This time, he wasn’t guiding anyone to the top of the mountain–in contrast to other Sherpas, he was climbing for himself.
Before heading to Everest, Tenji said he would be dedicating this climb to his mentor and climbing partner Ueli Steck who tragically lost his life around Camp II last year, and that’s what he exactly did.
Tenji’s initial plan was to attempt what Ueli had planned – climb Everest and then climb all the way to Lhotse and do it without supplemental oxygen, something that has never been done before.
“I wanted this to be a tribute to Ueli. Both me and John (Johnathan) wanted to do it for him. And I’m glad we could do it,” adds Tenji who says he’s gutted that they couldn’t do the Lhotse Traverse due to bad weather conditions.
“We were shooting which is why John said we should go last so it would be easy to get the shots we desired,” he adds. But as they left it late, the weather, which had stayed good for most times this season, started to get worse which meant his plan of climbing Everest without supplemented oxygen had to be put on hold.
“I had planned to do it without oxygen but the weather got really bad and then I had to use it. When you’re that high, you can’t put your life at risk,” adds Tenji, who said he learnt a lot from his mentor Ueli.
Born in a small village in Gudel, Solokhumbu, he spent most of his childhood playing around the hills of his village. “Like all children in the hilly areas, I too had to go walk two hours to get to school,” adds Tenji who says that walking to school every day helped him develop climbing skills.
That climbing skill was polished when he met Ueli on Everest in 2012 when he became Ueli’s Sherpa as the ‘Swiss Machine’ summited Everest. “It was amazing to climb Everest with Ueli. He taught me a lot of things,” says Tenji, adding that he owes a lot to Ueli.
After the Everest summit in 2012, the two climbed the difficult North Face of Cholatse and Tenji became the first Nepali to climb the mountain. “That was one of my most difficult climbs. It was technical and it was just the two of us which made it an amazing experience. Don’t think I’d have been able to climb without him,” he adds.
Ueli had seen a spark in Tenji or maybe Tenji reminded Ueli of his early days, a reason why Ueli took him to the Alps to train and mentor him. “He motivated me a lot and taught me a lot about climbing a mountain in his (alpine) style,” he adds.
In the Alps, Tenji learned how to climb without ropes or oxygen. There he learned the techniques of how alpinists climb and the techniques they use to tackle the highest peaks.
All that training was to prepare Tenji for something big – climb Everest from the never repeated West Ridge which had only been done once by Tom Hornbein in 1963. But last year, while acclimatising Ueli tragically passed and the project was put on hold until John had the plan to do it this year.
“John and I discussed a lot about doing the West Ridge but we decided to skip the risk and difficulty of Everest’s West Ridge and climb Everest and Lhotse using the normal routes,” he adds.
But as the weather got bad they couldn’t do Lhotse. “I’m still a bit sad for not being able to do Lhotse. It was a great opportunity to do what Ueli always wanted to do, but luck did not favour us,” he adds.
Tenji is relatively young as compared to other Sherpas around Everest, but he certainly has earned a lot of plaudits from his peers in the region. Working with arguably the greatest alpinist of all time and being a Sherpa, he has learned a lot about mountaineering.
But this one project still haunts him–a reason why he says he tried to do it again. “Of course I want to do it. There is nothing more I want to do. This is not for me but for Ueli to whom I owe a lot. And if everything goes as plan I will do that my friend, mentor and brother wanted to do.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tejni-sherpa-this-young-nepali-climber-wants-to-conquer-everest-via-never-repeated-route.html,travel
Steve Plain: From a hospital bed to shattering mountaineering world record,"Thursday, May 31, 2018","
Three years ago, sleeping on his hospital bed with a halo brace on, Steve Plain decided to go on the most adventurous challenge of his life. For many people who would have occupied the bed before him, this might have been getting back on their feet and resuming their daily lives, but not for Plain.
He wanted to do something that would put his name in the record books, and climbing the world’s seven summits – the highest mountain in each of the seven continents within four months would surely put him there.
After three and a half years of hard work, he completed the feat on May 14, 2018, completing the challenge in 117 days.
“It has been a long four months,” recalls Steve, who says the only thing he is looking forward to is meeting his family and sleeping in own bed. “I miss my bed the most and I look forward to sleeping on it,” he shares.
But when asked about his record-breaking feat, Steve is lost for words. “After all that I’ve been through I think it all ended very quickly. But, having said that, I think it has been a life-changing experience for me,” he adds.
Steve started his journey 11 months after his injury. “I had to get back on my feet. The doctors told me it would take me a year to walk, but I took that as a challenge and climbed my first mountain in New Zealand,” adds Steve, who had no mountaineering experience prior to his injury.
By 2016, he had climbed Mt Aspiring in New Zealand, Mt Chopicalqui in Peru and Mt Lhotse in Nepal in a bid to get ready for the ‘seven in four’ challenge. “If I look back, these mountains were very important. It gave me a general idea of preparing myself for the challenge,” he adds.
His plan was simple; start the project at Antarctica around January and end it by conquering Mt Everest in May.
The first mountain he headed out to conquer was Vinson in Antarctica. “I was raring to go. It was the first mountain and I was really excited about the entire journey that was about to start,” he adds.
“Vinson was pretty easy. It was a bit cold, but the weather gods were kind to us. I really couldn’t believe I was in Antarctica,” he adds.
As soon as he summited his first peak, the clock started ticking on the project. He had less than four months to climb six more mountains, which is why he left Antarctica as soon as the weather cleared, and headed towards Argentina (South America) to scale up Mt Aconcagua (6962m).
“Getting away from -30 C and going to +30 was a really fun experience,” he says, adding “It almost felt like Australia.”
Soon that feeling disappeared as he headed to Aconcagua National Park to take on the highest point on earth outside of the Himalayas.
“There weren’t many rest days, I wanted to get each mountain done as fast as I could,” he says.
In Argentina, he was joined by a veteran mountain guide, Jon Gupta, who would become his climbing partner for all the remaining climbs.
“Jon’s help has been immense. I don’t think I would have been able to do it without his help and guidance,” adds Steve.
With Jon, Steve started his trek towards Aconcagua Base Camp passing through spectacular valleys. “I loved the place. The views from the Camp 1 at Aconcagua is simply breathtaking. But, it was quite odd as Camp was nearly high as Vinson, which I had climbed a week ago,” he adds.
After a few days of acclimatising to the new weather, they walked to the summit. After climbing for six hours in cold weather from camp 2, they reached the summit as Steve ticked another mountain off his list.
“It was great. The views were magnificent, especially the sunrise we saw on our way up,” he adds.
As soon as they scaled the mountain, the duo returned to the base camp and enjoyed a lovely BBQ. “That was a good day, but I think we had too much wine,” Steve chuckles.
Then, he left for Mendoza from where he would be going to Tanzania (Africa) to take on Mt Kilimanjaro. “It would have been fun to spend some time there. But as we were short on time, we had to go.”
However, the trip did not go according to the plan as Steve and Jon got stranded in Chile and had to spend a night in the back of their pickup truck. “That was quite frustrating. That happens when you do not do your research well. Having said that, the view around was amazing, so can’t really complain,” says Steve.
The next morning they reach Laguna Verde in Chile. “I don’t have words to describe that place. It was so quiet, so remote and the best part is that the lake had a hot thermal pool, which was really cool.”
The time in the hot spring was ideal before going to the top of the highest volcanic mountain in the world, Mt Ojos Del Salado. “When you are there, why not climb it. And, it would also be a practice for Mt Kilimanjaro,” adds Steve who states it was fun climbing Ojos Del Salado.
Soon after Jon and Steve summited Ojos Del Salado, they left for Tanzania. “Getting there from Argentina was quite an adventure. There are no direct flights so I had to go to New York, London and Istanbul to reach Tanzania.”
After 50 hours, Steve finally reached his destination for the third peak – Mt Kilimanjaro.
“Unlike most mountains which are part of a great range, Mt Kilimanjaro rises out of the surrounding planes, standing impressively all by herself. Maybe that is what makes the mountain special,” he adds.
They reached the summit of Kilimanjaro in just three days of arrival. “The weather was lovely and if I look back, I think it was the easiest climb and the fact that we had the summit to ourselves was itself an amazing experience.”
After completing Mt Kilimanjaro on February 14, Steve set off to climb Carstensz Pyramid in Papua New Guinea (Australasia). This was an entirely different challenge as both Steve and Jon hadn’t climbed this.
Steve and Jon left West Papua on a chopper to go Yellow Valley (Carstensz Pyramid Base Camp).
“It was an anxious few days wait. A group were stuck on the mountain due to bad weather and they were thinking of closing the mountain for a brief period of time. But, we got lucky. As the weather cleared, we were on our way to Mountain Number Four,” he adds.
After reaching Yellow Valley, Steve planned to get to the top as soon as possible as he didn’t trust the weather around the region. “It was really a different experience climbing Carstensz Pyramid. It was different than other mountains. Not a lot of snow, but very technical to climb,” adds Steve.
Even Jon seems to have enjoyed climbing Carstensz Pyramid. This experienced mountain guide says that the climb was exciting and a different experience to other mountains which he had climbed over the years. “It is all uphill and more like a rock climb than mountaineering,” says Jon.
“The Tyrolean crossing near the summit might have been the hardest part of the mountain. We crossed that and the summit was right there,” says Steve.
On February 21, Steve completed Mountain Number Four and was just three mountains away from a seven summit world record.
To make sure there were no issues, Steve later climbed the highest point in Australia on March 3. “It was pretty special as I got to climb Australia’s highest point with my brother,” adds Steve who after that set off to go to Russia to conquer mountain number five, Mt Elbrus.
“As I’d just been to Australia during the summer, Russian winter was quite cold. But it had to be done, and we began acclimatising which wasn’t as easy due to the soft snow around the region,” he recalls. After a few days acclimatising, Steve summited Mt Elbrus in Russia (Europe) on March 13.
“It was amazing. To be on top of Europe during the winter was quite an experience. It was really cold and the final 1800 m vertical accent was really tough even though we’d just been to Carstensz Pyramid.”
With two months to go, there were only two mountains left – Everest and Denali. There was no chance scaling Mt Everest before April. So, Steve headed to Alaska in the United States (North America) to take on Mountain Number six, Denali.
Denali is a relatively easy summit in the summer, but as Steve had left Everest for last he had to summit Denali before mid-April.
“Our summit of Denali was not easy. It was cold and a self-supported expedition. It was only four of us on the mountain, which meant we had to carry our own loads up the mountain. It was not an easy task,” says Steve.
It wouldn’t be easy to move the load up the mountain and they had little to no progress pulling the sledges up the mountain, which Steve says was a bit frustrating as they even fell into a few knee deep crevasses along the way.
Every day they gradually got up at a slow pace. Thanks to the deep snow, they reached up to 3500 m; 1500 m short of the summit.
“When I think back, it was quite fortunate to have such a good team with me. If not for Chris, Rob and Jon, I do not think our Denali summit would have succeeded,” says Steve.
But, as they gradually got up the mountain, the weather started to change and things started to look bleak. “It wasn’t fun waiting in our tents for the weather to clear. And, with temperatures dropping below -40 degree C , it was quite a hard few days waiting to the summit,” he adds.
Their first week was quite nice but the second was anything but attainable. The winds were blowing vigorously and the entire project looked in doubt. At the end of the second week, they got a 24-hour window when the winds would calm down. That is when Steve decided to go for it.
“I was scared because we were going to be summiting during the night that made the project equally challenging. That is why after we reached the summit at 10:00 pm, I felt relief like no others as now there was only one mountain between me and the record.”
After spending few days at the mountain, Steve and Jon left for Nepal (Asia) to tackle their final hurdle – Mt Everest.
Steve reached Kathmandu on April 11, which gave him enough time to get to Mt Everest Base Camp early and acclimatise.
“I reached Lukla on April 15 and trekked towards the base camp. I even met Reinhold Messner on my way to Tengboche. He was there to shoot a documentary of some sort,” adds Steve.
Most of the climbers had already reached the base camp by then. Steve reminisced his struggled to find his camp. “There were too many people around the area. Nonetheless, we soon found Tim Mosdale whom I had met while climbing Mt Ama Dablam with Jon  in 2016.”
During the climbing season, all groups have their own setup. Some are elaborated and some are basic. The one Steve was staying in was not as elaborated as others but was good enough, according to Steve.
At the base camp, Steve did everything to keep himself fit including climbing the Kala Patthar six times. “That was fun. I used to walk around a lot. There was not much to do apart from waiting and keeping yourself fit,” he adds.
Gradually, the acclimatisation process started as climbers started to arrive. Jon and Steve made a few visits to Camp 1 and back. After a week at the base camp, both of them along with their Sherpa, Pemba, headed towards Camp 1.
As the rope fixing teams laid down ropes, the three of them climbed with them giving a head start to most of the climbers around.
“Acclimatising did get easier gradually. There were times when I used to come back to base camp from camp 1 and even visit Dingboche where my family came to visit me. It was good to see my sisters and father before I set to climb the highest mountain in the world,” adds Steve.
The waiting game was strong for everyone at Everest this season as everyone waited for the weather to get better. In order to kill time and make the most of their time there, Steve and Jon attempted to climb Nuptse.
“Nuptse is a tough peak and I thought it would be a perfect practice run for Everest. But we know it would be tough at Nupste as it had not been summited for the last five years. The reason I was not hell bent of scaling it,” he adds.
They nearly did summit Mt Nupste while falling around 200 m short of the summit as they did not want to risk an avalanche.
“I was quite disheartened after returning from so close but I didn’t want to lose focus on my main goal. So it was all right, I guess,” he says.
Three weeks moving from base camp to camp 1/camp 2 and back was quite tiring for Steve–not physically, but mentally. When you are doing your last mountain, one does get a bit restless. The weather started getting better after three weeks and things started to move at a good pace.

“We started going up camps just behind the Sherpas who were fixing the ropes. If I look back, the fourth week was when it all started to go as per the plan. I had around two weeks to complete the record. As we moved to camp 3, I had the summit within touching distance because the Sherpas had just reached the summit fixing ropes.”
On May 14, Steve completed his mission to climb seven summits within four months, and he did it with a few days to spare.
“It was an unbelievable moment. I was short of words. It was a very satisfying moment. I could not have done it without support from family and Jon,” he adds.
After the summit, Steve, Jon and their Sherpa came back to camp 4 from where Steve and Jon got the idea of summiting Lhotse.
“We had not planned it earlier, but as we were there and had the permit, we thought why not? Hence, we set off the next day to complete what they call the high double,” he says adding that this was the most memorable climb of his project.
“The pressure was off, and I enjoyed it so much. With that summit, I knew it was time to get back,” he continues.
Steve does feel that he will miss the mountains. “It has been a large part of my life and I will definitely miss it. Especially, the people around the mountain without whom this whole project would never have been a success.”
After a few days in Lukla, while waiting for flights to get back, he finally got a helicopter back to Kathmandu. He was overwhelmed to get a small reception by the local media.
“It was good to be back in Kathmandu and get to sleep in a comfortable bed. I just wanted to go home now,” he says adding, “It has been a long four months for me travelling across the globe, but for now, I am looking forward to being back in Perth and relax for a brief period of time.”

An ambassador’s journey to Nepal’s mountains,"Wednesday, May 30, 2018","
French Ambassador Yves Carmona, who came to Nepal in 2015, embarked on a journey to Langtang recently.
One thing that is common between the people France and Nepal is that they both love mountains. Both countries are blessed with gorgeous mountain ranges which have a special place in the hearts of not just the local people, but also in that of people around the world.
The Himalayas and Nepal have a special relationship with the French. The first-ever 8,000m expedition was carried out by a Frenchman, Maurice Herzog, when his team successfully summited Annapurna I, three years ahead of the Hillary and Norgay’s expedition to Everest. Herzog then went on to write a best-selling book on his Annapurna expedition called Annapurna Premier 8,000. The book was read by many French children who admired the mountains, and one of them was the Ambassador of France to Nepal, Yves Carmona.
“The French people have a special place in their heart for the Himalayas,” says the Ambassador who in an earlier interview with Onlinekhabar said that the people of France think that the Himalayas are part of their own culture.

“They believe that the Himalayas are the heritage of humankind,” he had said.
For that reason, during his time in Nepal, Carmona made it a point to observe the lifestyle of the locals as well as the diverse culture of the country.
Recently he visited the Langtang region with a group of French tourists. “I had never been to Langtang but had heard a lot about it beautiful landscape, which is why I decided to go there,” says Carmona, adding he also wanted to check how the travel agencies were treating their guests.
Over the past year, the arrival of French tourists in Nepal has regained momentum after a sharp decline following the deadly earthquake of 2015.
The Ambassador was also there to assess the damage caused by the earthquake in the region. “The old village of Langtang had been completely destroyed,” he adds, continuing, “It was terrifying to take that into account when we are on the spot.”

However, he adds that it was encouraging to see the tenacity of the people and the reconstruction progress happening around the region.
Ambassador Carmona trekked all the way to Kanjin Ri, the highest point most trekkers reach on the Langtang Trek. Kyanjin Ri is a small hill by Himalayan standards that sits just to the northeast of Kyanjin Gumba (3830 m). “The views were amazing from 4,400 m. You could see fantastic views of the upper Langtang Valley and surrounding peaks and glaciers,” he adds.

As Carmona trekked with a group of 11 French tourists, he was bound to have a bit of fun. “The most memorable part of the trip was the party we had on the last day. We were joined by the Sherpas and the porters who had accompanied us during our trek and we had a feast where we sang and danced and the ambience was very amicable.
As his term as Ambassador to Nepal comes to an end soon, he is making the most of this time and is visiting as many places as he can.

But he shares that he doesn’t have a specific bucket list. “Well, in Nepal, one can never have a defined list; actually my list is never ending but if I had to choose, I would love to come back to Nepal and do the Annapurna Circuit Trek and visit the Bardiya National Park.”
“I also want to go Ilam,” he is quick to add.
When asked if he ever wanted to summit a mountain, in an earlier interview he said, “I do not plan to reach the top of the mountain. I would, however, want to reach Base Camp.”

Tremors of laughter reverberate in quake-ravaged Nepali village,"Wednesday, May 9, 2018","Two months after the Gorkha earthquake, I was looking at the remains of Naule Biswakarma’s house. Wheat grains buried in the rubble had sprouted. Cracks streaked across the walls like rivers in a physical map. Rainwater had seeped into the walls, creating blotches of chocolate brown on the tawny surface. The writing on the wall was that the walls would soon melt back into the mud. A mottled toad had moved in, lured by the increased dampness of the floors.
Months before the earthquake, old age and poor health had restricted Biswakarma to the bed. The quake brought down his house on him, turning his bed into his deathbed. He was the only person to be killed by the earthquake in and around Nepane, Gorkha.
Two hours later I was in the verandah of a local school teacher’s house, listening to Bi Maya recount her life’s story, asking her to speak a little louder so that the tape recorder would catch her voice over the patter of rain on the tin roof. Bi Maya was Naule Biswakarma’s daughter. Suffering could have claimed her as its own.
Bi Maya’s husband had died years ago, leaving her to raise five children, all sons. She had been living with her father ever since her mother’s death. And then the earthquake took her father and their house. She also lost the land on which their house had stood. The land and the house had belonged to her mother’s father. Now that her father was dead, her mother’s brothers had claimed it.
Almost all of the 140,000 rupees the government had given her as compensation for her father’s death Bi Maya had spent to buy a tiny piece of land. The rest she used to repay loans. She was living in a tarp-roofed shack that she and two of her sons, one fourteen, the other thirteen, had rigged. To feed her family she took other people’s cattle out to graze, cut and carried grass weeded and hoed and planted, sometimes all of these in a day, day in day out. Her daily wage for this was a hundred rupees.
As I got ready to leave after the interview, which she had related with frequent giggles and one sigh (“Two of my sons didn’t even call after the earthquake.”), a look of motherly worry supplanted her sheepish smile when she came to know that I didn’t have an umbrella. Sir lai dukkha hune bhayo!
Day after day, interview after interview, over and over again, I heard stories whose recurrent themes were loss, hardship and uncertainty. The people I talked to were deep in debt. They had lost their houses. Their sons did not even call home from Dubai or Malaysia or Qatar, the same sons they had sent to those places by taking loans that were way beyond their means. Some of them wanted to come home to help, but they couldn’t afford to or their employers wouldn’t grant them leave. Sons living in Nepal didn’t always prove pillars of strength either. Some of them came, stayed a night, and went back to their lives in the towns and cities.
The villagers had the materials needed to re-build but they didn’t have enough labour. Some couldn’t afford to hire labour. For all they knew, they might have to live under tarp roofs for many months to come.
In one corner of their courtyards were the corrugated roofing sheets and a small pile of tools provided by relief agencies. In another their wooden ploughshares languished, washed clean by the rains, denied its union with the succulent earth. Should they build a shelter before the monsoon came down with its full force? Would they be able to, with so few young men and carpenters and labourers around? Would they be able to plant the rice on time? These were the doubts that made moving on from the earthquake a plod.
The people I met in and around Nepane hardly, if ever, indulged in self-pity. Perhaps after decades of living in a place as unforgiving as a Nepali village, they had developed a deep distrust for it.
This habit of theirs made maintaining objectivity very hard at times, at others, almost effortless.
On the other hand, decades of living in a place as unforgiving as a Nepali village had fostered in them a weakness for mirth. The timing of their unrestrained, infectious and often uproarious laughter never failed to surprise me. I would be interviewing a group of women whose houses had been destroyed. Many of them were without a man in their house. One of them would be talking about the debilitating impact of the earthquake on her life.
The room would be silent, the other women listening, staring at the walls or their own feet. And almost as soon as the speaker had completed a poignant sentence, an old woman would crack a joke about how she had slipped while trying to run during an aftershock, and the room would erupt into laughter as if they were all at a dinner party.
The same laughs reverberated in the half-collapsed verandahs and inside tarp huts. They were tremors against which somberness collapsed like a house of cards.
After a few days in the village and several conversations with its residents, I began to notice that the villagers regarded pity and sympathy as things too precious to be squandered on oneself. They were to be saved, to lavish later, say, on the guy who was going around asking questions and scribbling in notebooks, and who had suffered (in their eyes) because he had had to walk in a drizzle without an umbrella.
During my time in the village, I met families that had lost their entire stock of grains. Others had lost a buffalo that was their only source of income. But everyone I met, without exception, had salvaged their dignity. Every day, they wore it when they went out to their rendezvous with hardships, when they waltzed with suffering.
They showed me that the most valuable possessions – valuable because they enable us to stay on our feet when life starts throwing punches – are the things we carry inside of us. On my second evening in the village, I stopped near a chautara to look at the surroundings. A cool breeze blew, cooling the body into forgetting the overwhelming loss all around.
Before me was the classic Nepali highland landscape of endless rows of hills, billowing clouds, and a silence that evoked silence. The only thing new in the scenery was the clusters of tangerine tarpaulin shacks.
A woman came out from a poky shelter of blue tarpaulin. She asked me where I was from and I inquired what she had lost in the earthquake. We talked for a while. Then, as I turned around to leave, she said, in words that would have found the mark even if I was someone who had lost a house, “The air is sweet in our village, bhai.”
The Gorkha earthquake shifted Kathmandu by a couple of meters. It cracked hills and pulverised houses. But after spending two weeks in villages where hardly a building was left standing, every time a person shattered through her victim’s shell with a fit of laughter, I realised that the quake had barely scratched the surfaces of their spirits.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tremors-of-laughter-reverberate-in-quake-ravaged-nepali-village.html,travel
5 things to know before going on the Manaslu Circuit Trek,"Tuesday, May 8, 2018","
Tourism in Nepal is flourishing as the country saw a million tourists for the first time last year. Most of the million came here to see mountains and trek around the mountain region. But, over the year, more and more domestic tourists are heading out to explore the less travelled trails of Nepal like the Manaslu Circuit Trek which is one of the most beautiful treks one could go on.
Relatively unknown here are a few information that might come in handy when going to Manaslu.

For Everest Base Camp and Annapurna Base Camp treks, the ending points of the treks are the base camps, and then from there, you return to your jump off points.  For Manaslu, it is different.  As a matter of fact, Manaslu Base Camp trek is more well-known by the name Manaslu Circuit Trek. In this trek, Manaslu Base Camp is not the destination, but is instead only a side trip.  For the Manaslu Circuit Trek, you are making a loop in your trek so you start in Sotikhola or Arughat, reach the Tsum Valley, stop by Manaslu Base Camp, cross Larke pass and then end up your trek in Besi Sahar in the Annapurna region.
In Base Camps treks, these are normally your main destination and then you usually return to where you started. For a Circuit Trek, the starting point and end point are always different.

Towering above the pine forests of Nepal’s Budhi Gandaki River Valley, the mighty Manaslu is nicknamed “killer mountain” by locals because more than 60 people have died on its treacherous slopes.
The world’s eighth highest peak may not be as famous as its bigger neighbours Everest and Annapurna, but it is really challenging due to its fickle weather.

These parts of Nepal do not have many tourists during the peak season because most haven’t heard of the trek so it is advised that you take someone along. Because the trek isn’t as safe as others, it is not permitted to go on one’s own.
It is recommended that you take someone along with you and if want to know more, should you take a guide who will give you information about the village and the mountains seen from there.

The reason the government has asked trekkers not to go alone is because the region is dangerous and after the 2015 earthquake, it is also prone to landslides and rock fall. A reason why it is better to be in the know to make sure you are safe. The danger zones come along as you pass from Khorlabesi to Tatopani and in route to Yaru and after crossing the Larke Pass. Ask the guides or the locals about more danger zone and keep yourself safe.

The Manaslu trek is definitely one of the most alluring trails you could choose to go trekking in Nepal. Unlike ABC or EBC, you will not a find a huge crowd of people flocked in Manaslu circuit. This is because other mainstream trekking trails are more popular amongst the tourists.
And because of that, there aren’t many tea houses or lodges around the place and during the peak season finding a good lodge spontaneously can pose up to be a big problem. So, a smart move would be to book yourself a proper night’s sleep beforehand by talking to the owner of the place you stayed a day earlier, and they shall avail you the contact details of lodges for the next day.
The main problem might come at a place called Dharmashala where there is only one lodge with around eight rooms. Which why it is advised to book in advance, otherwise you will have to spend the night in tents.

How to get there
Take a bus from Kathmandu to Arughat of Gorkha. From there, you can take a jeep or walk for 5 hours to get to Solti Khola from where the trek normally starts. It’s completely up to you where you start your trek from. After Soti Khola, it’s time to stretch your happy feet along. The official Manaslu trek ends at Besisahar. However, you can cheat a little by catching a bus from Dharapani.
Phone network
Networks in the region are pretty poor so tour operators advice to take a CDMA SIM along with you as NTC and NCell don’t have proper connectivity around the region.
Charging
Besides the telephone network, the power in Manaslu Circuit is supplied through solar panels or local hydropower projects. Some places do not have access to power. The charging is easily facilitated in places supported by the hydropower projects. But you will definitely face difficulties in charging phones where solar power is used. And some lodges have even started to charge at a certain rate per hour.

"Three years after Nepal quake, Jiddé Budi is back in her ‘house of stories’","Thursday, May 3, 2018","

I first met her while trekking to Gosainkunda. My friends and I had walked up to her village with an old man who was headed home, a village a bit farther down on the trail to the sacred lake.
When he stopped at this ramshackle place for a bowl of chhyang, we decided to join him. Thus we entered the lair of the teller of some of the tallest tales I have ever heard in Nepal.
She introduced herself as ‘Jiddé Budi.’
Jiddé was her husband’s name, so her name was short for Jiddé ko Budi (Jiddé’s Wife). Her hut had the look of something between a permanent dwelling and a temporary camp. There was no attempt at décor. Two benches flanked a table. A bamboo cut into a cup served as an ashtray. There were no decorations on the walls. Strips of meat hung from rafters directly above the hearth. That was her specialty—stir-fried smoked meat. And chhyang.
As Jiddé Budi shuffled around to ladle out corn chhyang into aluminum bowls, a man sipping the thick spirit asked us where we were headed.
“Gosainkunda,” we told him. The drunk’s expression turned pensive. “There is an evil serpent that lives near the lake,” he said. Like drunks, he didn’t wait for permission or invitation. Without anyone so much as having uttered a word, he went into the storyteller mode.
The story was about a shaman who lived long, long ago. The shaman travelled to Nag Kunda, the lake where the serpent lived, to challenge him to a duel. Before he dived into the lake, the shaman instructed his wife to beat his drum and to keep doing so no matter what.

A long duel ensued underwater. Outside, the shaman’s wife beat the drum. The shaman eventually triumphed and surfaced with the vanquished snake draped over his shoulders. Seeing the macabre creature on her husband’s shoulders, the wife lost her wits and, throwing the drum away, fled.
Without the drum’s beating, the shaman was powerless. He became the serpent’s meal. This story, our drunken folklorist, concluded was proof not to ever trust women. Not stopping for a second what she was doing, our hostess shot back, “Men always blame women.”
Maybe because she feared another misogynistic tale was forthcoming or simply to tell a better tale, our hostess took on the storyteller’s role with a round of stories. She told a story about Birbal, the witty minister in the Mughal Emperor Akbar’s court. Though nobody asked for it, she did an encore. She certainly relished telling stories. When she told stories she enacted them, delivering lines like a theatre actor.
That was the first time I had been in Chisapani, a small village through which one passes if trekking to Gosainkunda from Sundarijal in Kathmandu. I have returned several times after that visit, making it a point to stop at Jiddé Budi’s to hear more of her outlandish yet irresistible tales.
The second time that I visited her, I was with a Chinese friend. As soon as she learned my companion was from China, out came a story that even the most jingoistic Chinese would have trouble believing.
“They say that the Kathmandu Valley is a dowry from the Chinese emperor. He said to his son-in-law, ‘Here, take it. grow chilies in it.’”

That particular serving, although without a grain of truth in it, was the best example of how she managed to run her inn as much on lore and legends as on food and drinks.
Another time she told me the story of when her father took her down to Kathmandu for the first time. They arrived in Tundikhel and saw Tibetan refugees camped there. The men were wild, with matted hair and clad in rough gowns. “From time to time they reached into their gowns and fished out black hunks. They bit off mouthfuls, stowed away the pieces in the gowns, and chewed. I asked my father what it was that they were eating and he told me that it was dried yak meat.”
Those stories – outlandish, intriguing, historical – now seem the only link between her village before the 2015 earthquake and today.
Jiddé Budi’s house, like so many others in Chisapani, was razed. Hers was a wooden hut, so was easy to rebuild, though their larger house, down in another village, needs proper rebuilding. For now, she is back in her hut. Meat hangs from the rafters again; the bamboo ashtray is on the table (she gave me one as a souvenir).
Music plays on the radio.
There is chhyang.
And, oh, for anyone willing to stop at the nondescript hut and give her the slightest pretext, stories.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/three-years-after-nepal-quake-jidde-budi-is-back-in-her-house-of-stories.html,travel
Why pilgrims from India and Nepal throng to see an orchid that blooms in April,"Sunday, April 29, 2018","An orchid that blooms around mid-April in a garden of historical and cultural significance in Siraha, eastern Nepal attracts hordes of pilgrims from both India and Nepal every year.
The locals in the area of the garden, known as the Salahesh Fulbari, believe that the flower blooms on the very first day of the year, 1st of Baishakh (the first month in the Nepali Calendar). According to legend, the orchid symbolizes the garland offered to the folk hero Salahesh by his beloved malin (a Maithili word for a female gardener).
Fascinating folklores, cultural demigod
Not much has been written about Salahesh, also known as Sailesh (the king of mountains) and Jayavardhan. However, in the southern plains of eastern Nepal and adjoining states in Bihar of India, there are many folklore stories featuring Salahesh and his adventures. Different versions of folktales handed down from one generation to the other talk about Salahesh’s bravery and his love for his malin.
According to one legend, Salahesh used to visit the Salahesh Fulbari to pick flowers for use in religious rituals after performing his ablutions. He would meet four sisters who were gardeners there, and in due course, he fell in love with one of them. The orchid which blooms in mid-April every year, according to locals, symbolizes that love. Young couples visit the garden on the Nepali New Year’s Day to receive blessings for their love and express the hope that their love would last long just like that of Salahesh and his gardener love.
According to many stories about Salahesh, he was a Dusadh, a member of the so-called untouchable community. He is also claimed, however, by the Danuwar community. But Salahesh is worshipped by all, irrespective of caste and ethnicity. With time, he has evolved for several communities from a Dalit hero into a demigod.
Mythology versus science
While hundreds of thousands of pilgrims flock to the Salahesh Fulbari each year to get a glimpse of the famous flower and worship Salahesh and malin, science says something else.
Although the locals claim that the flower blooms in the early morning on the first of Baishakh and wilts in the evening, the orchid blooms appear before the onset of the New Year.
The Nepali government’s Department of Plant Resources has identified the flower as the orchid Dendrobium aphyllum (Roxb.) C.E.C. Fisch, and the famed tree on which the flowers bloom as Bischofia javanica Blume or bishopwood, locally known as haram.
Also known as hooded orchid, this species was discovered by William Roxburgh in southern India. It is found in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
While the myth about the flower’s species and the timing of its blooming and subsequent wilting in the Salahesh Fulbari has been busted, deep-rooted faith and obeisance to demigod Salahesh keep people from visiting the garden before and after the Nepali New Year’s Day. And they continue flocking to the Salahesh Fulbari to see this strange and legendary flower that blooms early in the morning and wilts in the evening, only on the 1st day of the Nepali New Year, as per their belief.

Tiger before my eyes: An unexpected encounter in Bardia,"Thursday, April 26, 2018","I heard the driver say tiger, but he said it like he had seen a jackal. He didn’t slow down or go faster. Photo: Sagar Giri
Wisps of mist rose like incense smoke from the meditatively slow river. Across it, the jungle was still in a deep slumber. We waded barefoot, halfway up to the knees, stepping easily from a village into Bardia National Park, the largest protected area in Nepal’s lowlands.
Tulasi, the veteran jungle guide who was my chaperon for the day, did not take the crossing lightly. “We are now in a jungle,” he began as soon as I had put my shoes back on. His tone was ceremonious, like a teacher ushering in a new pupil at a gurukul, the Vedic school in which students lived with teachers in a forest hermitage. “There are tigers and rhinos and elephants here. It’s rare, but if we run into any of them, there are certain ways to protect ourselves. If it’s a tiger, never turn your back on it; stand tall and stare into its eyes, then walk backward, one step at a time. If a rhino charges you, hit it on its nose with a stick. There is only one way to escape an elephant: climbing a tree—a tall tree.”
Tulasi then handed me a four-foot-long staff, as though it was a rifle. I looked around. We were on a jeep track that bisected a grassland. The nearest trees were several hundred meters away, and they were all sal hardwoods, straight as Roman columns, their first limbs some thirty feet from the ground.
I processed the survival tips and our surrounding topography, and in my head, Tulasi’s spiel condensed to: Each man for himself when under attack from a wild animal.

After the statutory pep talk, Tulasi turned onto a trail that passed through grass ten feet tall. I kept picturing a rhino or a tiger charging us around a corner. I tightened my grip on the stave Tulasi had given me. Of course, by then Tulasi was in tiger-showing mode, an avatar that guides in Bardia assume when in the jungle. In that mode, their desire to find a tiger is second only to a tiger seeking a partner during mating season.
As I walked behind the old-timer, I wondered what I had done to give him the impression that I was desperate to see a tiger. One of my happiest childhood memories is being in sal forests, to which my uncle and cousins occasionally took me when they went hunting. Those days of combing dappled jungles for quarry ceased abruptly when Maoist guerillas moved into the wilderness. But now, the rebellion over, I wanted to be among the ancient sals again. I harbored a faint hope of seeing a tiger, but it was never the reason for my coming to Bardia.

For Tulasi, a visit to Bardia was meaningless without a tiger sighting. At the time I was visiting, the tiger frenzy had spiked due to the sheer good luck of a Scot who was staying at the same resort as me. Tulasi worked there. The Scot had seen a tigress and her two adolescent cubs on his second day in the park. Tulasi told me that news the first time we met. His tone seemed to imply that it was now up to me to match the foreigner’s feat. He was asking me to rise above my tourist’s status; I was a Nepali first and foremost. A Nepali had to see at least one tiger.
The Scot, on the other hand, exulted around a campfire about the spiders on his room’s adobe walls and the mouse that made nocturnal visits to fossick in the empty potato chips packet under his bed. He mentioned tigers almost as an afterthought. “This place is what Scotland must have been like two centuries ago,” he mused, delighted at having traveled back in time.
Our march ended on the high bank of a sluggish stream. A noticeably worn out spot turned out to be the coveted hideout we had walked like crazy to get to before others. The place was called Tinkuné, literally ‘three corners.’ The view – the confluence of two almost stagnant streams – was hardly worth sitting for hours on the buttock-numbingly cold sand.

But Tinkuné was a promise, not instant gratification. Across the second stream, behind a belt of trees, was a large phanta, a grassland. The place was tailor-made for a tiger: the tall grass provided cover to hunt and eat in, and the stream was its water cooler. On our side, a screen of drooping branches gave humans a slight chance against the jungle folks’ superior senses. All we had to do was stay hidden, keep still and quiet and, with a bit of luck, we’d see a Panthera tigris.
It took more than luck to see a tiger, however. You needed to be as still, as camouflaged and as quiet as a tiger stalking prey—qualities that were Tulasi’s second nature. He could sit stock-still, eyes scanning the landscape, for well over an hour at a time. He barely spoke when in the jungle; outside, he couldn’t stop talking. Occasionally, he sprinkled anecdotes of tiger sightings into the simmering silence, as though to make it more palatable. “Only last year I was with a gori [white woman] from England. She had a huge camera. We were sitting right here when from nowhere a tigress and her cubs walked out on to the bank there” – he pointed to a sandbar across the stream – “The gori took dozens of photos. She even gave me one. It hangs in my house.”
The recounting irritated me. I had begun to covet a tiger sighting.
Waiting – suffering – in the hideouts had its rewards, but I, hungry for a tiger, never fully appreciated the beauty of those moments at the time. Across the stream a rhino sauntered along the bank, sampling the grass. Spotted deer and hog deer browsed peacefully, their composure itself a clue that no tiger was near. In one place there was a sinuous mark on the wet mud—the bodywork of a python. Also in attendance was a match made on the Mongolian steppe—a Ruddy Shelduck pair, conversing in sonorous honks. And sunlight glinted off a Smooth-coated River Otter as it suddenly surfaced.

Tulasi sat beside me, an old sage taking in the scene before his eyes, ready to whisper a morsel of jungle wisdom.
One afternoon, as we sat scanning the banks, an elephant descended to the stream some hundred and fifty yards from us. One by one, dozens more appeared. A large bull elephant with tusks that were National Geographic cover material trundled down to the stream and stopped right in the middle. He stood there for the next twenty minutes as his herd, from cows with little calves at their heels to dilly-dallying adolescents, crossed over to the forest on the other side. It was a scene from a textbook on a family.
Tulasi told me I was very lucky to see such a large herd—29 in all. Bardia’s wild elephant population is a shadow of what it once was. Encouraged by the government’s quelling of malaria in the Terai, thousands of people migrated from the hills to the fertile lowlands in the 1960s. Axes swung and great swathes of prime elephant habitat vanished. Pachyderm numbers tumbled.
Bardia’s elephants have lost a lot to humans, but once in a while, they get one over them. Like on the day before we had seen the herd. We were in Bagh Machan, a fifty-foot high wooden tower, breakfasting on hard-boiled eggs and flatbread when two men came riding upon an elephant. Tulasi knew them. They were employees of a high-end park resort. One of their female elephants had eloped the night before with a wild bull. The mahouts were out to find her. The scene encapsulated Bardia beautifully: the wildness and vastness of the place, human encroachment on it and their follies, and sweetest of all, the urge to mate, if not love, triumphing.
The Bardia guides’ obsession to see wild animals resembled the paparazzi’s thirst for celebrities. Whenever two guides met – in a hideout, on a trail in the jungle, at the park’s entrance gate or in the village teashop – they asked each other about animal sightings.
What did you see? When? Where? Never an inquiry about the other man’s family, the preamble to the Nepali Book of Conversation. I felt sorry for their families. If thinking more about another creature than one’s wife is betrayal, then Bardia’s guides were lost cases. Above their bedposts would be a framed photo of a tigress; below it a guide snoozing, dreaming of his next sighting of the striped beauty.
Of course, that was a harsh way of looking at a guide’s professionalism.The truth was that guides in Bardia depended so much on the wildlife to sustain their lives that they had become non-participant members of the ecosystem. On days he was guiding, the fifty-five-year-old Tulasi got up at four in the morning, sometimes walked nearly twenty kilometers in the sapping heat, and sat patiently for hours.
Not to mention the risks of being a jungle guide. He did all this to feed his family, to send his sons to colleges in Kathmandu. If he was obsessed with a tiger it was for me, although his zeal made me wonder at times if he was also trying to surpass a local record for most tiger sightings.

The day after we’d seen the elephant herd, Tulasi suggested we take turns sleeping while we waited in the hideout. I was first. I lay on the warm sand, rested my head on a log, and fell asleep. Shortly after, Tulasi shook me awake. He put a finger to his lips to signal me to remain silent, then pointed to the stream. I thought only a tiger would warrant such a stress on silence. I rose slowly and peered over the bush. A swamp deer stood in the middle of the stream, motionless, neck erect, ears cocked, ready to bolt at the slightest sound. The stillness of the moment deepened her beauty. But I wasn’t too impressed. I was under the spell of the tiger: beauty to me was whiskers, stripes, and paws.
Tulasi and I tried for several days to see a tiger. We walked for hours to get from one location known for tiger sightings to another and spent hours in hideouts. We even took a break and went to see Nepal’s last wild herd of blackbucks, which had gotten so used to humans that they let people get to within thirty feet of them before sauntering away toward a couple munching on peanuts. But we didn’t see a tiger. After three days of waiting for a tiger, I ran out of patience. I decided to leave. Tulasi suggested I return in spring. He assured me I would see a tiger then.
A year after the last time sitting in the hideout with Tulasi, I was on a bus cruising on the highway that goes through Bardia National Park.
I heard the driver say tiger, but he said it like he had seen a jackal. He didn’t slow down or go faster. I looked out the window and saw a large tiger. He looked back at the bus as we passed by. There was none of the legendary fieriness in his eyes, only a haggard look that was perhaps a feline sigh.
Inside the bus, safe and detached, I felt no excitement. No heart-thumping, no adrenaline rush. I understood the lack of emotion in the driver’s voice. Both he and I had only seen the tiger’s body. The bus was too fast, too detached, too safe to allow us to get a feel for its spirit.

Places to stay
Thakurdwara, the village at the doorstep of the Bardia National Park, is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of hotels and guesthouses. You will be spoiled for choices there. Here are some recommendations:
Tharu Home Resort
As the name suggests, this place is built and decorated to resemble a traditional Tharu home, complete with finger-painted animal figurines on the facades of huts. It combines the traditional and the modern to provide a comfortable stay in the midst of nature. The place is solar powered, so guests don’t plunge into darkness with Thakurdwara’s frequent power outages. Rooms start at 1000 rupees a night.
Attractions: a pier extending into the canal in front of the hotel makes an idyllic spot to unwind at the end of a sapping day in the jungle. The Tharu cuisine here is delicious.

Anjali Dolphin Resort
The name is almost an attempt to camouflage the exquisite taste of the owner of this resort. Everything – from straw mats to the bed sheets to the dustbins – in the small cottages here are designed and woven by Tharu craftsmen. The walls and floors are adobe, done like the interiors of Tharu houses. There is nothing traditional about the bathrooms, whose fittings would rival any luxury hotels of Kathmandu. The resort is owned by a Frenchman, and he lets it be known through his dining room, which is decorated beautifully, down to the plates with Maithali paintings and custom-made cutlery.

Road trip to Rasuwa,"Monday, April 16, 2018","
Road trips, to me, are a joyous escape. Get in a car, listen to good music and you roll down the windows (or not) because usually, you’re going somewhere fun.
That fun place this time was Rasuwa where we were to assess the development work being carried out by various aid agencies in Nepal. After driving for around nine hours we reached our overnight stop Gatlang, a village in Nothern Rasuwa. Gatlang, is known to many as the ‘black village’ as all the houses in the area once had black roofs. But after the 2015 Earthquake, most houses in the village have no roofs.
Part of the Tamang Heritage Trail, the village, before the earthquake, used to see a lot of tourists but now the flow has virtually stopped. Most tourists, who come to see the ‘black village’, leavethe  place disappointed.
The black wooden roofs have been replaced by tin ones as the people don’t have enough money to replace the wood.
On an evening stroll around the village, I came across many who were affected by the earthquake and were slowly rebuilding their houses with the grant they received from the government.

“I was drinking with my fellow mates when it all happened,” says Dil Bahadur Tamang whose “world came crashing down with this house.” And it hasn’t been easy for him after breaking his leg in the earthquake he has had a tough time getting back on his feet. He works hard to rebuild his house.
Most houses in the area are made up of stones, and as these don’t have concrete pillars, the earthquake took a heavy toll on them. “The initial aid that we received was not much but it helped a lot. At least the tents we received put a roof over our heads,” says Tamang who now feel that the no help is enough when one loses so much.
A brief stroll around the village brought us to our overnight stay, Langtang View Homestay, a lodge/tea house at the bottom of the village. The lodge was rebuilt after the earthquake and the first floor didn’t look very strong as most of it was made from wood. After having a healthy local dinner we went to bed wishing to see the mountain in the morning.
Our wakeup call at 4:30 am wasn’t a knock on the door, but the literal sensation that our roof was going to fly away. The wind was rapid and made a noise that felt like the whole floor was moving. The gale gave us little choice but to wake up, and as I left the bed to go outside.

Then I got my first glimpse of the Langtang mountain. Far away between large hills, I could see the top of the mountain where the rays of the sun were just hitting the mighty mountains. And after admiring the mountain and the valley, our group had breakfast and left to explore the village.
Many stone houses in the area suffered structural damages but many were still living there. “People here still want to live in these old houses because they relate to it. Most of us have grown up in these houses, a reason why I am rebuilding it in a similar way,” says Ram Tamang who adds that the window he plans to put in his house costs around Rs. 50,000.
Building the houses in its traditional forms will definitely be expensive which is why many are replacing these stone houses with bricks and HELVETAS, a Swiss INGO, has been training both men and women to make earthquake resilient homes.
This initiative trains 10 workers who learn the basics of building an earthquake-resistant house starting from laying the foundation to placing the roof and what even more encouraging is that they make sure they have 30 per cent female representation in the groups.
While driving to Rasuwa, I read that it is a district full of lakes and we were later informed that there was a lake around 20 min drive uphill from the lodge. So we drove up through a pine forest where we saw multi-coloured rhododendrons and reached Parvati Kunda, a popular pilgrimage during Janai Purnima where thousands of devotees visit the sacred pond and nearby temple.
We also found out that there was a DDC (Dairy Development Corporation) factory a few miles up and not wanting to miss out on fresh cheese, we climbed further up. We reached a green meadow where some yaks were grazing. Unable to get fresh cheese as their production had stopped, some of our team bought cheese and we were on our way to Goljung.

Goljung, like Gatlang, was another village under-construction. There we visited a stone cutter’s house where Norbu Tamang and his wife Chewang Gyalmo Ghale cut stones using a machine and earned a decent living.
Most people in the area break stones using hammers due to which the houses don’t have a still foundation. But as this village has better road connectivity and most men in the village go to Kerung to work, houses here have been built using bricks as it saves more time and effort, even though it’s a bit expensive.

After talking to a few people and to avoid driving on bad roads for the entire day, the next day we left for Dhunche. Driving past a relatively dry river on dusty roads we climbed up some tough terrains suited only four-wheel drives as we passed Shyaprubesi and reached Dhunche a stop from where most pilgrims head to the holy Gosaikunda Lake.
Our next day would be spent mostly on the car which is why we went to bed early. Unlike the lodge in Gatlang, the one in Dhunche was comfortable and to my surprise even had hot water and wifi. And after a hearty breakfast, we drove to some of the most remote parts of Raswua.
Our destination was Langbu, a village near Yarsa. Driving from Dhunche to Langbu was extremely tiring as the entire day we drove on roads not meant for cars. We passed through huge scenic rocks some perfect for climbing but people don’t seem to visit these areas as they do think it good for tourism.
We reached Langbu, a small village with less than 200 houses. There we ate lunch at Curry Ghale’s house and talked to women who were involved in making foot trails from Langbu to Abu Kharkha.

Walking around, I notice that most houses in this area have been rebuilt with support from the Batas Foundation and Chaudary Group but none of them look authentic as they have used tin doors and window along with bricks.
After a few hours in Langbu, we left for Kalikastan our final overnight stop. On our way there we couldn’t help but stop to click pictures in a small waterfall and at that point where all of us forgot how bad the road was.
Driving off-road for a few hours we finally saw fresh tarmac which was welcomed after moving like a pendulum for the entire day. But even though the ride was tiring it was worth it as we experience rural Nepal like never before.
One the final night most of us had a heavy dinner which included dal-bhat-tarkari-masu and locally produced ghee which was extremely fulfilling as it might just have been the best meal of the entire trip.
The next day we left early for Kathmandu, but on our way visited two CSEB (Compressed Stabilised Earth Blocks) firms. One firm in Pipaltar was owned by a woman who has for the past year has been producing around 500 blocks a day to meet the demand she gets from remote areas of Nuwakot and Rasuwa.
The other firm in Bogatitar was owned by a school teacher who had employed local women to produce the blocks. It was encouraging to see the women work to sustain their family and earn a modest living by working 5-6 hours a day.
The trails around these regions saw a lot of tourists during the tourist season which helped many sustain themselves. But after the earthquake, the flow of tourists have stopped drastically.
In times like this tourism is what will help them get back on their feet and give them a steady income but without promoting places like Gatlang or Langbhu that will never be possible.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/road-trip-to-rasuwa.html,travel
What will be highlights of Everest climbing this season?,"Sunday, April 8, 2018","
The spring climbing season of this year has begun on Mount Everest, finally!
The beginning is marked with preparations of safe routes for the expeditions to start. Icefall doctors hired by the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee have made their way to the Mount Everest base camp to carve out safe routes for the mountaineers coming to the scale the world’s highest peak.
The SPCC says that the new routes will be safe for the expedition to start. However, due to bad weather, the icefall doctors are taking time to make the routes which were severely damaged in the avalanche triggered by 2015 earthquake.
The route from Everest Base Camp up to the Camp II is always prepared by the SPCC.
The route from the Camp II to the summit will be set by Expedition Operators’ Association of Nepal.
Icefall doctors have apparently reached Camp II by the end of last week and the expeditions are due to begin from the first or second week of May.
Every year people spend six weeks going up and down the mountain from Base Camp to acclimatise, before making an attempt on the summit.
TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympian cyclist Victoria Pendleton will be pushing climbing Everest to support the British Red Cross.
Mountaineer Steve Plain is one summit away from completing his bid to climb the seven highest peaks on the seven continents in record time after conquering the “beast” of Denali.
Similarly, Lhakpa Sherpa is set to climb Mount Everest from the Tibetan side this spring seasons with a mission to break her own record as the woman climbing the highest peak of the world for a record ninth time.
Talking about records, Kami Rita Sherpa is looking to climb Everest for a record 22nd time when he leads his expedition this season. He is currently tied with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa all of who have climbed Everest 21 times.
A 70-year-old double amputee from China, Xia Boyu, will also be climbing Mount Everest this season. Xia who had previously made four attempts to conquer the top of the world never made it past the base camp. It’s monumental because the government had banned amputees from climbing the Everest; but the Supreme Court had later issued an interim order to stay its implementation.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/what-will-be-highlights-of-everest-climbing-this-season.html,travel
Varanasi: A Nepali experience in the Timeless City,"Monday, April 2, 2018","
No one enjoys the narrow alleys in the vicinity of – and which inevitably lead to – Varanasi’s famous ghats more than cows and hashish peddlers. The former trundle through the alleys, devouring food left on the doorsteps by devout locals, who revere them, affectionately addressing them as Gau Mata, Cow Mother. The latter lurk in strategic corners in the alleys. As tourists pass by, they sidle up and whisper “hashish” into their ears as though they were uttering a word that contained all the wisdom of this ancient city beside a sacred river. The alleys are like universes, smelling of cow dung, and buzzing with a blend of Japanese and Italian.
The alleys are no man’s land bisecting the newer city and the timeless ghats, between the city struggling over right-of-way and the other still rooted in rites and rituals. Leaving the peddler awaiting the next unsuspecting ear to pass by, I would walk along the banks of the Ganges, entering any compound that didn’t look private. These often turned out to be ashrams and temples. They were quiet places, with either a caretaker snoozing in a chair or a priest cleaning the inner sanctum.
On the other side was the Ganges, flowing like it had for centuries. Its great width – well over a kilometer – meant its waters monopolized the view to the east: if you looked in that direction, you contemplated on the water and all that happened on it or at its edge. It was easy to understand why many Hindus chose to spend their last days in these tranquil places beside the river believed to have descended from the heavens.
The banks of the heavenly river must have drawn people since time immemorial because Varanasi (the name alludes to the Varuna and Assi rivers, two tributaries of the Ganges that merge in the city) is the oldest city in India and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It has changed names a couple of times – from Kashi to Benaras – suffered the marauding army sent by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to destroy its temples, but its significance has survived undiminished. It’s like the Ganges flows by and deposits something magical on its bank that powers the city’s spiritual life.

Laying eyes on Mother Ganga is not enough for most Hindus; they need to feel her. That is why hundreds of people descend to the ghats, wide stone stairs leading down to the edge of the river, on any given morning. Undeterred by the flotsam and garbage lining the shore, people waded in and, chanting the praises of Ganga Maiyya, dipped into the water several times. It is said that bathing in the Ganges washes away any sin accrued by a person. The water’s purifying qualities are a matter of belief, but the belief that brings people here itself has a wonderful effect. You cannot help but marvel at the old man, emaciated with age, ribs protruding, shuffling to the water’s edge, wading in, mumbling a prayer, and dipping into the river several times. Ancient customs are the patterns of everyday life in Varanasi.
The Sacred and the Secular


Dashashwamedh Ghat
Mythology puts this ghat as the site of a sacrificial offering of ten horses by Brahma (dash: ten; ashwa: horse; medh: sacrifice). It’s the most crowded and colorful of Varanasi’s ghats. Varanasi is called the City of Lights and it becomes clear why when you visit this ghat in the evenings. It turns into a surreal spectacle as elaborately choreographed aarti is performed on it.
Gallis
The senses are under constant assault in Varanasi’s gallis, the narrow alleys that form a labyrinthine network through the city. The smells are unpleasant; ears ring with the miraculous claims and ceaseless spiel of touts selling everything from silk to hashish; eyes reel trying to take in the deluge of sights from shimmering embroidery works to oncoming motorbikes to corpulent cows trundling through the alley. Varanasi’s gallis may lack the spaciousness, cleanliness or tranquility of an ancient city, but they offer instant insights into the culture and lifestyle of the place that can hardly be had if you steer away from these frenetic arteries.
Sacred Sites
Vishwanath Temple
This temple is the beacon of Varanasi’s spiritual heritage as well as a monument to its adherence to traditions. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in the middle of the seventeenth century. The temple, which was rebuilt in 1776 by Ahalya Bai of Indore, is dedicated to Shiva’s Vishveswara (Lord of the Universe) manifestation. Another monarch, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore, provided the 800 kilograms of gold that went into plating the temple’s towers. In terms of spiritual merit, only bathing in the Ganges is more important than a visit to this temple.
Gyan Kupor Well (Well of Knowledge)
This well is located near the Vishwanath Temple. It is said that the water from this well had magical properties: anyone who drank it would have a deep spiritual experience. That claim cannot be verified, for the well is now covered. It is also said that the well was sealed to conceal a Shiva lingam originally housed in a temple that was destroyed by Aurangzeb’s forces.
Durga Temple
This temple was built in the eighteenth-century by a Bengali queen. The inner sanctum of this shikhara-style temple houses an image of goddess Durga.
Tulsi Manas Temple
This temple occupies the same site where once the poet Tulsi Das lived and wrote the Ram Charit Manas, the Hindi version of the Hindu epic Ramayana. The temple’s walls are adorned with engravings of verses and scenes from Ram Charit Manas. Many of those scenes come alive each day at this temple during the daily enactment of Hindu mythological tales.
Beyond the City
Sarnath
Sarnath, located 10 kilometers from the bustling Varanasi, is where the Buddha gave his first sermon. The tranquility of its gardens is deepened if one has spent some time in the boisterous Varanasi. A walk through the place is a meditation, whether on the Buddha’s message, the history, and significance of the place, the beauty of the surroundings, or the very fact that you don’t spend more time in places like these. One of the most impressive sights in the Sarnath area is the massive remnant of the 34-meter-high Dhamekh Stupa. (The Chinese scholar Xuan Zang, visiting in AD 640, wrote of a 100-meter-high stupa). The present structure dates back to 500 AD, but bricks from 200 BC have been discovered at the site. The ruins of a large monastery and a broken Ashokan pillar are redolent of a time when Buddhism flourished in the area. There is a museum across the road from the ruins. Visit for a swift lesson in the tumultuous history of this site, which once had a monastery with 1500 resident monks but which disappeared off the map in the 12th century until its rediscovery in 1835.
Ramnagar Fort
This majestic building across the Ganges from Varanasi is the residence of the former Maharaja of Benares. It is also a museum. The pomp and splendor of the palace no longer exist here but it still houses several of the trappings of a regal life. These include a line of vintage Fords and Cadillacs. Grander still are the gold-plated elephant howdahs and silver palanquins. The item that you are likely to stand in front of the longest is a masterpiece of ingenuity. This is an astrological clock that depicts the position of the sun, the moon’s phases, and provides astrological information, besides serving the banal function of telling time. Perhaps the best experience the fort affords is the opportunity to stand on the stone platforms at its western end, watching the Ganges flowing by and the timeless city across it.

To Eat
There are restaurants and eateries in every corner of the tourist section of the city, which parallels the Ganges. Shops selling local delicacies abound, too. Varanasi is famous for its dairy products—yogurt, lassi, and sweets. And you won’t have to look too far for that almost indispensable after meal item: pan.
To Stay
There are countless hotels in Bengali Tola, a locality that sits parallel to the Ganges. The Urvasi Guest House has clean rooms, a cozy little restaurant, and a rooftop with views of the Ganges. Other budget accommodations in the area include Ganga Yogi Lodge and Singh Guest House. There are also guesthouses that are tucked away from the bustling tourist section of the old city. You need to wander and explore a bit to find these.
Getting There
There are direct flights to Varanasi from Kathmandu several times a week. You can also travel to Sunauli, on the Indian border, and go by taxi or bus to Gorakhpur, from where you can catch a train to Varanasi.
Special Things to Remember
Varanasi is unbearably hot during the summer months, especially just before the arrival of the monsoon (June). The heat can suck all the fun out of sight-seeing, so it’s best to avoid going there in summer. The narrow alleys of the section of the city along the river can easily disorient you. No one wants to ruin their experience by having a blabbering guide along when you go exploring, but it is also not a bad idea to ask your hotel staff for directions to your destination before heading out. And whether you are hiring an autorickshaw or want a room, don’t hesitate to bargain; Varanasi folks expect it.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/varanasi-a-nepali-experience-in-the-timeless-city.html,travel
"Farmlands, pagoda and sunrises: The Sankhu-Nagarkot hike","Sunday, March 18, 2018","Kathmandu Valley’s religious and cultural heritage–manifested physically in temples, shrines, ponds, wooden and stone carvings – seem a bit out of place in the midst of concrete buildings and traffic. They evoke a yearning to see them in their original, rustic settings. Needless to say, the pollution and congestion also stifle people. So it is a veritable escape, a physical fleeing from this oppressive environs, when your vehicle start going downhill a little east from Boudhanath, from where the road to Sundarijal and Sankhu branch off. You feel like you have just managed to cast off a weight that was holding you back. A bridge and a bend later, you are driving past the green island of Gokarna, the largest and densest forest remaining on the Valley floor.

As you climb to the top of a hill and then descend you come out to a timeless scene. On artistically carved and furrowed fields, depending on the time of year, rice plants or the green stubble of wheat or the yellow carpet of mustard. Tiny figures of various hues—farmers tending to their crops – dot the land. Lifting your gaze to the hill to the south, if you catch it at the right angle, you see a glint on its peak—the gajur of Kathmandu’s oldest temple, Changu Narayan. It’s a classic Kathmandu Valley vista, one that is lost in most parts so is doubly pleasing on the eye.
I had some apprehension in visiting Sankhu, one of the oldest Newar settlements in the Valley, after the earthquake. I feared the ochre-faced houses would have been supplanted by gaudy soulless, concrete ones; tiles from roofs dumped on a newly carved out road, carved wooden windows rotting away in neglect. I knew I would have to confront the town’s transmogrification.
I found enough to lift my spirits. Although the houses around the western town gate were like those in any small town – two story houses, ground floor a shop – further down there were some old buildings. Most of the old buildings were mere architectural relics, reminders of the Rana period, whitewashed with forest green windows. Titled, cracked, roofless: it seemed a strong wind would topple them. They were doomed, not in a condition to be spared when the next road expansion scheme came around. For now, they had a visual appeal, a break from the monotony of identical concrete buildings. And it was quaint to find a post office, padlocked, with a letter box still hanging by its front door. Next to it a Land Cruiser had been entombed, rusting back to the elements bit by bit. Both the building and the vehicle were dwarfed by an immense pipal tree. A signboard on the post office’s façade said that the place was Mann Bisaune Chautari, Resting Place for the Heart.
Resting our hearts and feasting our eyes on the giant tree my companion and I walked on, heading north on the road toward Vajrayogini. We stopped for tea and snacks in the village teashop, thronged by locals sipping tea as they sunned in the square. It was a family-run place. The man of the house (who had the task of washing the cups and plates) turned out to be the antithesis of the shy Nepali villager. He introduced himself to my foreigner female friend, asked her name and, when my friend extended her hand to shake his, kissed it, bowing like Leonardo DiCaprio did when he kissed Kate Winslet’s hand in Titanic.
Around the bend from the romantic man’s teashop, we were in the midst of fields. A small canal ran along the road. In one place, there was a small shrine, a square patch filled with stone statues of gods and a tiny Ganesh temple. On a long stone bench-like structure we found some small, round potatoes. Offerings to the gods? Or had they fallen out from a doko when a farmer had rested his load on the bench? I liked the shrine’s spartan look: no extravagance, no intricate artwork, nothing but devotion given form in stone. Here was a shrine dating back to Kathmandu’s agrarian past.
We continued toward the colorful prayer flags arching over treetops to the north. Below the flags, concealed from view, was the Vajrayogini Temple. The earthquake of 2015 had taken a toll on the temple. The inner sanctum of the temple was now encased in plywood walls. All around it was rubble: bricks, tiles, wooden beams. What had once been a large courtyard was now a cramped space where devotees were burning butter lamps. The Buddha was in residence in the temple on the eastern side of the courtyard, which had somehow survived the quake. I climbed to the ramp on which the sanctum now stood and got a glimpse of Vajrayogini, made an offering to the fund for rebuilding this revered site, then was tricked by the priest into buying another butter lamp, a reminder that no place is too sacred for manipulation.
Our next destination was Changu Narayan, a hike across the fertile farmland from Sankhu to the summit of the Doladri Hill to the south. Half an hour’s climb up the terraced fields across the Manohara River offered a painting-like scene. Neat grids of furrows, with black dots that were manure piles. Farmers were dots of colors. Smaller than them were the white specks of egrets. Laughter and banter wafted up from the fields. Then, like a stone rupturing the tranquility of a pond’s surface, the sight of a man showing a piece of land to a couple. Potential buyers from the city. For how long would the terraces remain farmland? How long before there is a resort where now I was, drinking in the sight of one of the last remaining rural settings in Kathmandu?

It’s a bad idea to visit Changu Narayan on the way to some other place. The third-century temple stands in the middle of a courtyard strewn with some magnificent stone sculptures. The center piece, of course, is the temple. Its ornate tundal (strut) alone would take hours to fully appreciate. After a quick look we headed to our day’s final destination: Nagarkot.
The trail to Nagarkot turned out to be lonelier than I expected. Although it passed through small settlements and, once, even past a large group of picnickers, there were stretches of forests peopled only by adventurous teenagers who had come all that way for some privacy. In one place, as we passed by a trail that descended into the dank forest, we heard grunts. Peering in, I caught the glint of sunlight on a wild boar’s tusk. It was a sounder of boars, digging up the floor for their evening snack. In my excitement I had been careless: wild boars are notoriously territorial, and do not hesitate to charge when intimidated by intruders. The trail was too steep for the bulky beast to be able to run up, I reasoned, fooling myself.
Telkot, the settlement we had been told we could get buses to Nagarkot from, was a couple of shops on a bend in the potholed road to the hill station. We clambered into a bus that had gone on ahead when it slowed down to negotiate a narrow part of the road. There was nothing remarkable about the bus, but its ticket collector had the dourest look I have seen on a Nepali. That accentuated his sharp features, giving him the piercing look of models one sees in magazines.
The bus collector finally smiled. It took a chiding from a girl who had asked the bus to stop some two hundred meters before where it finally halted. He smiled cheekily as he handed her a sack. When he climbed back in and the bus moved, he had the Robert Pattinson look again.
The landscape was bathed in a burnished copper light when the hotels of Nagarkot came into view. Silhouettes of people were visible on an empty space. They were watching the orange orb descend behind the hills. When we got off the bus, it was dark, stars starting to fire up in the sky, Kathmandu engulfed in twilight, hidden from view. Not that it was on our minds. In Nagarkot, you only think of sunrises and sunsets.
Sankhu to Nagarkot via Changu Narayan
Duration: At a relaxed pace, with ample rests, the hike from Sankhu to Nagarkot, with a detour to Changu Narayan takes between six to seven hours. If you do this hike in winter, set out from Sankhu as early as possible to give yourself plenty of time for stops for lunch and snacks.
Grade: Easy. Other than the climb after crossing the river from Sankhu this hike is not taxing—unless you continue on foot from Telkot to Nagarkot.
Route: Get off where there is a big signboard for the Sushma Koirala Memorial Hospital. It is a graveled road going south from the main road to Sankhu. The road will eventually go downhill, with the hospital on your right, to the fields. There are numerous trails after crossing the bridge over the Manohara River that wind up toward Changu Narayan. Ask the people working in the fields or locals you will meet on the trail for directions. Basically, you need to go southwest, following the ridge of the hill to its westernmost point, atop which sits the Changu Narayan Temple.
The trail to Nagarkot from Changu Narayan starts near the vehicle entrance fee collection booth, which is situated some three hundred meters before Changu’s big gateway. Facing east, take the middle road of the three you can see. It’s a graveled road; the one on the left will be the one you came up from Sankhu on and on the right is the paved road to Bhaktapur. Twenty minutes later you will arrive on a hilltop with an antenna. Check with people you meet whether you are on the right track or not. For a while after this there is but one trail until to come to a fork in the trail in a forest. Take the one going uphill (left); there is an abandoned looking resort to the right. You will be walking through dense woods after this point until you meet the paved road to Nagarkot at Telkot. You can get a bus to Nagarkot from there or walk up the eight kilometers.
Transportation: Buses leave for Sankhu at ten-minute intervals from the temporary bus park situated to the south of Ratna Park. Ask the ticket collector to drop you off at the road to Sushma Koirala Memorial Hospital. When you get on a bus to Nagarkot at Telkot make sure you ask the fare first. You might be ripped off if you expect every bus to stick to the standard fare.
Budget: Lunch and dinner and an inexpensive hotel room (shared by at least two people) will set you back 1500 rupees. Carrying 2000 rupees should cover any additional expenses that you might incur.
Sleeping and Eating in Nagarkot
There are numerous eateries along the road at the main bazaar in Nagarkot selling simple fares like noodles, momo, samosa and sel roti. Hotel Marigold has all the amenities you would desire in a hotel: clean rooms, comfortable beds, hot water and tubs. And it’s easy on your wallet. The only downside is that it doesn’t boast a view of the mountains. If you can live with that, this is a bargain. Their food is also delicious, so you can come here for meals even if you stay somewhere else.
Note that on weekends Nagarkot is often booked to capacity. Make reservations if you don’t want to arrive in Nagarkot and only be left with expensive hotels to choose from. For bookings in Hotel Marigold, contact Gokul Lamichhane on 9841430468.

Beyond Nagarkot
You can avoid repeating the bus journey back down to Kathmandu by opting to hike from Nagarkot to Dhulikhel. You can also shorten the hike a bit by going down to Banepa instead of Dhulikhel. From both of these towns on the Arniko Highway you can get a ride to Kathmandu.
The trail to Dhulikhel or Banepa branches off from the paved road that goes up (south) to the sunrise viewing tower. Turn left at the hoarding board for the Bhangeri Darbar Resort. You will walk past a sandstone and ochre-coloured resort. Another resort, sprawling over several acres, will be next. The next half an hour will be a walk in the woods. When you come out in the open again, continue until you come to a tin-roofed shelter on the trail. There will be a trail forking downhill from there. Take it if you want to go to Dhulikhel. Your destination is Bhanjhyang, visible to the southeast as a cleft between densely wooded hilltops. If you prefer to walk down to Banepa instead, don’t turn off from the trail at the shelter. Instead, continue down the same trail. You will soon come to a small village. Ask the people there to show you the trail to Sera. A paved road begins in Sera. You can get a bus there to take you to Banepa.

Besides being the oldest temple in the Kathmandu Valley, Changu Narayan is arguably the oldest pagoda temple in the world. Hindus come here to worship Vishnu, who resides in the central temple. The temple is also sacred to Buddhists, who worship the central images as Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. In the southwestern corner of the courtyard is the Killeshwor Mahadev, a Shiva temple. In addition, Ganesha and the goddess Chinnamasta are also in residence here, occupying shrines in the southeastern corner. Even non-believers wouldn’t feel out of place in this magnificent repository of ancient stone sculptures. The Vishnu image in the northwestern corner is one such example. It was this plethora of statues of gods and goddesses and mythical creatures that led Perceval Landon to remark in his book Nepal:
“One remembers all the wealth of carving of the rest of the Valley; one remembers the woodwork of Peking, the Queen’s golden monastery in Mandalay, and the temples at Nara and Horiuji in Japan. But when all is recalled it is probably to the shrine of Changu Narayan that one offers the palm.”",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/farmlands-pagoda-and-sunrises-the-sankhu-nagarkot-hike.html,travel
Meeting ‘Mr Pandy’ on Kathmandu’s picturesque cycling trail,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018","
We were riding on the Mudkhu-Teen Piple-Jitpur-Phedi-Kavresthali-Sangla circuit, a 25km round-trip which happened to be one of my frequent spins on my mountain bike. This route is also favored by many riders of Kathmandu.
Ours was an odd bunch. There was Lisa, a British lady from East London. She came to Kathmandu to do a CELTA course run by the Cambridge University and conducted by the British Council, Kathmandu. I came to know Lisa by pure chance through an old friend who happened to be doing the same course with her. My other co-rider was Shayeet, my neighbor.
Another oddity that marked our group was age: I was 65 years old, Lisa fortyish and the youngest Shayeet was just a kid, 17. More surprises seemed the order of the day. When I looked at Lisa’s bike, I almost got a shock.
It was an old rundown 6-speed Chinese bicycle that she bought at almost a throwaway price (Sorry, Lisa, for the throwaway remark!). God, the bike did not even have the suspension forks! Frankly, I would not ride it for all the tea in China! Shayeet had a Trek, a 29er, a hardtail (9-speed) and mine was a Trek Fuel8 dual suspension (10-speed), the high-end bike among the three.
My ten years of mountain biking has taught me to ride safe and always wear a helmet. I learned it the hard way after enduring loads of bumps and bruises. I always made sure my co-riders wore helmets. No helmet, no ride. To my dismay, Lisa had a ludicrous turban around her head resembling a woman’s brimless hat instead of a helmet, which I later learned was a buff-gear we use to cover our noses against the dust.
Helmet or not, I had to bow down that day because we did not have a spare one and we were running short on time. We started around 9.30 from Jalpa Chowk some 10 minutes from my place. At the first incline that began shortly after we started, I was cocksure, Shayeet, and I would leave Lisa way behind considering her low-geared bike.
Lo and behold, as it turned out, I was the last one to finish the climb after the two of them! She proved me completely wrong. Wow, lady, you’re a real tough rider, I said to myself! Little wonder she looked so athletic and carried that shredded physique. Later, I learned she ran, too, and had participated in some marathons back home.
The strapping young Shayeet is a natural athlete. He plays soccer, futsal, does weights at a gym and cycles. So, as it turned out, I was always behind the two when it came to climbing. Hang on–not on the downhill though; the two could not keep pace with me when I barreled down the slopes like a pro.
Mudkhu Bhanjhyang was like a half hour ride, the paved road on a mild gradient all the way. We stopped for a while at the police check-point for a breather and to sip water. The densely forested Nagarjun hill towered on our left behind the high walls of the Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Park. The next leg to Teen Piple was really dusty.

As the road was undergoing construction, we were sprayed with clouds of dust almost like every five minutes when a heavy tip truck roared past. Even my buff would not shield me from the thick dust. We must have inhaled a ton of dust by the time we made it to Teen Piple.
After Teen Piple, it was pure country, away from the dust and pollution of the city. The jeep-track going up and down led through small settlements and farmland. It was wheat time. The terraced fields with the young wheat grass sprawled over the hillside cascading down into the lower valley like a green carpet. In the distance was Kathmandu looking leaden and gloomy under a perennial pall of smog.
Lisa was doing fine save for a few occasions when the chain came off the chainring on the gravely slopes. That was not a big deal. I was afraid her rusty old wheels might buckle instead while doing the rocky downhill. After something like 40 minutes, we arrived at Jitpur Phedi.
History has it that the demure little settlement was named Jitpur after King Prithivi Narayan Shah (the first king of Modern Nepal) won over the Kathmandu Valley (Kathmandu, Laitpur and Bhaktapur). He had his barracks stationed at this village prior to the victory. To our left, I could discern the faint mark on the face of the high hill, which was the Tarkeswor Mahadev (a Shiva temple).
After Jitpur I felt we should stop for a cup of tea made from buffalo milk, a rarity in the city. It had become second nature to me to have a buffalo milk tea on every ride I made into the countryside. I kept on looking for a tea shop but given the odd time (it was close to noon), some of the shops did not have tea, missed some, and others were closed.

After Jitpur, the gravel track again cut across open country and a panoply of greenery. I kept looking at the roadside teashop as we pedaled on enjoying the rural landscape. At a place called Kavresthali, I spotted a teashop and stopped to ask.
“Sahuji (shop-owner), do you have buffalo-milk tea” I called. A pot-bellied man with graying stubble appeared and said, “Yes, we serve tea made from organic buffalo milk.” The three of us looked at each other and smiled at the use of the word ‘organic’.
The tea was good and refreshing. Then, I noticed the sahuji kept on eyeing Lisa as we sipped our tea and talked. “Are you British?” The shopkeeper suddenly asked Lisa.
“Yes, how did you guess?” That surprised Lisa. The guy then fell into a conversation with her . . . in English. Surprised, we listened to him as he told us he had stayed in England for a couple of years.
Before going to England he worked in a restaurant for a decade in Manali, a Kullu Valley town in the Himachal Pradesh, India and after the first few years there visited Goa to work during tourist season. Goa–a land of sea, sun, sand, spices and cashews–a multicultural hub–was a place where he could earn as much in a season (4 months) as he earned in a year in Manali.
“What’s your name?” I asked. “Pandy, like a candy,” he replied with a smile. We all smiled, too. Later, as we prepared to leave, I asked him why that funny name ‘Pandy’.
“My actual name is Kamal Prasad Dhakal. I’m a Brahmin or a ‘pandit’. During my stints in Goa, I met a lot of tourists. They always asked my name. Now, it was kind of difficult for them to call me by my Nepali name. So, I decided to name myself Pandy, a short form for ‘pandit’. There was another round of smiles among us. Interesting chap, I said to myself.
We did not stop the rest of the way. Shayeet and I were getting late for lunch and Lisa had to see someone in the afternoon. The downhill at Sangla gave us all a real kick. The uneven gravely road was steep, narrow, pitted at several places and strewn with pebbles. Obviously, I was in the lead. To sum it up, it was tricky and required skillful handling. A rider at the speed I was doing could break several bones if he flipped.
Shayeet and I parted with Lisa at Jalpa Chowk. Lisa was happy, so were we, like always, after a ride into the hills and the country. That’s mountain biking. As we headed back home, Pandy’s words kept coming back to my mind. He sure seemed an idiosyncratic character and I thought he would definitely make an interesting story. I decided I should take another ride in the coming week to Kavresthali to see Mr Pandy.
The story continues . . . .

"Fishing for a cause in Roshi: How we saw a river depleted, degraded and violated","Thursday, February 15, 2018","Fishing has always been an abiding passion for me. So, I jumped at the idea of a fishing trip (some seven years back) to Roshi Khola (river) when my teammates planned it. It was, however, a different kind of fishing–electro-fishing to be more exact. And it was more a mission than a fun trip.
Electro-fishing is a scientific process of stunning fish by using electric current powered by a portable backpack generator or battery. The current is delivered by a pair of electrodes that comes with the equipment. Exclusively used for scientific surveys, fishery biologists use it as the most humane way of catching fish, before releasing them back into the wild.
Our purpose too was a scientific survey aimed at determining the fish abundance, density and species composition of the Roshi River. We had to catch fish to carry out our mission. Electro-fishing, when done properly, results in no permanent harm to fish.
Sadly, to the detriment of our aquatic life, for the past decade, people invented crude replicas of this equipment for the indiscriminate and unethical killing of fish on a mass scale for eating and selling, which has reached epidemic proportions the length and breadth of our country.
We were five in all, Arun, Vikas, Kumar, and I. Professor Bibhuti Ranjan Jha was a guest and our mentor. Everybody addressed him as Jha Sir, so he was ‘Jha Sir’ to all.  A senior environment scientist at Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, he had volunteered to join us as our ‘guru’.  The equipment and all the paraphernalia for the survey were provided courtesy of Jha Sir.
It was almost noon when we arrived at the Roshi Bridge via the Banepa-Sindhuli Highway. As we sped along the new highway (paved only up to Nepalthok then), all eyes turned to the clear Roshi after it appeared as we crossed a bridge over it. The Roshi tumbled past rocks and boulders strewn all along the watercourse as it snaked through the narrow valley.
The river Roshi is named after a tiny village (Roshi Gaon) located on a hillside some three kilometres from the old historical Newar town of Panauti, seven kilometres south-east of Banepa.
Noted once for delectable asla (snow trout), the spring-fed river drains from the high Phulchoki hills (above Godavari), and converges on the Sun Koshi river at a small settlement called Dumja (on the Sindhuli-Bardibas highway), some 55 km from Dhulikhel.
The Roshi today, however, stands depleted and degraded. Over-fishing (electro-fishing included), burgeoning settlement, development works (during the highway construction), and massive excavation of sand, gravel, and boulders has violated the once pristine river.
Except for Professor Jha, all four of us (avid anglers) represented an NGO involved in the conservation of aquatic resources of our country.
As we drove down the highway surveying the river that flanked the road, we passed by a stone-crushing site by the riverside. The gin-clear Roshi after that point turned disbelievingly turbid and continued that way—getting worse as a few kilometres down another plant spewed silted water into it.
At a place called Dumja, the lesser Roshi finally merged with the robust Sun Koshi River at Dumja. It was shocking to watch the dark chocolate Roshi in stark contrast to the turquoise water of Sun Koshi as it tumbled into the big river.
Our survey began at the Roshi a little farther up Nepalthok where the water was clear and unsoiled by the stone crushing factories. The balmy day with the sun not too strong promised an agreeable weather. Without further ado, our team pitched into work. Care had to be taken as the riverbed was uneven with slippery gravel and stones.
Off went the foursome (Kumar, Arun, Vikas and Jha sir) into the Roshi, knee-deep (waist-deep some places), struggling against the current upstream. Kumar, weighed down by a bulky generator on his back, clumsily waded through the water holding the ominous looking stick with the electrodes, which he kept poking into the water while his other hand fiddled with a switch that delivered an electric current.

Arun and Vikash in unwieldy waders flanked Kumar, holding long staffs attached to dip nets. The work began and the duo started jabbing the staffs left and right to trap the stunned fish. Prof Jha brought up the rear with a plastic bucket that held the fish netted by Arun and Vikash. All were wearing chest long mandatory rubber waders (with boots attached) to avoid the risk of getting electrocuted.
I elected myself to be the team-photographer and no less excited than my colleagues, clicked furiously on my Canon G-9 from the banks. At first sight, it looked like total bedlam, a bunch of weirdly outfitted guys working the river with long staffs in frenzy.
“Hey, try that eddy…no, no not that one, the one on your right,” an over-excited Arun bellowed at Kumar. “Shove the stick deeper. Try to reach underneath the big boulders”. Everyone had to yell over the sound of the rushing water. Now it was Vikash’s turn to shout: “There, there . . . Arun, the fish are to your left.”
Professor Jha apart, the young men (in their early thirties then) launched themselves into a raucous bubbling energy, worth watching.  Excitement mounted with the passing of every minute.
Words flew. The yelling took newer heights. As expected, the entire scene of frenetic activity coupled with the noise successfully drew a small local crowd, who watched in awed silence.
Suddenly, when only five minutes remained to complete the first leg of the operation (15 to 20 minutes to be done at 2 different stretches), the generator coughed, sputtered, belched out black smoke, and died to everybody’s,  “Oh, no!”
Despite several attempts, the gen-set refused to budge.  All four reluctantly waded out the river.  And then, Vikash stumbled, lost his footing, and crashed into the water followed by a burst of guffawing from the gathered local crowd.
As it turned out, the gen-set had its spark plug fouled.  A quick scrubbing of the plug did the work, though and the gen-set kick-started to everybody’s . . . “Hurray”! Since that particular stretch was already disturbed, we worked up from a different spot downriver.

It was time for a lunch break. We helped ourselves to hefty tuna sandwiches–by courtesy of Arun. After a lip-smacking lunch and a bottle of chilled Coke, we all got down to the final work. An excited Kumar checked on the day’s catch stowed in two different buckets.
As it appeared, the last combing operation had yielded more fish, finger size and smaller. Every fish had to be taxonomically categorised by its native identification, scientific name, weight and length. The total count of each species assessed its abundance in the river.
I took a little time off to satisfy some of the local fellows’ curiosities. A local fisherman with a cast-net slung over his shoulder seemed the most inquisitive. After I explained to him about our survey, I asked him: “So, how is your fishing going on?”
“Very little, sir; it’s not like what it used to be. Ten years ago, my cast-net brought enough fish to support my family. There are no fish in Roshi, today.  I fish these days in my spare time only, doing odd jobs to earn my bread,” lamented Krishna, the local fisherman.
Of the eight different species captured, totaling 214, Bhote Gadelo, a loach (Schistura Rupecula), had the highest abundance (106 total count); next were, Katle, copper mahseer (Neolissocheilus hexagonolopis):53, and Buche Aasla, Blunt–nosed Snow trout, (Shizothorax richardsonii):12, to name a few.
None of the catch, disappointingly, included the Golden Mahseer, tor putitora, (the most-coveted fish by the anglers) although the spring-fed Roshi offered adequate rocks, pebbles and gravel beds—a perfect spawning ground for this species from the Sunkoshi River.  “Darn it!” snorted Vikash to show his frustration.
It was time for the fish to be released. Arun volunteered and grinned from ear to ear at the camera. The locals watched in awe; bewildered (although we had explained) at the entire catch being released.
Darkness approached while we packed up for the day. We shook hands with Krishna and the local bunch, who kept us company to the last bit, and piled into Arun’s battered old jeep (almost 30 years old!) that screeched and groaned with faults in every conceivable part.
A little later, as we crossed the Roshi Bridge, I looked back at the river to find in the fading light a streak of silver that wound its path across the darkening valley, as gentler hills stood out on two sides in somber silhouettes. We really had a fantastic day of fishing . . . and for a good cause, I mused.

Weekend exile: Sundarijal to Chisapani to Pani Muhan,"Monday, February 12, 2018","Walking past the little bazaar at Sundarijal, a huge rusty iron water pipe running through its centre, is nothing remarkable. You are either a visitor going up to see the waterfall, the reservoir or walking up as far as you can, or a hiker leaving a human habitation for the wilderness. But there is a sequence of sorts.
First, you see the tea shops, their counters crammed with sel, malpuwa, samosa and jeri. Next, you pass Nepal’s second hydropower station. Then a couple of houses, with laden grapefruit and tamarillo trees in their kitchen gardens; spinach and cauliflowers and spring onion sprouting from neat beds. You buy a ticket to the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park at a small booth, then continue the climb. Then a soothing sight for the mind and an excuse to rest the body: a big waterfall. The last building along the trail is a Nepal Scouts Training Centre, formerly a house where BP Koirala, Nepal’s former prime minister, was once imprisoned under orders from King Mahendra. Although unintended, the building’s location and history become a statement of sorts: This is the site where a man was exiled from society; you are on the border between city and the outdoors.
For a visitor today, that site marks an exit door of sorts, a way out from the confines of the Kathmandu Valley into the wilderness. Walking past that building, a Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park entrance ticket in pocket, it’s as if you’re free once again, moving deeper into forests, higher and farther from the haze-veiled city, closer to the mountains. The Sundarijal reservoir appears; its turquoise waters a welcome excuse for stopping. The Bagmati is beautiful here, unmolested, oblivious to the defilements awaiting her once she leaves the protection of the national park.
The next house that appears is one of several that make up Mulkharka, a small village of terraced fields, houses with protruding wooden balconies, corn ears hanging in them, looking like a huge centipede. Turning around, you see, framed in a ‘V’ formed by the ridges of two hills on either side of the ravine, the long corrugated tin roofs shimmering in the sun, splotches of green around them: Kathmandu. You notice that there are many more concreted houses now in Mulkharka. The 2015 earthquake turned most traditional stone-and-wood homes to rubble. A few survive, their sides plastered with earth, flaky and cracked in places, blackened in others by soot from wood fires.

A dappled trail through a forest of tree trunk to tree trunk moss carpeting, wisps of old man’s beard hanging from branches. Scuttling feet that turn out to be a covey of kalij pheasants. Vultures wheeling in the sky. That is the hike for the next four to five hours after Mulkharka.
At the end of those hours of surrendering yourself to the wilderness you arrive in Chisapani. Like a bleached canine, Langtang Lirung peaks from behind a serrated range of black barren mountains, devoid of vegetation and snow. Other mountains are closer, larger, glaciers clearly visible. Beginning with Gauri Shankar in the east, there is an arc of Himalayan giants on the horizon: Dorje Lakpa, Ganesh, Manaslu, the Annapurnas. Chisapani itself is a gateway to longer treks, Gosainkunda and Helambu. But for people who are out in the wild after a long sentence in the city, the mountains, forests, blue sky and the night sky bejewelled with stars are enough.
The walk from Chisapani to Pani Muhan takes you through some of the best preserved forests around Kathmandu. You know that from the size of some of the oak trees, giants seven or eight feet wide, towering a hundred or more feet above the forest. The same trees keep most of the sunlight out, so you hike through a dark, somewhat foreboding, place. It’s clear from the trail carpeted in leaves that this route does not see many trekkers. Only the presence of cow dung, stone steps and tangerine ribbons tied to tree branches to serve as indicators reassures you that the trail hasn’t been abandoned altogether. For that reason, it creates the temporary feeling of being in a foreign land. Mere kilometrse from Kathmandu, you walk under ancient trees, savouring the patches of sunlight, familiarising yourself with this world, plotting your next escape from the city.
Duration: For frequent hikers, the walk from Sundarijal to Chisapani is five hours. If you’re not used to hiking and like to take it slow and easy with plenty of stops, give yourself at least seven hours. Irrespective of your hiking abilities, it’s best to start early from Sundarijal to give yourself the maximum amount of daylight. Another reason for starting early would be to witness the sunset from Chisapani.
It will take between four to five hours for fast walkers to cover the stretch from Chisapani to Pani Muhan. Done at a leisurely pace, it will be a seven-hour hike.
Grade: It’s a climb all the way from the bus park in Sundarijal until you enter the forest above Mulkharka. That is the only stretch on this entire loop that is strenuous. Otherwise, it’s mostly a matter of length than difficulty.
Getting There: Buses depart every ten minutes from the makeshift bus park south of Ratna Park in Kathmandu. Get off at the bus park in Sundarijal and head up the paved trail that runs parallel to the big water supply pipe.
Route: There are signboards at most crossroads on the trail between Sundarijal and Chisapani. You can also ask people for directions. After Mulkharka, there is only one trail that goes all the way to Chisapani.
A quarter of an hour before Chisapani, at the crest of a climb, there is a signboard beside a corrugated tin-roofed shelter. It points to a trail going west from the main trail. You will need to turn right if you are coming from Chisapani; coming from Pani Muhan, turn left and head downhill for Chisapani. It’s natural to doubt whether you have taken the right turn because the trail doesn’t look like it’s used much. As long as you keep seeing tangerine ribbons of cloth tied to branches and the occasional set of stone steps, you are on the right trail. Half an hour later, you will arrive in a small grassy clearing with a tin-roofed shed and a row of small white memorial stupas. A motorable road crosses the trail here. Keep walking, across the road and into the forest. A post with several place names and arrows will tell you that Shivapuri Peak and Pani Muhan are to the west (straight). The next crossroads on this route will be a trail weaving up a hill. Continue downhill. You will arrive at Bagdwar, a small place with a stupa and some huts where ascetics live. No more turns needed after that. Follow the trail all the way down to Nagi Gompa.
NOTE: You can make Pani Muhan, the entrance to Shivapuri National Park north of Budhanilakantha, your starting point for this hike. However, there is a ludicrous rule that requires all visitors to hire a guide. That means an extra 800 rupees.
For some reason the mandatory guide rule is only applicable at the Pani Muhan entrance. You don’t have to pay that fee if you walk up from Sundarijal.
The park also has a ‘one entry, one permit’ system. That means that you will need to buy a new entrance ticket for a new day. So even if you went only to Chisapani, stayed the night there, then came back down the same way, you will need to buy a new ticket for the return trip.
Fuel for the Trails: There are no shops to buy food or drinks after Mulkharka. However, it’s best to fill up on samosa and sel in one of Sundarijal’s many tea shops before heading out. Carry plenty of water with you; there are no sources of drinking water after Mulkharka until Chisapani.
You will need to stock up on food and drinks even more for the hike from Chisapani to Pani Muhan. The only place you will be able to buy food and refill your water bottles will be Nagi Gompa, which is almost at the end of the day’s hike. It’s better to carry all your food and at least two litres of water per person.
National Park entry fee: Rs 57 (Nepalis); Rs 565 (foreigners)
Budget:  2,000 rupees per person
Chisapani rules: Make sure you enquire of your hotel operator in Chisapani about their tariffs. Most hotels there have different prices for Nepalis and non-Nepalis when it comes to meals. Even a thermos of hot water, a complimentary gesture in many places in Nepal, has a price here. There is also a rule in some places that requires you to eat where you stay. Enquire, not assume, when in Chisapani.
Not a place for shortcuts: Remember at all times that you are in a wilderness. Although shortcuts may be enticing, stick to the main trail. There are plenty of cases every year of people taking a shortcut and then losing their way.
Lodging
Hotel Chisopani has tidy rooms with large windows, attached bathrooms and private balconies. The prices are reasonable and the staff friendly. Chisapani being a favourite weekend destination with Kathmanduites as well as the preferred night halt for trekkers heading to Gosainkunda, the village can be filled to capacity. It’s always best to make advance bookings. Hotel Chisopani: 9818723924 (Reema Regmi).
Food
For snacks, head down the road from Chisapani toward a small monastery. Fifty metres from the monastery, on the right, is a shed with a blue door. This is Jiddey Budi’s eatery. She serves the best stir-fried smoked meat and homemade millet wine. You won’t have a dull moment at her place.

Four destinations to start out mountain biking in Kathmandu,"Thursday, February 8, 2018","
Hey guys, I expect my previous three-story series on mountain biking (mtb in short) has helped you get the hang of the basic bike skills and handling; and you must have pulled off quite some off-road short rides to the backcountry.
Maybe you would now like to try some challenging rides.  Let me help you with a lowdown on some locations for you to venture out, which can really turn out as fascinating daylong destinations.
For a start, the destination I am going to chart out for you is a one-day long ride with a moderate to rugged terrains, both paved and dirt including some isolated forested areas. So my advice to you is: Take along a partner with you–so much the better and more fun if you can muster a group of say three to four riders. That will also help you to learn group rapport and group dynamics.
Not to be missed
Hopefully, you will not miss out on the basic essentials for the trip such as a pump, spare tube, patch kit, a toolkit . . . and of course, a rain jacket.  Don’t!  Also, make sure that you are well-hydrated way before you kick off. What I always do before long rides is to drink a litre of oral electrolyte-blended water at least 5 hours before the start (mostly coinciding with a night before) and supplement it with water during the ride. If you are carrying a hydration bladder tucked into your backpack, all the better.
As you sweat a lot and lose a lot of fluid, you need to replenish yourselves to keep yourself hydrated and avoid getting the most dreaded issue like muscle cramps, which can really ruin your entire ride.  Caveat: do not start on a completely empty stomach. A light breakfast before the ride is a good idea.
“Electrolytes are analogous to the motor oil in your car—they don’t make the engine run, but they’re absolutely necessary to keep everything running smoothly. Proper functioning of the digestive, nervous, cardiac, and muscular systems depends on adequate electrolyte levels” writes Steve Born, a sports nutrition specialist.
It will be a good idea to stash in some energy bars or chocolates into your backpack to refuel yourself as you will be burning off a lot of calories doing quite some gruelling up-hills. Also, they can work wonders for your sapping energy and stamina. Bananas, too, can substitute for the energy bars if you forget to carry them.  Needless to write, carry water bottles. And if you wish to have a less sore bum, apply Vaseline under your crotch. And do not forget to put on your padded underwear.

Nagarkot
Everybody knows about this scenic hill town, and most of you might have visited Nagarkot one time or other in a vehicle of some kind.  Of the many cycling destinations, Nagarkot (2,195 metres) comes first in my priority list for beginners as it combines both a tough climb and a thrilling adrenaline-pumping downhill experience. Apart from that, it offers several off-road back routes, some quite challenging.
Nagarkot is like 32-33 km from Kathmandu with Bhaktapur en route. The road is paved all the way.   After crossing the Bhaktapur Bazaar, you have to hit the road to Kharipati. After that, the paved road starts climbing and continues all the way up to Nagarkot. Owing to the recent widening work underway, do not expect it to be a smooth paved ride. The uneven road, gravelly at places, can almost pass for an off-road–so much the better for an mtb rider!
Given the relentless uphill, as a first-timer, it might take you a little over four hours from Kathmandu to Nagarkot including brief respites for a breather and some refreshments; plenty of tea houses line the road. Start early, around seven or eight in the morning, if you want to have lunch at Nagarkot and get back home before dark. Lots of eateries there serve dal-bhat and being a touristy place, also other dishes like pasta, noodles, pizza, whatever you fancy.
From Nagarkot Bazaar, you can ride to the View Tower situated 3.5 km up on a slight hill. You can take a 360-degree panoramic image of the sprawling Himalayas including the Everest if the weather permits and you are armed with a telephoto zoom lens.
The return ride from Nagarkot the same way back will be a half hour to one hour faster since you will be free-wheeling down all the way from Nagarkot to Bhaktapur. Round trip back to Ktm: 64-65 km.
Nagarkot-Changu-Bhaktapur
For the return ride, there are several other options to choose from. First, you can take the Nagarkot- Telkot-Changu Narayan-Bhaktapur (10 km approx.) route which also offers an off-road motor track. After some 3.5 km backtracking from Nagarkot to Telkot junction, you come to a cross-section.
Take the road that goes to Changu. Better ask around, if you get confused about the correct direction. As you ride the Telkot gravelled road towards Changu (6.5km), you come to a fork, the track down goes to Bhaktapur while the one that goes straight heads towards the Changu Narayan shrine.
Said to be more than 3,000 years old and designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Changu Narayan shrine is well worth a visit.  There are two options going back to Bhaktapur:  either you take the paved road or backtrack to the fork you passed earlier and hit the Telkot-Duwakot-Jhaukhel off-road track.  The track crosses the forested Telkot hill down to Bhaktapur past small settlements on the way. Either way, the round trip to Kathmandu will be something like 66-67 km.
Nagarkot-Kattike Bhanjhyang-Shali Nadi-Sankhu- Ktm

Beginners, you will be thrilled to your bones if you hit this trail–a most rewarding experience if you love downhilling. Rugged and challenging this trail will really put your skill to the test. Downhill all the way from Nagarkot, the jeep track is lined by a thick forest until you reach Kattike Bhanjhyang (9 km).
The ride from Kattike, a small settlement, to Shali Nadi, Sankhu (8km) is again all the way down with a section of stone-laden path with steep descents. You have to be extra careful on this bumpy downhill section. The trail crosses isolated forested hills and then gradually opens up to a beautiful countryside as you reach Shali Nadi, another famous Hindu shrine which hosts an annual festival in the month of Magh (January-February).
After Shali Nadi you enter the town of Sankhu also called Shankharapur, said to have been named so for its conch-shell shape. From Sankhu it’s 23 km to Kathmandu or two and a half hours ride. The round trip back home is like 72-73 km.
Nagarkot-Kattike-Jarshing Pauwa-Sankhu-Ktm

This is a little longer route than the rest. From Nagarkot, you descend down to Kattike like you do for Shali Nadi.  You will meet a fork at Kattike. The road to your left goes to Shali Nadi. To head towards Jarshing Pauwa, you have to go straight (4 km) up.  After Kattike, the dirt road starts climbing cutting across small village settlements, forested area, and terraced fields that slope down in a steep drop. If you are lucky, you can see a sweeping view of the snow-capped mountains to your north.
The ride from Kattike to Jarshing Pauwa is like one and a half hours with mostly ascents, some really steep ones.  The elevation of Jarshing Pauwa is 1803 metres. The small village perched on an open hill boasts some good tea houses and a few resorts.
From Jarshinga Pauwa, you are met with a wide paved road that snakes all the way down through a beautiful forest to Lapsephedi and the Sankhu Bazaar (7.5 km).  Round trip to Ktm: 76-77km.
All things considered, the Nagarkot ride promises the beginners a truly thrill-packed getaway, whichever route they chose to ride back–the rides are tough, scenic, educative, challenging–all rolled into one! Caveat: For beginners, this ride can be really tough and gruelling and you might be nursing sore muscles the next day. But it is worth its weight in gold–a most rewarding experience indeed.
Take frequent breaks, soak in the beauty and the ambience of your surroundings, chat with the local people, capture the memorable moments into your camera . . . and do not forget to have that special sweet tea made from buffalo milk at a village tea shop–always my favourite when riding through the country!
Next, I will bring you more such ride info on short, day-long and some longer with night halts. Until then, ride safe and keep the rubber side down!

Five hiking routes in Kathmandu to explore this spring season,"Sunday, January 28, 2018","
Imagine Kathmandu as a geographical mandala. The city, with its streets and frenetic life and crazy drivers, is the centre. The Ring Road is the circular boundary between this urban vortex and the green girdle of hills that tower above the valley floor. Beyond this rim is the even more tranquil, almost paradisiacal realm of mountains and villages, stone trails and moss-carpeted forests. This is how I, a habitual walker and lover of the outdoors, visualise Kathmandu compared to hiking destinations.
Needless to say, as someone who loves to hike and trek, the destinations at the top of my priority list are places as far away from the city as possible.
Sadly, like many city dwellers, there is more wishing in my life than hiking. Living in Kathmandu often turns into an inability to leave Kathmandu. There is work. Or opportunities: an offer is tabled that is too good to pass on. Friends come into the equation: there is always someone who can’t make it this weekend, this time, so the trip is postponed. And, above all, there is the procrastinator in us who tells us that the hike can be done another time. Before you know it you have forgotten about it altogether.
I have postponed more hikes and treks than I have been on. I still have a long list of treks in Nepal I want to do. It’s clichéd but it’s also true: if you want to go, just leave. It’s that simple. However, if you go on one short hike, the chances are you will go on another. After all, you don’t find hikers passionately discussing plans for that epic trip in coffee shops or next to water coolers. True hikers hit the trails, irrespective of the time of year, whether their friends can come or not.
Distance and duration – often the reasons for travelling, for leaving home – can also be deterrents. You want to go on a trek to, say, Langtang, but it’s too far. It will take too long. You don’t have the time. But Kathmanduites needn’t be bogged down by these factors. There are plenty of hikes around the Valley that, though they are no Langtang or Annapurna trek, offer enough of quiet, solitude, wilderness and wildlife to make you hit the trail instead of a Saturday morning movie. Here are some of the best hikes – short and long, easy and exacting – that Kathmanduites can do on weekends, on a shoestring.

The buffet for the senses begins within minutes of taking to the trail on this hike. You go up a narrow alley, a simple path around the corner of a building, from Sundarijal’s small bazaar and come out into the countryside. You climb past houses with pumpkins drying on window sills, pomelo and orange trees in the garden, and cows in sheds. Running parallel to the trail is a huge rusty pipe that carries water down from the reservoir high in the forest. In the ravine below is the Bagmati, flowing merrily, boisterous, clean.
You ascend, your calves object. Just then you hear a crashing sound of water, growing louder with each laborious couple of feet. Soon the source comes into view: a waterfall, plummeting from the dense forest. Water starts, their tails flitting like butterflies, hop from rock to rock.
The climb continues after the waterfall for another hour before you find yourself in terraced fields. This is Mulkharka. There isn’t another village between Mulkharka and Chisapani, so it’s best to buy snacks and refill your water bottles here.
Climbing up from Mulkharka, you enter another forest. The rest of the walk to Chisapani is through dappled forests. It can be a bit frustrating because the trees block views of the mountains. But when you finally get your first glimpse of the mountains towering above Chisapani, not seeing them all day enhances their beauty. There is hardly a better way to end a day than watching the day’s last light drain away, turning the peaks golden one moment, roseate another.
Duration: 7-8 hours, including stops for snacks and rests
Grade: Moderate. The uphill section is from Sundarijal to Mulkharka. Level trail after that.
Directions: Head up the stone trail from Sundarijal toward the reservoir. From Mulkharka, take the trail going northeast (left). Ask locals if you are confused.
Highlights: Waterfall, scenic villages, mountain views
Budget: 2,000 rupees
This hike is ideal for anyone who prefers solitude above all else. Not to say that is its only attraction. If you go in winter, you can begin by spending some time watching the numerous species of migratory birds wintering in Taudaha. The hike begins on the paved road that winds up from Chalnakhel. It’s a steep climb for the first half an hour. The road ends near a monastery damaged in the 2015 earthquake and now under construction, and a trail weaves through a small village of ochre houses. Walking past the houses, the trail climbs again, this time into the dense forest. This is the lonely stretch of the hike, your only company likely to be kalij pheasants foraging the leafy floor.
An hour of steady climbing will bring you to a saddle on the hill. The summit of Champa Devi Hill – and the shrine dedicated to the eponymous goddess – is a further thirty-minute climb west, reachable on flagstone stairs. A similarly paved trail goes to the east, winding down to Hattiban Resort and, further down, to the main Kathmandu-Pharping road.
On clear days, the view to the north is an unbroken chain of majestic peaks; the south is row after row of hills, floating above the haze. There is nothing spectacular about the Champa Devi shrine. It’s a small space with a couple of statues smeared with vermilion. But it’s awesome in its isolation, a place of power that does not invite devotees with its appearance or size but rather draws only those who seek out such places, those who are willing to punish their calves for an hour or two of solitude and a walk in the woods.
Duration: 3-4 hours
Grade: This is not a long hike; but it is exacting, mainly because it is uphill from start to finish.
Directions: Walk south on the Kathmandu-Pharping road after Taudaha. After four hundred metres, you will see a stream flowing across the road. A hundred metres down the road from this point, turn right on the road that goes uphill. This road goes to a monastery. A trail branches off from the road just below the monastery. Follow this all the way up to Champa Devi.
Highlights: Mountain views and a walk through dense forests
Budget: 500 rupees. There are no places after Taudaha to buy a meal or snacks, so carry your own food and water.
Alternative: You can catch a bus to get to or drive up to Himalayan Height Resort. You can also continue on the road to Dollu, from where you need to get to Samye Monastery. There are trails from both these places via the south face of the hill to the Champa Devi shrine. These routes will save you time and offer easier hikes than the north face route. Conversely, you can opt to descend via the south face.
For your calves, this hike is the stuff of nightmares. For the outdoors person in you, this is a long, sweet dream. The immersion in wilderness begins within moments of passing through the gate of Shivapuri National Park at Pani Muhan. Bird songs waft down from the canopy overheard. It takes a hundred metres and a bend on the trail to leave human habitation behind and be in the midst of a pristine forest.
There is a choice of going up to Shivapuri Peak via the Nagi Gompa or taking the stone stairs that branches off from the road a kilometre before the gompa. The latter, because it bypasses the monastery, goes through even denser forest. You labour up through a green tunnel. There are some trees on this stretch that are big enough to stop you on your track. It’s something of a wonder to find a living giant so close to Kathmandu, where every tree seems to be on death row. Persevering up this incline brings you to a small clearing in the forest. Tips of mountains are visible above the trees, titillating, promising stunning views from higher up.
The trail from Bagdwar, the source of the Bagmati River, to the summit is a relentless assault on your legs. In return, you get a 180-degree view of mountains and a smoky ocean with blue hills hovering over it. It’s a plunge downhill after the peak, through an area even denser than the south face of Shivapuri. It’s also lonelier. Occasionally, you will pass a villager headed for Kathmandu. At the foot of the hill the trail meets a gravelled road. There begins what seems an eternal walk to Gurjubhanjhyang. For a couple of minutes, you see vehicles. Your tickets are checked and you continue onward to Kakani, another long walk in the wilderness.
Duration: 10-11 hours
Grade: Challenging, suitable for only people used to for long walks. Involves steep climbs and long descents. The total distance covered on this route is nearly 35 kilometres.
Directions: Start at Pani Muhan, north of Budhanilakantha. A kilometre or so before the Nagi Gompa you will see a signboard that says ‘HELIPAD.’ Take that trail (stone steps). Follow the trail all the way to Shivapuri Peak. After descending from the peak (also stone steps) you need to turn right (north) at the first fork on the trail. This begins a long downhill section, which culminates in a motorable gravelled road. Turn left and head west. It’s a long walk, but you will eventually get to Gurjubhanjhyang, where there will be soldiers to tell you directions to Kakani, which is some eight kilometres away.
Highlights: Old-growth forests, bird watching, possible animal sightings, hours without sight of vehicles or human settlements
Budget: 2,000 rupees. Park entrance fee: 57 (Nepalis); 560 (foreigners)
No shops between Pani Muhan and Kakani. Carry lots of snacks and plenty of water.
Alternative: A watered-down version of this hike would be to walk up from Pani Muhan to Shivapuri Peak and back.


Phoolchoki, the highest of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, remains one of the most enticing hiking destinations around Kathmandu. It has a kind of pull about it: looming in the distance, a needle rising from its peak, it seems like an emblem of adventure, a call to stand on its summit.
Going up Phoolchoki, however, is no mountaineering feat; a gravelled road winds up from Godavari to its peak. A trail also goes up from the same place. The hike begins right at the foot of the mountain, so the walk for the first hour or so is on a steep trail. For religious folks, there is an opportunity to seek the blessings of Phoolchoki Mata at the small temple next to Navadhara, nine waterspouts. Culture buffs, too, will enjoy the conduits and temple.
Phoolchoki has some of the best-preserved forests of the hills around Kathmandu. Birdwatchers can look forward to spotting several species in a day’s hike. With luck, there will be glimpses of deer, wild boars, perhaps even a leopard. Even when the birds are out of sight, they make their presence felt with sweet songs or the spooky sounds of rustling leaves as they forage.
The ‘summit’ is a place of big rocks, a shrine, a stupa and an antenna. But eyes are likely to be looking further away, left to right, at a mountain panorama that includes Annapurna, Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Langtang and Gauri Shankar. And looking down through rents in the smoggy veil hanging over the Valley, you can see Kathmandu and get a true scale of the place, the ancient lake it once was, and feel the pangs of loss of what must have been a place of unsurpassable beauty.
Duration: 4-5 hours
Grade: The first half of the hike is very demanding. It is a relentless climb.
Directions: Take the paved road opposite the Godavari Bus Park. It runs parallel to St. Xavier’s School’s western wall. After the ticket issuance office, head straight if you’re on a vehicle. Go left towards Navadhara, then climb the trail that skirts the temple’s compound. Follow the trail up until it merges with the road (by then a gravelled one). Signboards warning hikers to stick to the trail and not to take shortcuts abound. The reason for this is that there are many trails created by woodcutters that lead deep into the forest. So once you’ve found the road, stick to it.
Highlights: Excellent birding, wildlife, sweeping views of mountains and Kathmandu Valley
Budget: 500 rupees. Entrance fee: 10 (Nepalis); 100 (foreigners). Carry your own food and water.
Godavari to Panauti via Phoolchoki
What was Kathmandu like before it became a bed of concrete houses? This is one thought that might cross your mind when you gaze down from Phoolchoki. Luckily, bits of the Kathmandu of a bygone era survive in Panauti. You can experience traditional Newar architecture in this medieval town by extending your Phoolchoki hike. Head down (east) on the flight of flagstone steps that forks off from the road a little below Phoolchoki peak. There is a worn out signboard nailed to a corrugated tin-roofed shelter that points the way.
This is a long walk, weaving through forests, climbing up hills and passing by hamlets. The length of the hike is matched by the historical and cultural gems in Panauti such as the Indreshwor Mahadev Temple, a three-storied hulking testament to the artistry of the Newars and their ability to preserve traditions that go back centuries.
Duration: 4-5 hours
Grade: It is a descent all the way from Phoolchoki to Panauti. Although you will be walking downhill or on flat stretches for most of the way it is nonetheless quite a long walk. Not recommended if you go on hikes once in a bluemoon or if medieval era architecture sounds Greek to you.
Directions: Follow the stone stairs and you will be fine. The trail will pass through villages in a couple of places. Take this opportunity to confirm you are on the right path and to ask directions for the next stretch. Ask locals for the trail to Chalisé, from where it’s a paved road all the way to Panauti Bus Park.
Highlights: Trail alternates between dense forests and hillocks with lovely views of hills, terraced fields and quaint villages; mountain views; in winter, villages with trees laden with oranges; old Newar houses, ancient temples and a sacred ghat where three rivers merge.
Budget: 1,000 rupees
Alternative: Instead of returning directly from Panauti to Kathmandu there is the option to do an easy hike east to Namo Buddha. The walk takes between two and three hours, the last half hour of which is an uphill climb. Other than that it’s a stroll through an idyllic scene of farmers tending their immaculately raked fields. Add to that the chance to visit a sacred Buddhist pilgrimage site. Worth a visit even if you have no interest in religion or spirituality. The calm and silence and scenic beauty are reason enough to visit.
Directions: Cross the bridge across the road from Panauti Bus Park. Two hundred metres along this road (east) turn right to go to the Indreshwor Mahadev Temple; head straight if you wish to proceed to Namo Buddha.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/five-hiking-routes-in-kathmandu-to-explore-this-spring-season.html,travel
Elizabeth Hawley: The Himalayan record keeper is no more,"Friday, January 26, 2018","
Kathmandu, January 26
She was not a mountaineer; in fact, she never stepped foot on Everest Base Camp, let alone its summit. But Elizabeth Hawley’s work was of Himalayan proportions. A summitter’s journey begins at the Base Camp and ends upon her return–the whole process takes a few weeks when the summitter has to meticulously plan her next steps. Hawley’s journey was over half a century long, and it required a precision comparable to what is required on expeditions to the Roof of the World.
Miss Elizabeth Hawley (95), who was fondly referred to by such names as the Chronicler of Himalayan Expeditions and the Himalayan Record Keeper, passed away in Kathmandu on Friday morning.
Hawley first came to Nepal in 1960 as a reporter for an American magazine, but after meeting a few mountaineers, she realised that Nepal was where she wanted to live in and mountaineering was what she wanted to report on. To make her plans possible, she joined Reuters.
In 1963, following a US expedition to Everest, she started collecting details of summitters and soon maintained records for other mountains in Nepal. Her home in Dilli Bazaar had become her office lined with rows of wooden filing cabinets filled with the detailed, hand-written notes from her interviews. It was in the 90s that the idea of digitising her records dawned on her and she started entering them onto a computer. According to the database, it took more than 20,000 hours (11 years) to digitise the records. However, this did not include the previous 40 years Hawley spent collecting the records.
The Himalayan Database now has details of around 80,000 accents of over 300 peaks in Nepal. Her records have been used in several studies on success and failure among mountaineering expeditions in Nepal. In the mountaineering world, there was a saying: “It does not matter if you are Messner or Viesturs, your summit never happened unless Miss Hawley says it did.”
Hawley spoke to mountaineers passing through Kathmandu, both before and after their climbs. Most of them have said that her interviews were tougher than the actual climb. She asked them details of their expedition which included the duration, mountaineers they met along the way and as proof she always demanded a photograph on the summit. Doing that she gained information on expedition successes, failures, accidents, and deaths.
“We will try and keep up Miss Hawley’s work; but of course today the Himalayan climbing world has lost one of its most important pillars. You will be missed, Miss Hawley,” says Billi Bierling, who started maintaining the database after Hawley’s retirement in 2016, on her Facebook.
Hawley not only leaves behind the priceless database, but also fond memories. “What I liked the most about Miss Hawley was that she was very straightforward and always believed in reporting facts. She never gave an opinion, and during 70s and 80s Nepal was known because of her,” says senior journalist Kanak Mani Dixit. “I learned a lot from her,” he adds.
She was the person in the know when it came to the mountains. Even though she never summitted a peak, no one in Nepal had a better knowledge of the mountains than her. “If anyone needed information about our mountains, they went straight to Miss Hawley because she had all the details,” adds Zimba Zangbu Sherpa, former President of Nepal Mountaineering Association. “Miss Hawley was very strict and didn’t like people who were late or careless,” says Sherpa, who knew her since he was a young boy.
Many mountaineers would have missed out if they hadn’t consulted Miss Hawley. The legendary climber Reinhold Messner said in an interview with Outside that he might not have become the first person to solo Everest without bottled oxygen if not for Miss Hawley. When Messner met her in Kathmandu in ’79, he was planning to attempt the historic climb, but was having trouble getting a permit from Nepal. Hawley informed him that the plan could be possible from the Chinese side of Everest, and that was what he did.
Stories like these show the important role Hawley played when it comes to mountaineering. She seemed to live in her own world here in Nepal connected to everyone from famous climbers to Nepali royals, yet unaware of small things happening outside her door. She did not learn Nepali, she did not even go shopping for her groceries.
When the mountaineering season starts in two months, hundreds of mountaineers, young and old will pass through Kathmandu every day. They might feel relief that Miss Hawley is not there to interview them. But, as they set foot on the mountains, they will surely miss her, even doubt their expedition was successful–Miss Hawley won’t be there to say.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/elizabeth-hawley-the-himalayan-record-keeper-is-no-more.html,travel
Patan: Modern storehouse of traditions,"Wednesday, January 17, 2018","
In the cold winter morning, the small nondescript square was basically an open space in a dense city. Cars with frosted windows and roofs stood in the centre. In a corner, two old Mercedes buses: rusty, parked for life. There was one Rana-era house, white façade, green windows. Next to it, a house half was torn down, presumably a casualty of the earthquake. Only the small temple, askew, propped up by beams, gave a touch of history, of age.
Tendrils of incense meandered up from the temple’s tiny courtyard. On the ground, without any attempt at concealment, were small piles of refuse: beer cans, cigarette stubs, cracker packages. It felt that the temple had been pushed to the metaphorical corner of life, neglected and near collapse. The present belonged, from what was visible, to concrete houses, cars, beer cans and Nepali Congress flags.
Just then a woman entered the courtyard and went into the poky sanctum. It was a Tuesday and she had come to perform puja at this Ganesh temple. She carried a small platter whose dimples contained rice, vermilion, lamp wicks and flowers. But simply in coming to this temple on the verge of collapse, she had brought much more. Her devotion was like a key that opened the doors to heritage. Within moments of her arrival, the tiny temple was a living monument.
I was in Patan, the ancient city. A channel had been opened that linked the past to the present, that woman to her grandmother.
Patan’s ancientness is certainly awesome, but the co-existence of the old and the modern is, at least for me, what makes it a special city. You can wander into an alley at random and find yourself in a courtyard with stone chaityas, intricately carved windows and, as if to remind visitors of the age they are in, motorbikes.
Enticed by the low door and narrow passageway of exposed bricks, I entered and found myself in a vihar, a Buddhist monastery. Patan is famous for them. It was a small square, enclosed on three sides by houses. The west wing housed the shrine. It had a wooden façade. A wooden toran, or tympanum, arched over the small door. A seated Buddha adorned it, with deities in a semi-circle around him. On each side of this sacred and artistic door were handwritten signs pasted on the tiled wall: one informed non-residents that they were not to park motorbikes in the courtyard; the other, right under a faucet with a green pipe attached to it, carried the water distribution schedule (7-8 AM; 6-7 PM).
Thirteen motorbikes filled the courtyard. In front of the characteristic Newar-style low doorways stood seven big, blue plastic drums, filled with precious water. On the east wall were four white oblong plaques with deities painted on them.
Across the street from the square was one of Patan’s most famous waterspouts: Aloka Hiti. In the winter morning I visited, it was quiet. A small group was chatting around a cardboard fire in a tin box. I remembered coming there for a festival during the monsoon. Back then, it had throbbed with a community preparing for a festival. Musicians played Newar instruments. There were mounds of rice. Sweetmeats were arranged to form a painting of sorts. Also on the table was a severed buffalo head. Now, there were people playing badminton in the corner.
Two 5000-litre plastic water tanks rose from the pit where the hitis, or stone spouts, were. There were a couple of diesel generators in a shed. The site of an age-old festival was now a place equipped to pump up and store underground water. In a way there was a beauty in the place’s duality: it was also where traditions were plumbed and stored.

People of Patan understand heritage better, hence they excel at preserving it. They know that the essence of heritage is intangible, malleable, flexible; it’s more realistic to keep it alive than keeping it unchanged. The soul of tradition is what needs to be saved, and it is that they have managed to keep alive. Outsiders are likely to feel a sense of loss or irony when they see motorbikes parked in a centuries-old monastery or a temple. Locals know the place is just being used. It’s utilisation without defilement. It’s dormant, not extinct. Come a certain month, week or day, the courtyard will be emptied of its motorbikes and be filled with offerings and hymns, the murmured prayers of the old and the joyful shrieks of the young.
Fortunately for outsiders, whose lives are not weaved into Patan’s legacy, there are also tangible links to the city’s past, expressed beautifully in architecture. The small gilded window on the Patan Darbar’s (Patan Museum’s) façade is one such architectural link. The central image on it is of the Buddha. He is surrounded by various Hindu deities, all of whom are rendered in smaller size than him. This is amazing given that the work was commissioned by a Hindu king. Portraying the Buddha as a centrifugal figure was probably the monarch’s way of acknowledging his predominantly Buddhist citizens.
Not that the two faiths were considered to be apart. Even centuries later religious synthesis is a hallmark of Patan. “Hindu gods need to be around to protect the Buddha,” Prakash Shakya, a Patan local, explained when I asked about the images of Hindu gods in the Golden Temple. The temple’s main door has the face of Bhairav etched on it as a protective measure and a diminutive statue of Balbhadra protects the main image of the Buddha in the inner sanctum by standing directly in front of it.
The Golden Temple is also the finest example of Patan’s collective memory. Nowhere is the handing down of culture from one generation to another more beautifully manifested. The head priest of Hiranya Varna Mahavihar, as the temple is called in Nepali, is a boy under 12. Each boy is priest for only a month. Local families take turns to send a son to be the custodian of one of Patan’s oldest and most revered temples.
According to legends, during a protracted battle between the Kirants and Lichhavis in Patan, it was too dangerous for adults to venture out of home. So the god at the Golden Temple couldn’t be worshipped. A family decided to send their son, a boy of eight or nine, to wash the god’s statue. The child arrived at the temple, drew water from the well behind the temple, and set the pot of water at the door. He thought god, like adults, would wash himself.
When even after repeated calls to come out and wash himself, the god did not appear. The boy began to cry, fearing he would be late and get a scolding at home. The god took pity on the boy and came out and performed his ablutions. The boy ran home and told his parents what had happened. When the locals learned of the story, they decided to have a pre-pubescent boy serve as the priest since it was clear that the god listened more to the pleas of little boys. That was how the practice of appointing a boy as the priest began. Every little detail of the daily rituals and duties that the boy-priest needs to perform has been passed down from one boy-priest to the next. Since there are no adult priests to teach them the duties and rules, the boy who is to succeed an incumbent starts coming to the temple daily fifteen days before his term starts to learn the ropes.
There is yet another, even more admirable, example of Patan’s uncanny ability to remember things from the distant past. The site of the present palace, which houses the Patan Museum, was once the location of a monastery. The significance of this hallowed site is not lost on the locals even centuries later. Every year in the sacred month of gunla, a large copper tub filled with water is placed in front of the main door. A small image of the Buddha is immersed in the water, a ritual recalling the monastery.
After witnessing locals engaged in rituals that have been performed for centuries, it becomes clear that Patan’s true heritage is preserved somewhere deeper and safer, in a form that can absorb changes and still retain its essence. Heritage has a home in the hearts and minds of the residents of Patan. As long as it resides there, it matters little how many motorbikes there are in an ancient courtyard.
Patan’s gems

Patan Museum
It’s something of an anomaly to recommend visiting a museum before wandering the alleys of a medieval city, but the Patan Museum’s rich collection prepares you for the city’s immense cultural artifacts. It has galleries dedicated to Hinduism and Buddhism, a gallery each on the lost wax and repousse techniques of metal casting and a poky room that houses a Tantric manuscript. Splendid objects are accompanied by succinct texts that introduce the religious, cultural and artistic heritage of the city in a way that allows even lay people to grasp it. Sundari Chok and Mul Chok, two of the palace’s medieval courtyards, are so well preserved that they seem to have been fossilised and then rediscovered. The newly opened architecture gallery exhibits special features of Newar architecture such as pillars, windows and torans.
Golden Temple
The ‘gold’ in its name comes, according to one source, from its gilded façade and roofs; according to another, it’s an allusion to the writing of a sacred text housed in the temple in golden ink every three years. In a historical and cultural sense, this temple is solid gold. It is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, monasteries in Patan. The monastery is a cultural and religious hub: daily recitations of mantras by locals begin at three-thirty in the morning. To get a glimpse of its ancient rituals, stop by at nine in the morning or three in the afternoon. At these times, the boy-priest sets out, ringing a bell, to retrace the path on which the god’s image was first carried into the temple.
Mahaboudha Temple
Tucked in a small courtyard, this shikhara-style temple is also known as the Nine-Thousand Buddha Temple—an allusion to the tiny Buddha figurines that are embossed on every single tile on the temple. The temple is in Sundhara Tole, which is southeast of Patan Darbar Square.
Kumbheshwor Temple
Hulking over the surrounding houses, this five-storied temple is a stellar example of Newar architecture. Its size is not its only appeal, with several intricately carved wooden beams testament to its artistic splendor. The temple is a magnet for the religious-minded. Within its precincts are some of the most revered shrines in the Kathmandu Valley. On the southern side is the Bhairav shrine, which houses a soot-black image of the fearful manifestation of Shiva. Adjacent to it is the Bagalamukhi shrine, which draws throngs every Thursday. The natural spring north of the temple is believed to be actually water flowing down from the holy Gosainkunda Lake.
Chyasal
An ordinary neighbourhood at first glance, Chyasal is a site of historical and cultural importance. According to legend, this was the place where the Kirants staged their last defence of their city against the invading Lichhavi forces. The slightly raised stone platform near the centre of the square, according to local legend, is a lid that covers a pit containing 800 human heads—the head count of the Kiranti warriors who died defending their city. There is no proof to corroborate this claim, but it cannot be entirely dismissed either because ‘chyasa’ in Newari means ‘eight hundred.’
Chyasal has a less macabre relic too. Ensconced on the wall, beside the stone water conduits in the square, is a statue of Gajalaxmi, believed to be the oldest stone sculpture in the Valley. There is also a three-headed idol of Ganesh in Chyasal. The locality is also famous for its annual sex show, a performance in which the shadows of actors engaged in seduction and love-making are projected onto a white screen, a giggle-fest attended by the entire community, elders and children alike.
Chyasal has four Bhairav shrines in the cardinal directions. Locals believe people residing in the area demarcated by these shrines are immune to acne. The most powerful of the shrines is the one in the south. On a special night in the year, when the god’s power is at its peak, sentries are posted on the alley leading to this shrine to prevent people from seeing the god’s image. Even the priest, who is tasked with covering the god’s face with a sheet of paper, does so with his back turned to it.
Bahals
Bahals are the religious and cultural nerve centres of Patan. These courtyards, adorned with chaityas and sculptures, are where daily life and old allegiances meet and merge. There are more than a dozen of these localities in Patan, not counting the small residential courtyards that abound in the city. Nag Bahal, which lies immediately behind (west) of the Golden Temple, is one of the biggest bahals of Patan. The large Buddha statue in it, with the palm turned southward, reflects the city’s mercantile past. Statues of the Buddha sitting in that posture always had their palms turned southward, a signpost for foreign traders, who would come with trains of porters carrying their goods. Patan’s bahals are bristling with architectural and cultural clues like these, a way to understand the past and invitations to interpret it in a different light. For this reason loitering in a bahal can turn into a scholarly investigation.
Vihars
Patan is one of the oldest Buddhist cities in the world. This aspect of its cultural heritage is evident in the numerous vihars, or monasteries, that are scattered throughout the city. The street going north from the Golden Temple has a couple of old vihars. If you are to visit only one of Patan’s old monasteries, it ought to be Rudra Varna Mahavihar, which is a mere five hundred metres from Darbar Square. It is one of the city’s oldest monasteries, built in the sixth century by the Lichhavi King, Shiva Deva. The monastery’s name, which translates as ‘red face,’ comes from the red-faced statue of Kwapadhya, or Shakyamuni Buddha, which is enshrined in the sanctum.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/patan-modern-storehouse-of-traditions.html,travel
Five reasons why Nepal’s BP Highway is a motorbiker’s paradise,"Wednesday, January 3, 2018","Winter is one of the best times to go out on long drives on Nepal’s highways as the cloud cover over the Himalayas recedes and the clear blue skies can be seen during the day. The season is also well-suited for motorbikers to go on long rides, and the BP Highway that connects Kathmandu with Sindhuli and beyond is one of the best routes for the purpose.
Need more reasons?

Various points on the BP Highway provide great vantage points to look at the majestic mountains and admire their beauty. The snow-capped mountains look even better on starry nights.


The highway passes through many rivers, hills and valleys. All this provides for a great riding experience. The different terrain and the landscape make sure that you do not feel bored during the journey.

The BP Highway’s various sections have ‘floodways’ that make riding exciting. If you are looking for some off-road experience, you could even try riding on the banks of the rivers.

Riding your motorcycle with a group of friends is an experience to savour. If you have like-minded friends, the journey becomes more enjoyable.


Meeting local people and listening to their stories is also an exciting part of the journey. There are numerous settlements along the highway where you can stop and chat with the locals.
The BP Highway is also a gateway to Patale in Solukbhumu district. Why is Patale worth visiting? Well, its the place where you get to see Everest in its full glory!",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/five-reasons-why-nepals-bp-highway-is-a-motorbikers-paradise.html,travel
"Bhaktapur: In the town of devotees, a tourist hub emerges","Monday, January 1, 2018","
It was the large carved wooden window on the façade that made me turn my motorbike around. I didn’t know what the place was—a temple, a pilgrim’s hostel, a residence. I didn’t enter to find out. I just had to see the inside of a building whose front was so artistic.
As I climbed the stone steps to the main entrance I saw an inner courtyard. There was a big oil lamp holder in the middle, unlit, black with soot. Wooden pillars shouldered the weight of two stories. On them, the usual lotus motif. But near their tops were engraved musical instruments: madal and ta, the small brass saucers that when struck together produce the tinkle that punctuates so many Newari devotional hymns. Before I could finish admiring all the pillars a man called to me from the balcony above.
“The goddess is upstairs, brother,” he said, twice, then disappeared. It was cold. I was wearing trekking boots, which take a while to lace up. I had seen the sign at the base of the wooden stairs forbidding people to progress beyond that point wearing shoes. I lingered in the courtyard, but gave in after a while and went up.
The first floor could have been the first floor of any temple anywhere in the Kathmandu Valley: signs of a family occupying a room or two, a vermilion and soot-coated metal donations box, a cluster of bells, niches and a clock on the wall. No amount of temple-hopping could have prepared me for the next sight. Stepping into the inner sanctum was time travel. It was dark save for five or six oil lamps and a couple of lances of sunlight coming in through a latticed window. The floor was a tarry rug of soot and oil. Besides the silence and the darkness, there were the huge masks of the nine goddesses, Nava Durga, staring at you from the wall. I learned about the masks from a woman tending to the goddesses’ shrine. She directed me to the man who had called me upstairs. He told me that electric lights were forbidden in the sanctum. That is why he insisted on donations, he explained. It was to buy oil for the lamps.
I left the temple, head abuzz from being in a place so palpably powerful. I had stumbled into one of Bhaktapur’s gems. I also remembered how on the notice for visitors to take off their shoes at the base of the stairway there was an advertisement for a computer programming institute. That dual reminder – need to go barefoot and a place to learn programming in – is characteristic of the multi-faceted avatar that is Bhaktapur.

Like any ancient city that has managed to salvage its heritage, Bhaktapur is a tourist magnet. To woo tourists it has had to become touristy. However, that layer is thin. Bhaktapur’s uniqueness is its duality: an ancient city within a tourist hub. It’s an ingeniously designed false front of modernism, with a fastness of culture and tradition behind.
For you can be in a frenetic square teeming with tourists, peddlers, worshippers, guides and schoolchildren one minute and the next, wandering down an alley, in a square lined with drying laundry, elderly women basking their tattooed legs in the winter sun, giggling as they twirl out lamp wicks from cotton wool. You ask them something in Nepali and they reply in Newari, then shake their heads to convey that they don’t speak Nepali before bursting into giggles.
The 2015 earthquake was a huge blow to Bhaktapur’s heritage. Darbar Square is being rebuilt, magnificent temples now mere plinths. Concrete, sand, and bricks choke narrow alleys. Entire neighbourhoods are sprouting concrete houses. Doubtless, the sight pains those who remember adobe houses and tiled roofs. At least there is consolation in Bhaktapur. There are still concrete-free neighbourhoods. On a winter’s day, walking around an algae-green pond with a gilded serpent head emerging from its centre, it seems heritage has a chance, a home, here.
A touristy place is as much about sites worth visiting as scenes of enterprising people making a living out of those sites: handicrafts, guided tours, local delicacies. Away from the curio shops and street peddlers, Bhaktapur folk maintain a more languid way of doing business. Like the man selling mustard oil. Canisters hung on either end of the bamboo pole he carried on his shoulders. He went from door to door, singing his way through alleys, his songs melodious utterances of names of Hindu gods. “Jai Kaali! Narayan!” He sat on doorways, pouring out the oil with an old Horlicks glass jar. In another square, as people chatted in the warm winter sun, a man walked by with radishes in a doko: twenty rupees a bunch, leaves still wet with dew, tubers caked with earth. You don’t go vegetable shopping in certain nooks of Bhaktapur; you simply warm yourself in the sun and wait for farmers hauling produce in baskets to walk by.
Bhaktapur’s social fabric is best seen in the winter sun. The coveted warmth brings life – communal life at least – out onto the streets and squares. It’s a fantastic bargain for a visitor: walk and you get a glimpse of the city’s heart. Walk into any alley, nameless and too banal to be on a city guide. Saunter into decrepit courtyards. Examine a dilapidated pati. Every square deserves a look. The further you wander from the famous squares the better. There is a good chance taking a chance will reveal something memorable.
It happened to me recently. I went down a steep alley choked with sand and bricks and arrived at a place where a motor road intersection, a corner of a public square and a shrine converged.
A small group of men, aged early forties to late sixties, was sitting in a ‘U’ formation below a platform that was a Ganesh shrine. A headless goat lay on the flagstone. Two men were cutting a sliver from its neck. Around the blood doused Ganesh statue was a garland of inflated goat intestine, at his feet dozens of eggs dyed in blood. A man performed rituals at the shrine while the group sang, reciting from two yellow-painted manuscripts to the accompaniment of a drum and cymbals. To minds accustomed to concepts of propriety and boundaries, there was a spectacle that blurred everything: a puja done sitting on a road with motorbikes zipping by; devotional songs and blood; a garland of flesh!
Struck by the novelty of the scene (I hadn’t known until then that animals were sacrificed at Ganesh temples) I decided to leave no alley unexplored. I walked an alley parallel to the one I had come down on and arrived at another temple. Its walls were streaked with cracks from the earthquake. No devotional songs, no devotees. Only a Bollywood song played fortissimo, and the whining of an electric saw. Yet in all probability, the wood was being sliced to fashion a beam to renovate the same temple.
After a couple of hours of aimless weaving in and out of Bhaktapur’s sun-deprived alleys and sauntering around its sunny squares, it began to look more and more like a mandala. Not the kind depicted on canvas, crammed with paradisaical scenes of hamlets with pagoda temples scattered along a milky white river flowing out of snowy mountains. Bhaktapur is a febrile mix: medieval and modern, devotional and pop songs, agrarian and touristy, communal and commercial. It is like that temple, glazed bricks and newly carved wooden windows outside; oil-lamps-only sanctum inside.

The religious and secular don’t have boundaries in Bhaktapur. Doorways have shrines above it or at the very least an image or a god’s name hand-painted over lintels. Most homes offer flowers, rice grains and vermilion to the bass relief stone lotuses they have placed on the street directly outside their doors. The sacred is everywhere. And every place also has a functional aspect. It’s a space, to be filled with life. It’s a place to chat with friends, winnow grains, dry radish leaves for making sauerkraut, a place to walk to with your wife of six decades, offering flowers and vermilion to a deity like you have done all your life. It’s where heritage is made human.
While in Bhaktapur

Squares
Squares are almost synonymous with Bhaktapur. Clichéd though it may be, a visit to the three main squares – Darbar, Taumadhi and Dattatreya – is highly recommended. The smart thing to do is not limit yourself to these sites but explore. After taking in the marvel that is the Nyatapola Temple, head south on the main street from Taumadhi Square to watch Bhaktapur’s renowned potters at work in the Potters Square. Head to Dattatreya, the smallest of the three squares, to see what is perhaps the most imitated window design in Nepal: the Peacock Window.
Alleys and Shrines
The entire strip north of Dattatreya Square, running east to west, is a vast treasure trove if you like discovering places rather than have guidebooks select them for you. There are countless comparatively unknown temples, squares and courtyards here.
Siddha Pokhari
This large pond is the perfect anecdote to the kerfuffle of Bhaktapur’s tourist sites. It’s best to leave this for the last part of the day.
Delicacies
Bara
One of the best places to try bara in Bhaktapur is a small eatery on the lane that opens on the north face of the Nyatapola Temple. You will need to look for this place carefully. They don’t have a huge signboard advertising themselves, which is often a sign that the place is famous for its food.
Juju Dhau
Even Kathmandu has shops declaring themselves as the best makers of Juju Dhau, or King of Yogurts. But the best juju dhau, of course, comes from Bhaktapur. Take the alley at the southwestern corner of Dattatreya Square, the one that passes along a sunken bath. You will get to a small shop selling one of the best yogurts in the city.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bhaktapur-in-the-town-of-devotees-a-tourist-hub-emerges.html,travel
Bird watching in Chitwan: Five aves to spot while you are there,"Wednesday, December 6, 2017","
Chitwan is one of the richest areas of Nepal in terms of biodiversity. The area is home to the Chitwan National Park, Nepal’s oldest conservation area, and a designated UNESCO natural heritage site. While elephants, crocodiles, and rhinos receive a lot of attention from visitors, many people going there do not get to experience the bird life.
But the world of birds is equally fascinating. The birds come not only in different colours, but also in different shapes and sizes. Here’s a list of birds you can spot in Chitwan:


The little egret (Egretta garzetta) is a white bird with a slender black beak, long black legs. It mostly lives in water, and eats a variety of small creatures. The bird is commonly seen in wetlands of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. It prefers warm locations and that is why its cousins in Europe migrate to Africa and South Asia for winter.


The Honey buzzard has a long neck with a small head (resembling that of a pigeon) and flies on flat wings. It has a distinct long tail and a short head crest. The sexes of the bird can be easily distinguished. The male is observed to have a blue-grey head, while the female’s head is brown. It is believed to breed in Asia and many members of the species migrate to to Siberia during the summer and come back during the winter.


The darter is mainly a tropical waterbird.  The ‘snakebird’ has a long thin neck that has been compared with a snake. the name ‘darter’ alludes to the way they get their food. It impales fish with its thin, pointed beak. It has a long black tail and in some parts of the world, they are hunted.

The Alexandrine parakeet is named after Alexander the Great, who is credited with exporting this bird from South Asia to European and the Mediterranean. Commonly known as ‘parrot’, the bird is one of the most easy spots in Chitwan.

The hoopoe a colourful bird found in Europe, Africa and Africa. Its distinctive ‘crown’ of feathers sets it apart from other birds in Chitwan. It also has a peculiar cry.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bird-watching-in-chitwan-five-aves-to-spot-while-you-are-there.html,travel
Birds at Shivapuri: Perfect companions on a lazy day,"Monday, December 4, 2017","
Even if you’re not a serious birder, one who goes into forests with binoculars around the neck and a guidebook in hand, the thing you will notice first and foremost when you enter Shivapuri National Park is birds. Some will catch your eye with their brilliant plumage. Others, until they leave their high perches in trees, you will only hear. Within the first few minutes of being inside the park, you will have seen quite a few of the 318 bird species that have been recorded here.
Shivapuri’s importance as a bird habitat and its status as one of Kathmandu’s best bird-watching sites is reflected in the fact that it is one of two Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of Kathmandu (Phoolchoki is the other). Hari Sharan “Kazi” Nepali, a self-taught Nepali ornithologist, fondly remembers Shivapuri as his “school.” It was in this forest that he first began (by playing truant) to study birds. Shivapuri was probably one of the places where Brian Hodgson, the British Resident from 1820-1843, searched for and collected birds to add to his collection.
Ironically, the fact that most species from Hodgson’s time and Nepali’s boyhood survive in Shivapuri today is due to hunting. Shivapuri’s conservation history goes back to the days when it was the private hunting reserve of the ruling elites, especially the Ranas. It also escaped the axe because it was declared a protected area in 1975 under the Shivapuri Watershed Development Board. This step saved an estimated 50 per cent of its forest cover.
Shivapuri is located in a zone between subtropical and temperate climates. This has endowed it with a multitude of habitats within a relatively small area. This explains its extraordinary diversity of birds, 70% of which are residents. It is also an important stop on the migratory route, with some 100 species wintering or resting here before continuing further south. It is home to three restricted-range species: Hoary-throated Barwing, White-throated Tit, and Spiny Babbler, Nepal’s only endemic bird. The slopes of Shivapuri, according to ornithologist Carol Inskipp, are where birders are most likely to spot the rather elusive Spiny Babbler.

Although the Spiny Babbler is what most birders would like to get their eyes on, Shivapuri delights with other species like the Hill Partridge, Yellow-browed Tit, Great Barbet, Wedge-tailed Green Pigeon, Eurasian Jay, Kalij Pheasant, Red-tailed Minla, Nepal Fulvetta, Asian Paradise-flycatcher, Rufous-bellied Woodpecker, Mountain Scops Owl, Speckled Piculet, Rufous-bellied Niltava, White-throated Needletail, Yellow-bellied Bush Warbler, Northern Goshawk, Maroon-backed Accentor, White-tailed Rubythroat and Grey-winged Blackbird. The Nagi Gompa is a great place to spot eagles and, since they often fly pretty low, to photograph them.
A birding trip to Shivapuri provides an opportunity to bridge the gap that has developed between Kathmanduites and birds. It also raises a question: Why have we city-dwellers banished these creatures of vibrant colors, graceful movements and melodious songs from our midst?
Entrance fee
Nepalis: Rs. 60
SAARC nationals: Rs. 300
Others: Rs. 560

Getting there
There are several entry points into the park, but the nearest and most convenient (because of road access) is the one at Pani Muhan, north of Budhanilakantha. To get to Budhanilakantha, head north (toward Gangalal Hospital) from the Narayan Gopal Chok on the Ring Road. Micro buses ply this route, so getting a ride is not a problem. If you are driving up to the park, turn left at the Budhanilakantha Temple, skirt it clockwise, then head up the steep road. If you are on foot, head straight up the road in front of the temple. It’s a 30-minute steep climb to Pani Muhan on foot.
What to take
Carry enough food and water for the hike. There isn’t a shop inside the park. You will be able to refill your bottles at Nagi Gompa though. They also have a canteen; but it’s not always open. Beware of the monkeys at the monastery. They take the opening of food packets at the monastery as their cue to snatch it away. People have been bitten by monkeys there.
Besides birds
Even if there were no birds and no animals in the park, Shivapuri is still a wilderness. The hike up to its summit is one of the best you can have anywhere in the Valley. It’s quite a walk (the peak is nearly three thousand metres high), so give yourself enough time to get there and get back down in daylight. For a more relaxed and less taxing hike, Nagi Gompa is the best option. It’s 3 km from Pani Muhan.
You can also go canyoning (www.canyoninginnepal.com), bouldering, rock climbing and mountain biking in the park.
Bird Conservation Nepal (BCN) is the place to go to if you wish to know more about birds and birding in Shivapuri (www.birdlifenepal.org; 01- 4417805 / 4420213).",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/birds-at-shivapuri-perfect-companions-on-a-lazy-day.html,travel
Why littering the Rara Lake is not so cool,"Thursday, November 16, 2017","
Imagine the stunning beauty of a serene lake situated on the lap of a conifer jungle, interrupted by the green lush of grassland meadows and primitive rhododendron forest. The realm of the pristine wilderness where nature unfolds her beauty to the fullest flowers bloom, fluttering butterflies, buzzing bees or even at the song of warblers.




But all of a sudden, the enchanting aura shatters when the pristine setting is spotted with an exotic mosaic of litters; plastic wrapper, chocolate wrapper, disposable diaper, aluminium cans, glass pieces, tissue paper etc. Such scenarios have become a commonplace sight in popular tourist destinations of Nepal, including the Rara Lake, located inside the Rara National Park in Mugu District of northwestern Nepal.
With road reaching the lake and the number of visitors growing unchecked year after year, Rara’s primitive beauty is in real danger.


Tourists, especially Nepalis, visit the Lake during vacations, especially during the Dashain/Tihar season. More than 200 people on an average day go to the area, where there are just two hotels and a campsite. The need to accommodate such a huge number of individuals within such a small periphery is challenging as well when the majority of them are ‘litter louts’.
Rara Lake is the warehouse of freshwater inhabited by three endemic fish (Schizothoraxsps.) and one endemic frog, Paararica. The lake was enlisted as a Ramsar site in 2007 and supports a variety of life forms. The adjoining landscape of pine-rhododendron forest and grassland patch serves as a critical habitat for musk deer, red panda, Himalayan black bear, brown bear, wild boar and the ancient settlement of Murma village near the outlet, Nijarkhola.


But travel boom in Rara has invited serious problems of litters which shall ultimately diminish the charm of the local environment and bear serious implications to the ecology of Rara Lake and national park in the future. Despite the lake’s periphery trail having rubbish pits with a clear sign that says ‘Phohor Malai’ (Waste Here!), it is easy for anyone to spot man-made litter both around and inside the lake .


Floating plastic and glass bottles lay on the bottom of the sediment. The rising trash in Rara Lake could become a serious issue if appropriate management strategies are not taken on time. It takes 15 years for a plastic bag, 50 years for an aluminium can, 450 years for a disposable diaper, million years for a glass bottle to decompose.
The more such trash left out in remotely-accessed natural areas, the more will it impact the local environment, flora and fauna.


Rara National Park does not permit activities that will harm natural habitat, local resource and biodiversity. You will find a list of dos and don’ts that need to be considered carefully whenever you are visiting a protected area.
In fact, it is the duty of every one to adhere to the rules and regulations so that we do not hamper the existence of our natural resources through our own actions. Visitors must understand that Rara Lake falls inside the core area of Rara National Park and their activities should not be like in the buffer area.
It is high time that Rara National Park prepared its separate independent guidelines to protect the local region. Maintaining a trade-off between the pressures of litterbug visitors and preserving the local environment is indeed a challenging issue for the national park. Restricting the number of visitors, the addition of entry/check posts, strengthening environmental awareness campaign, training on 3R, plastic-free zone declaration and strict measures for litter louts should be on the priority list for the management of Rara Lake in the upcoming days.

Tour de Lomanthang: This is how your trip to Upper Mustang is getting easy now,"Friday, October 27, 2017","
The road to Upper Mustang looks really amazing: on both sides are desert-looking plain lands; some sections of the road are recently blacktopped; and there are very few vehicles to give to a maximum sense of freedom to the rider.
The construction and upgrading of road have caused a surge in the number of domestic tourists visiting this serenely beautiful piece of Himalayan Nepal.

Of course, in past few years, the number of visitors to Upper Mustang has significantly increased. But, tourism entrepreneurs are not satisfied for they want as many Nepalis as possible to visit this region as it gives them a unique understanding of their own country.
This is why the Tour de Lomanthang tour package has been introduced.

Chhiring Phunsok Thakuri, Managing Director of the Ozone Expedition Nepal Private Limited, the company which introduced the package, says his company targets those who have a keen desire to visit Mustang, but do not have sufficient time to trek, The company provides motorcycles and jeeps to ride to major attractions of Upper Mustang including Lomanthang, Korala Pass and Muktinath Temple.

Besides planing and arranging the trip from either Kathmandu or Pokhara, the company also provides preventive measures and basic treatment against altitude sickness and coordinates for helicopter rescue for severe cases.
“Of course, the journey is tough, but it is equally adventurous and we need to enjoy it to the fullest.”

"At Nepal’s western frontier, wilderness beckons","Sunday, October 22, 2017","Nepal’s Far-West dazzles with many natural and cultural attractions. But these attractions have failed to draw tourists from far and wide for want of publicity. Here we look at must-visit areas of Nepal’s western frontier.

Bardiya
Naya Muluk, or ‘new country,’ the Ranas called what are today the districts of Kanchanpur, Kailali, Banke and Bardiya. The British returned this swath of Tarai jungle, which they had won after the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814, to Nepal as a gesture of gratitude to Jung Bahadur Rana for his assistance in quelling the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. From 1814 till the return of the territory, the British had only extracted timber from Kanchanpur and Kailali; Banke and Bardiya’s jungles were spared.

Too far from Kathmandu and with next to no importance politically, Bardiya remained a backwater until the mid-1950s when malaria was curbed enough to encourage the hill-dwelling populace to settle the Tarai. Up until then, so the saying went, those from the hills could not survive a year in the malarial lowlands. People descended from the hills in a giant wave, like the flashfloods that hurtle down in the monsoons. Naya Muluk became the new home for thousands of axe-wielding, forest-clearing, land-hungry families. Populations grew, forests vanished.
If Bardiya hadn’t been declared a protected area in the mid-seventies, Tarai jungles would have survived only in old tales. The 968 square kilometers of Bardiya National Park is what remains of that unforgiving wilderness. It’s still a wild world, untamed and inhospitable, home to some of the most magnificent and ferocious animals.
‘Bardiya’ means ‘herder’ in Tharu—an allusion to this indigenous people’s practice of animal husbandry on the edges of the immense forests. Today, Tharus no longer can take their animals to the forests nor can they move freely in and out of them like they used to for extracting raw materials from which they fashioned utensils, ropes, roofing and countless other household items. Some old houses, and old ways of life, still survive along the park. One such place is Thakurdwara, a village contiguous to the national park.
Thakurdwara is a mixture of long, single-storey adobe huts with thatched roofs and large resorts catering to tourists. It’s a human habitation on the edge of animal haven. The border between the wilderness and the village is a porous one as far as the animals are concerned. Unrestricted by visiting hours or permits and unable to resist the ripening crops, wild elephants often cross over to raid fields of rice or sugarcane. This has resulted in a conspicuous architectural structure—machan, a wooden tower where anxious farmers keep vigils, armed with metal pots and pans and the occasional muzzle-loader to scare away pachyderms and other animals on the lookout for an easy meal.
Being in Bardiya, even when you are not in the national park and virgin forests is a sharing of space with animals. One time, while I was brushing my teeth before bed, I heard a squeal and thrashing in the bougainvillaea bush outside the bathroom window of my cottage. I shone a flashlight into it and saw a bushy, ringed tail. Following the tail upward I found a mouse dangling from the mouth of a civet. I went to bed and lay down as the civet crunched on the bones. On some mornings I woke to the call of a jungle rooster sauntering on the resort’s lawn.
Tharus, the indigenous inhabitants of Bardiya and much of Nepal’s western Tarai, are an equally fascinating lot. Their traditional way of life makes eco-tourism sound like a joke: the Tharu way of life, now dying out, was a manual on living with nature. They depended on nature’s bounty, in their case the jungles and the rivers and the grasslands, without ever exploiting it.
In an age where old ways of life have either gone or are on the verge of disappearance, it’s a bit foolish to expect to find Tharus living like they did fifty years ago. But it is the rarity that now adds to the beauty of Tharu culture. It’s a delight to come across an old Tharu woman, her septum limp from years of bearing the weight of her nose ring, immersed up to her neck in a stream, a small pear-shaped wicker basket on her head, gliding through like an otter, spooking fish and crabs into the net she is dragging along the bottom. Sometimes there are little girls, probably her granddaughters, following in her wake with their own fishing nets and baskets. In the water culture itself made fluid, flowing from one generation to another, as granny and the children glide upstream, the kids squealing in delight as a fish breaks the surface.

However different a Tharu village might be to a place you are familiar with, it is nevertheless homely, welcoming, reassuring. Your entry permits into Bardiya’s jungle proper on the other hand is akin to signing a document forfeiting comforts, bodily and mental. There is the vivacity of countless life forms, enormous trees and tiny birds, tranquility and excitement—almost everything that cities have lost. You might also see a tiger or a herd of elephants or any of Bardiya’s other mammals, which include the rhino, Asiatic wild dog, blue bull. A sudden whirring overhead may turn out to be a flock of giant hornbills, or you might spot any of 426 species of birds found in Bardiya. Luck might bestow on you a smooth-coated river otter sighting. Or you may see nothing at all after sitting for hours in a shady patch on the banks a river.
Side Trips
Blackbucks: If you’ve made the long way west to Thakurdwara, it’s worth visiting a couple of places near there. One is the Blackbuck Conservation Area. This 488-hectare patch of grassland is home to the northernmost population of blackbucks in the world. Living close to humans has given the antelopes here a nonchalance that will be relished by camera wielders of all stripes, from professional photographers to selfie buffs.
Crocodiles: Get closer to crocodile than you ever can (or would wish to) at the national park’s crocodile breeding centre. From puny gharial babies sunning themselves to giants who have fathered or birthed them to stare downs with mugger crocodiles that unsettle even with a fence in between, this is a showcase of Bardiya’s reptilian gems.
Tharu Museum: In case you don’t get to see Tharus in their traditional attire, doing what their forefathers did or get the chance to visit a traditional Tharu home, there is the Tharu Museum near the entrance to the park. It’s a thorough replica of a Tharu home, down to their altars and grain containers.
Further west: If you plan to travel west from Bardiya, stop at the Ghodaghodi Tal. Situated right next to the East-West Highway, this lotus-covered lake is a haven for mugger crocodiles and birds including cormorants, jacunas and eagles. Keep well away from the water: there have been instances of crocodile attacks on people.
Bardiya National Park in Numbers
AREA: 968 sq km—largest protected area in Nepal’s lowlands.
ESTABLISHED: In 1976, a small area given protected area status, named Royal Karnali Wildlife Reserve. Renamed Bardiya Wildlife Reserve in 1982. Park’s area expanded in 1984, declared Bardiya National Park.
VEGETATION: Sal forests, phanta (grasslands), and riverine forests.
MAMMALS: Royal Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, blue bull, blackbuck.
BIRDS: A total of 426 species, including great hornbill, sarus crane, Bengal florican, lesser florican, black-bellied tern, Pallas’s fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, painted stork, black-necked stork, and lesser adjutant.
IN AND BY THE RIVERS: Ganges river dolphin, mugger crocodile, gharial, smooth-coated otter, golden mahseer.
DISTANCE FROM KATHMANDU: 550 km
Khaptad
If paradise is a place of natural beauty that does not change at all or changes little over time, Khaptad National Park in Nepal’s Far-Western Development Region is one. An ascetic arrived there in the mid-1940s and, struck by the place’s wildness and isolation settled down to search for the Ultimate Truth. Khaptad is still that wild, almost that isolated.
Perhaps paradise is a handful of people in an immense wilderness. If so, Khaptad is one. The wilderness is a 225 sq km mesh of 11 types of trees and dozens of patan, hillocks that are green, alpine flower-carpeted mounds, like stupas without spires. The permanent population of Khaptad – a Nepal Army company and some park employees – is under 100. The army barracks and the national park office buildings occupy one corner of a hill, an island in the midst of an ocean of wilderness. Walking half a kilometre in any direction from them is like setting sail into another world, where encountering another person is a rarity. Cell phone reception is available on a hilltop, an inconvenience that makes it more convenient not to call. Even getting into Khaptad is not easy. The road that connects the trailhead at Jhigrana to Silgadi gets washed out every monsoon, limiting traffic and hence tourist numbers.
Being in Khaptad is like being in one of those spiritual retreats where they strip you off of everything that you might use to pass time. You are reduced to yourself and your surroundings, with an occasional small talk with the major or the warden or any of the soldiers and park employees. To make use of your solitude (or to get rid of its chafing effect) you walk in the ageless forests, finding leopard pugmarks, spooking blood pheasants, flushing pikas out of their burrows, and wondering every twenty minutes or so, how could someone live here for fifty years? That is how long the ascetic who stumbled upon Khaptad spent there, eventually becoming known as Khaptad Baba.
It’s hard to know why someone lives alone in a place for five decades. The easy answer is that Khaptad is a beautiful place, but beauty’s hold is fickle. Like any truly wild place, Khaptad’s charm hits home much later, perhaps when you are stuck in traffic and you pine for that emptiness and silence of Khaptad’s meadows.

Khaptad National Park in Numbers
AREA: 225 sq km
ESTABLISHED: 1984
FLORA: 567 species (estimated), of which nearly 400 are listed; 125 of them are medicinal plants, 50 are poisonous.
MAMMALS: 23 species of mammals recorded, including musk deer, leopard cat, grey wolf, Asiatic black bear, Asiatic wild dog, yellow-throated marten, pika.
BIRDS: 287 species of birds, including Impeyan Pheasant (Nepal’s national bird), blood and cheer pheasants, white-rumped vulture.
NEW TO SCIENCE: In 1996, the Khaptad Pelobatig Toad (scutiger nipalensis), was discovered in Khaptad.
ENDEMIC FROG: Bajhang Frog (paa ercepeae) is endemic to Khaptad.
MUST SEE: The postcard-perfect Ghodadauney Patan, the tranquil Khaptad Daha with its old shrines, the views of Api and Saipal ranges, Sahasralinga shrine, also the highest point in the park (3,300 m).



There are daily flights from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj. Thakurdwara is almost 90 km from Nepalgunj. Local buses run between Nepalgunj and Ambassa. From Ambassa, you can get rides to Thakurdwara on buses or jeeps. Overnight buses ply the route between the capital and Bardiya. Buses also run for the enchanting wilderness from Pokhara and Chitwan.

The quicker option is to fly to Dhangadhi, then go by road to Silgadi and begin your trek from there. Or, if the road is in good condition, take jeeps from Silgadi to Jhigrana, the entry point into Khaptad National Park. It is recommended that you walk from Silgadi to Jhigrana. This will get your body in trekking mode, which is crucial because the section from Jhigrana is as steep as it gets. It’s not a trail to take on straight after being in a vehicle for hours.
Overnight buses running from Kathmandu to Dhangadhi will deposit you at Attariya, from where you can get buses or microbuses to Silgadi.

Packing for Khaptad
Khaptad still lacks creature comforts that are now becoming common in even remote villages. Like hotels or lodges. Khaptad still doesn’t have one, although there is going to be one soon. The Army barracks and the park employee quarters are the only places that can offer shelter, so unless you know an uncle who knows a general in the army or is the cousin of the warden, take a tent and sleeping bag. Warm clothes are a must (no such thing as summer in Khaptad). Carry plenty of food, though be mindful of stowing it away from your tent if you’re sleeping near the forest (enough bears around to catch a whiff of your noodles). Best time to visit Khaptad is between March and May or October and November.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/at-nepals-western-frontier-wilderness-beckons.html,travel
"Bungamati: Temples have crumbled, faith survives in this Newar town","Wednesday, October 4, 2017","
Discover an ancient Newar town free from the cultural degradation that has been affecting some big cities in Nepal
The road to Bungamati is not your everyday commute. Moreover, when you decide to pedal your way to the ancient town, the first uphill from Bhainsepati will make you gasp for breath. Once you make it to the top, the view, believe me, will compensate for the arduous climb.
From there, take a right and the trail will take you for a downhill ride to a temple Karyabinayak. Keep on riding for another five minutes on a rocky trail to reach the hamlet near Bungamati. If you get there before dawn, you get to see locals waiting in line to fill their buckets.
When you enter the square of the Rato Machhindranath Templem you see conjoined houses, some still standing, others barely. At the square, you also see wooden materials, shattered bricks and stones from the rubble of the houses that could not stand the devastating earthquake two years ago.
The township has had an intricate relationship with its god Machhindranath, whose temple stood gloriously at the heart of the settlement. The temple has now been reduced to ruins, but faith lives on. At one corner, men play their usual bhajans extolling the divine.
This is the place to be in early morning as you see a lot of happy faces, despite the sorrow the quake inflicted on the town. You do not get fancy places to eat around the temple but a quick chana–anda can temporarily help you forget your hunger.
Take a stroll around the temple square, and you get to see life in almost all its hues. There is a grandmother bringing her grandchildren for a walk, and there are hawkers selling fresh vegetables brought directly from their fields.
As the sun becomes more powerful, locals get busy with their daily chores while making time to share their usual conversations. Stray dogs and cattle run in loops looking for food.
Parched on elevated land, Bungamati has been a hub for woodcarvers and farmers from times immemorial. The main source of income for most people there is wood-carving. At every stop in the town, you see people making carve for windows and doors for temples destroyed during the quake.
Despite the toll the earthquake took on the people here, there are signs of hope and inspiration. Undeterred by the disaster, people have gone back to their hammer and chisel. The optimism of the people here is what will mesmerise you.

The festival of Rato Machhindranath is the most important and exciting time of the year for the people of Bungamati.
It is believed that Rato Machhindranath, when brought to Bungamati, blessed Kathmandu with rainfall when it was experiencing the worst drought in its history. From then on, the idol of Rato Machhindranath, which is housed at the main temple in Bungamati, is taken to different places of Patan on a chariot.
Close to Bungamati is another small traditional Newar village, Khokana. This Newari village is filled with stone-paved streets and traditional houses, a paradise for the shutterbugs.

Every sight you see in Khokana, you want to capture it in your camera.
While you’re at Bungamati, don’t miss the opportunity to visit Khokana as well.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bungamati-temples-have-crumbled-faith-survives-in-this-newar-town.html,travel
Glimpses of Gokyo: On the foothills of the world’s roof,"Tuesday, September 26, 2017","
For thousands of people in the world, the only thing they know about Nepal is that it is the home to Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Hence, they fail to realise that Nepal boasts many other travel destinations which are as enticing as the Everest.

One is the Gokyo Lake, which lies just at the foothill of Everest, at an altitude of 5,360 metres. Pictures of the Lake and areas surrounding it were exhibited at the Nepal Tourism Board in Kathmandu from September 22 to 26.

Total 33 photographs captured by photographer Dawa Lama attracted hundreds of visitors at the latest edition of #PhotoNepal hosted by the NTB.

“You can enjoy the masmerising views of Sagarmatha, Makalu, Cho-Oyu, Lhotse and other mountains from the Gokyo Lake. Further, it is a part of trekking route in itself,” NTB Executive Chief Deepak Raj Joshi says, “Hence, we exhibited pictures from the site.”

Meanwhile, photographer Lama says suggests this season before the winter, and between greatest Nepali festivals of Dashain and Tihar, will be the best for any visitor wishing to visit Gokyo.

It takes three days to reach the lake from Namche Bazaar.

Trip to Gadhimai: A profound experience evoking awe and wonder,"Tuesday, September 26, 2017","
The year: 2014. The day: November 24.
Despite a massive global media furor and campaigns including stage protests, impassioned pleas, urgent petitioning, vocal dissents and vehement denunciations–the day marked the beginning of a month-long—the ‘largest’, ‘bloodiest’, ‘cruelest’, ‘goriest’, and ‘most barbaric’ animal sacrifice in the world at a Hindu shrine called Gadhimai in a small nondescript village called Bariyarpur in Bara district, 150 km southeast of Kathmandu.
This ritualistic mass slaughter of animals was carried out to supposedly propitiate the Gadhimai Goddess Bhagwati for more than two and a half centuries (almost 265 years). In 2009 alone, tens of thousands of animals (an estimated 500,000 animals) including buffaloes, goats, chickens, ducks, pigeons and others were sacrificed.
In late July, 2015, the world seemed to suddenly fall silent …and … relieved, when a news, “Victory! Animal Sacrifice Banned at Nepal’s Gadhimai Festival, Half a Million Animals Saved”, a press release from Humane Society International (HSI) and Animal Welfare Network Nepal (AWNN) hogged the headlines in papers.
“We have decided to completely stop the practice of animal sacrifice,” was the statement made by Motilal Prasad, secretary of the Gadhimai Temple Trust, which organises the celebrations.
In 2013, my wife and I on a visit to Birgunj decided to make a trip to the famed Gadhimai temple located some 21-22km east of the bustling border town. We started early in the morning.
As we left Birgunj, the city seemed to gear up for the hectic day ahead. Whiffs of cooking wafted in through our car window. People crowded the teahouses for nasta (breakfast) as shopkeepers ladled out golden crisp jalebis on trays from huge karais (iron saucepans) at their shop fronts. A typical Terai teahouse morning nasta includes hot puris(fried flat bread), jalebis (sweets), potato curry and sweet tea–my favourite.
As we drove due east, miles after staggering miles of endless cultivated land stretched out, as far as we could see. And the smell – there was no mistaking the typical Terai hallmark—the strong odour of burning dead leaves and dung-cakes, followed by a pungent aroma of molasses.
Clusters of tiny farmsteads and clumps of mangos, the evergreen jamun and coconut trees dotted the distant fields. Mixed roadside settlements: ramshackle mud-and-thatch huts, improved brick houses, and makeshift lean-tos serving as shops and tea houses, flanked the highway on two sides.
Trundling bullock carts, piled high with hay, tractors plowing the distant fields, women going about their ways loads balanced on their head, men and women alike pedalling along on their bicycles, and the far-off intermittent hooting sound from a rice mill blended in to complete the Terai landscape. Radhika, my wife, was especially amused by the sight of so many men in dhotis, a rarity in Kathmandu.

After travelling 13 km, we arrived in the bustling town of Kalaiya. The traffic crawled as we weaved through the congestion. While people milled about the haphazard clutter of shops, hawkers peddled their wares amid blaring loudspeakers belting out Hindi cinema tunes.
Motorcycles zipped past, and bicycles danced by and the tangas (horse-drawn two-wheeled vehicle) squeezed through – too close for comfort. I almost rammed into an ox-cart that suddenly appeared from nowhere. Adding more incongruity to the situation, doleful looking buffaloes squatted on the main street, masticating indifferently to the frenetic activity around them.

After kicking up dust across an 8-km dirt road, we finally arrived in Bariyarpur – one of countless impoverished villages in the Nepali Tarai. Soon, we were at the Gadhimai temple complex. A long row of lean-tos selling puja items lined the entrance lane. A flight of steps led to a large fore-court laid with noticeably clean flagstones.
Two small brightly painted pagoda styled temples stood side by side while banyan and pipal trees stood sentinels with their huge outstretched branches.  Lucky for us, the post-Dashain time had not drawn a big crowd—and the main pujari (priest), Shiva Chaudhary Tharu, was readily available.
Soon, our puja began at the first temple. Completely bare of idols, a trident, said to be the spot where Gadhimai took up her residence first in Bariyarpur, stood beside a big stone (used for breaking coconuts).
The next temple housed the Gadhimai’s incarnate form. Inside the narrow interior, a well-carved polished jet-black stone idol of Gadhimai under the extended hood of a stone shesh-nag (a thousand-headed cobra) stood on a red lotus. Smothered in vermilion, and donning a red blouse, red sari, red shawl embroidered with a golden floral motif, the goddess sported a crown, nose ring, earrings, gold bangles and silver anklets.
If the Goddess’s one hand held a khadga (scimitar), the other carried a bajra (thunderbolt, symbolising a weapon used by Hindu deities). What were most striking were her eyes, large and cast in silver. Also venerated as Bhagwati Shree Gadhimai, the shrine is united with shakti peeths (holy places of cosmic powers). With a little pushing and shoving and the cracking of a coconut, our puja (worship ritual) sans the animal sacrifice (my wife and I do not observe animal sacrifice) was over.
Next, the chief pujari (priest),  Chaudhary showed us around the temple complex. A big pond boasted the west of the temple where the devotees took a dip before their puja. The worshippers made it a point to pay homage to the Baba Kaleswornath temple and the Janginut deity located at two corners of the pond, the latter said to be Gadhimai’s sentinel.
Back at the temple, we observed people collecting soil from the bed of a tree. “Blessed by the Gadhimai, the soil from these tree beds is considered sacred, which if sprinkled in the fields enriches fertility of the land,” said Chaudhary. People also took the soil to sprinkle it in the foundation of their new houses.

It is no surprise that every shrine in Nepal is shrouded in ancient myths, legends and religious beliefs. Gadhimai’s mystical history dates back some 900 years to a simple god-fearing and benevolent resident of Bariyarpur, named Bhagwan Chaudhary.
The story goes thus: One day a theft took place at Bhagwan Choudhary’s house, but the thieves were caught red-handed and paid with their lives at the hands of the enraged villagers. Fearing that his fellow villagers would be convicted, Bhagwan Chaudhary took the blame himself and was sent to Nakkhu jail in Kathmandu.
One night, the goddess of Makawanpur Gadhi appeared in his dream and kept appearing on subsequent nights asking her to take him to Bariyarpur and the scene of the crime. The goddess’s occult powers freed Bhagwan Chaudhary from the jailhouse, and a pinch of soil from her feet to his turban enabled him a free passage back to his village.
In return, Gadhimai asked him to sacrifice five humans each year. Bhagwan Chaudhary magnanimously offered his own life, saying he would be unable to perform human sacrifice. Instead he vowed an animal pancha bali (a quintuple sacrifice) every five years. It would include a rat, a pig, a rooster, a goat and a water buffalo.
And thus began the tradition of an animal pancha bali to appease Gadhimai, the goddess of power and prosperity, and a guardian against evil. This ritual failed, however, as children and youngsters of Bariyarpur suddenly took ill and started dying.
Bhagwan Chaudhary again made an appeal to Gadhimai and was directed by the goddess to offer a human sacrifice along with the pancha bali. The hunt began for a human, but to no avail. Fortunately, a villager from Simri from neighbouring Rautahat district came to the rescue and instead of his life, offered as sacrifice, shedding of five drops of blood from his body—the chest, tongue, lower part of eye, thigh and arm. Miraculously, that averted the calamity.
“This ritual is practiced at every five-yearly mela (fair),” said Chaudhary as he wound up his brief history of Gadhimai.
Chaudhary, a direct descendant of Bhagwan Chaudhary, has also authored a booklet on Gadhimai in Hindi. In fact, the positions of chief priest and others at Gadhimai are all hereditary, passed on to the descendants of Bhagwan Chaudhary.
“Every five years, Bariyarpur buzzes from dawn till dusk for an entire month. The turnout of devotees is massive. It crosses the five million mark, out of which almost 75 per cent belong to bordering towns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India,” a local, Manoj Chaudhary, informed me.
Like a river in spate, a constant stream of people keep pouring in, pushing and shoving here, there and everywhere with hardly any elbow room. Devotees in hordes are seen camping out in the open with their kitchens set outdoors. Makeshift stalls by the hundreds are squeezed together around the temple grounds occupying every inch of empty space available.
From sugary sweets to bangles, puja items to local souvenirs, the shops and eateries do brisk business and the festive atmosphere resonates with blaring loudspeakers playing Hindi bhajans.
Next, and with a tremendous sense of awe, we visited the site where the massive sacrifices were carried out. According to the Hindu lunar calendar, on the second Saptami of Mangsir (second or third week of November), the seventh day of the full moon, the chief priest offers puja to Gadhimai at the Bramha Baba shrine located under a huge pipal tree.
A ghee-lamp spontaneously and miraculously lights itself, the miracle said to be brought about by Gadhimai’s visit to this shrine, where the goddess resides all through the month-long mela. The narabali (human sacrifice) of five drops of human blood and the animal pancha bali is initiated. The mass sacrificial ritual follows, carried out in a walled-in ground near the temple. Only licensed persons designated by the mela committee carry out the sacrifice.
The lamp goes off on its own on the day the mela ends and Gadhimai returns to her usual place. The bali (sacrifice) is halted immediately and the remaining buffaloes are herded off earmarked for the next mela with the tips of their ears chopped off.
Save for some stray donkeys grazing on the lush grass, the sacrificial ground (walled with an area of 1 bigha), which becomes a seething mass of slaughtered animals on the day the festival begins, wore a deserted look. I stood there trying to visualise the gory scene when men wielding swords and machetes decapitated the buffaloes … in thousands.
For my wife and me, the Gadhimai pilgrimage was a profound experience, evoking awe, wonder and a mix of emotions. There was a certain mystique about the shrine – its overpowering presence, history, and above all its timeless religious practice and tradition.

Mustang is welcoming more Nepalis than ever,"Friday, September 8, 2017","
This was the fifth time I was in the ancient settlement of Mustang.
But every time I go there, I get a feeling of something new. This time it was the tourists, who were there to enjoy the rich culture and splendid natural beauty of the place. During my previous visits, I had not seen domestic tourists roam the alleys of Mustang in such numbers. It was only foreign tourists who would be seen there.

I came to a conclusion that this happened for two reasons. First, it is easier to reach Mustang by road than ever before, and more Nepalis can afford to do that compared to air travel. The second is related to an initiative of which the Nepal Tourism Board is also a partner. We have supported the locals to establish a homestay facility in Thini at the heart of Mustang.

By looking at the number of domestic tourists visiting Mustang, one is left wondering: if only we could further improve the road access to the region. Only the Kagbeni-Muktiunath section of the highway to Mustang has been tarmacked and the rest of the section has been dug to widen the lanes. But work is slow.
Once the road improves, it is certain that more Nepalis would want to head to Mustang, bringing in much-needed vitality to the local economy.
Mustang is not just about landscapes. It is also about culture and history. We hope that as more Nepalis come to stay in Thini, they will understand this.

"Ahead of the new climbing season, meet Nepal’s eight-thousanders","Sunday, August 27, 2017","
In the West, whenever there’s talk of Nepal, people think about the Himalayas and the snow. For many, Nepal has become synonymous with the Himalayas. Those living outside Nepal, sometimes, fail to gauge the enormity of the mountains, and ask Nepalis they meet, “Have you climbed Everest?”
But Nepal is not just home to Everest, the highest mountain in the word. Eight of the ten tallest peaks in the world are in Nepal. As climbers around the world prepare for the autumn season of mountaineering in the Himalayas, here’s a look at the ‘Eight Thousanders’ in Nepal.
Everest

The 8,848m tall mountain is the highest peak in the world. It was on May 29, 1953 that Hilllary and Norgay reached the summit of Everest. The mountain has a special place in the deeply religious Nepali and Tibetan communities. As the mountain is shared between Nepal and China, it can be climbed from the north and the south. But experienced alpinists prefer the climb from the Nepal side.
Kanchenjunga

It is the third-highest mountain in the world and is 8,586m tall. It is located in Nepal’s Taplejung district. It was on May 25, 1955 that humans first set foot on the summit.
Lhotse
The fourth-tallest mountain, which is a part of the Mahalangur mountain range, stands majestically at 8,531m . It is located in Nepal’s Solukhumbu district.
Makalu

Fifth on the list of the tallest mountains in the world, Makalu stands tall at 8,463 metres. Tourism experts say trek around the mountain has a lot of potential, but because of its remoteness, it doesn’t attract many thrill seekers.
Choyu
The sixth tallest mountain in the world is 8,2100 m high. It is also located in Solukhumbu. The first successful expedition to the mountain took place in October 1954.
Dhaulagiri

Dhaulagiri is one of the most famous mountains in the world of mountaineering. It is located between Manang and Mustang districts of Nepal. Visitors to the Annapurna trail also get to the see the mountain up close on their way to the base camp.
Manaslu

The eighth tallest mountain in the world is located in Nepal’s Gorkha. The trail around the mountain is one of the most famous in the world. Humans first set foot on the peak on May 1, 1956. It is 8,163m  tall.
Annapurna

Although Annapurna is the tenth tallest mountain in the world, it has a higher ranking among mountaineering enthusiasts around the world. The Annapurna trail is one of the most famous trails in the world. It is 8,091m above the sea level.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/ahead-of-the-new-climbing-season-meet-nepals-eight-thousanders.html,travel
Travelling in Nepal alone: 9 tips for solo adventure-seekers,"Tuesday, August 22, 2017","Traveling solo is quite easy in Nepal, though being alone means you need to be prepared for whatever comes your way, which is a lot. Here are some tips, most learned the hard way, on making your solo trips enjoyable or, if faced with some problem, making them bearable.
Don’t let it get to your head

I’ve spent a night shuddering in the cold in the Godavari forest because my friends and I decided to take a shortcut. It’s better to arrive late than to spend a night on a rock in the jungle.
Grill passersby

Ask questions about the trail, the weather, accommodations and whatever you need to know but don’t about the place you are headed. Two things will happen: you’ll get wonderful information, and you might make friends or strike up memorable conversations, like that one time a foreigner asked me why Ganesh, the god of good fortune, had had his head chopped off.
Always ask the lodge owners if they have a rule that requires you to eat at the lodge

In some places in Nepal, this is a stringent rule. Not something that you will be fined for, but it’s always better to avoid unpleasant situation with the owners.

Carry your own food

Assuming you are traveling by bus or microbus, your meals will be in eateries where the driver decides to stop. These places seldom offer good food. It’s best to carry your own food. There will be amazing food sometimes in places you never imagined could serve a proper meal, but there are a dozen of bowel-shattering meals on Nepal’s highway for every such golden meal.
Don’t assume that prices will be reasonable

You will be shocked – and consequently robbed – in some places in Nepal, especially the highways settlements, if you neglect to ask the price of a dish before you dig into it. The rates in these places, chosen for you by the bus you’re traveling in, are sky-high compared to the quality they offer. It’s not the norm, but what is there to do after the food is in your stomach and the proprietor demands an improper fee?
Where you sit matters

I once took the seat next to the door in an overnight bus from Pokhara to Bardiya. It was winter. The door’s hinges had gotten loose, so I spent the night shuddering. Conversely, it would be a seat to die for if you’re travelling in summer. Avoid the back seats on long-distance buses. Not only will you be bouncing up and down every time the bus hits a pothole, those seats also tend to be a favourite of drunks. They tend to invite themselves onto the shoulders of fellow-passengers. So avoid it unless you want to babysit a boozed adult.
Dress up for the ride

Buses in Nepal – the ordinary ones, adorned with ticket collectors hanging out the doors – quickly turn into ice chambers in the winter time. It’s better to wear more than less.
Prepare for shocks

If you travel enough in Nepal, you will soon know that more often than not you will end up spending more time on the road than you planned. If you’re lucky you’ll be stuck near a settlement. But you just might as easily find yourself waiting in the middle of nowhere. Be prepared for such delays and carry ample snacks and drinking water.
Cradle your expensive stuff

On my last bus trip out of Kathmandu, three people had their laptops stolen when the bus stopped for a bathroom break. They had all made the cardinal mistake of leaving their valuables in the bus when they got off to relieve themselves. It’s unfair to portray Nepali buses as the haunts of thieves, but it’s unwise to assume that your fellow passengers are a flock of saints.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/travelling-in-nepal-alone-9-tips-for-solo-adventure-seekers-need.html,travel
Tripura Sundari: The goddess of the rugged hills,"Tuesday, August 8, 2017","
Dolpa is home to perhaps one of the most rugged terrain the country, where people lead a life different from the rest of the country. The hills make constructing roads difficult and building communication infrastructure cumbersome.

But that does not deter people from living in the land of their ancestors, especially when the gods are there to protect them.

One such famous goddess is Tripura Sundari, believed to be an incarnation of Durga herself.
According to legends, a king named Bikram Shahi ruled over the area and where the temple now stands stood his palace. When an excavation of the palace was later carried out, a butterfly came out from the earth and ‘stayed’ on a mound, where the temple was built.


The temple, which is also called Bala Tripura Sundari, receives thousands of visitors from around the country during the Dashain festival.

The temple is not as grand as those in different cities around Nepal, but for the the devout, this does not matter.

The devi is believed to have magical powers and fulfill the wishes of the worshipers.

The temple has become an oasis for travellers venturing into western Nepal. However, much remains to be done to promote the area as a tourist destination given the difficult terrain, a blessing as well as a a curse for the region.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tripura-sundari-the-goddess-of-the-rugged-hills.html,travel
Tracking down the nocturnal marauders of Bhirkot,"Wednesday, August 2, 2017","
For close to four hours I had crouched on the machan with a shotgun on my lap and a flashlight in my hand, keeping the night vigil for my quarry–the wild boar.
I got more and more uncomfortable with each passing minute. The late July night after the rains was relatively cool; but, to my great misery, the mosquitoes were out in force and my skin crawled at the thought of the leeches around my ankles, gorging themselves on my blood.
“Ho ho, ha, ha,” the ear-piercing hoarse cry suddenly ripped the stillness of the night, followed by a loud beating of tin cans–the sound bouncing off the hillside.
The noise jerked me wide awake. Instinctively I grabbed for the gun, my heart in my mouth. In the frantic lunge, the flashlight slipped and I swore under my breath.
Groping in the darkness, I found it lying on the floor of the machan, my lookout post several feet up from the ground. I waited with bated breath for something to happen but soon a deathly hush descended over the night.
The silence was then broken as a barn owl hooted nearby, the screeching sound lending more eeriness to the dark night. I learned in the morning that the nighttime racket made by the villagers was intended to drive away the wild boar from the corn fields.
The wild boar hunt for me and my two partners was more of a mission than an outing. The location was Bhirkot, a small village just 12 kilometres from the heart of Kathmandu. The year was 1990.
We were supposed to shoot the wild boars that were destroying the villagers’ crops.
I had never heard of Bhirkot until one day Ramesh, my shooting companion and a doctor, told me about it. He had a patient from Bhirkot who bemoaned the havoc wreaked by wild boar in his village.
That was all the enticement we needed. Hunting fanatics that we were, we set off for Bhirkot the following weekend, intent on remedying the issue. Nirmal, our third companion joined us at the last moment.
Barely a half-hour ride on our motorbikes west of Sitapaila to Ramkot, then a 45 minute hike uphill to the north, Bhirkot was a cluster of 30 to 40 houses scattered amidst terraced fields on a hillside.
A stunning view of the Kathmandu Valley dominated the southeast and the towering ridge of the Nagarjun Forest Reserve, a haven for wild boar, flanked the north. The landscape west of the village stretched into the forested hills of Bhimdhunga.
Once at the village, Govinda, our host and Ramesh’s patient, over a cup of tea, assured us that it was okay to shoot the boar as they were declared pests and their village committee had acquired special permission from the government.
Our arsenal for the hunt included an odd assortment of 12-gauge shotguns. Ramesh carried a Russian-made Baikal single-barrel that, when fired repeatedly, became really hot. Nirmal sported an antique British gun, a 34-inch Greener inherited from his father, which often jammed at the wrong moment.
I was fortunate to have a double-barreled Webley & Scott, also British, which gave me an edge over my mates, as I could go for a quick second shot if need be.
Our visit to Bhirkot confirmed that the plight of the villagers was for real. At several locations, the maize crop – or what remained of it – lay trampled and chewed every which way we looked, as if the entire field had suffered a massive typhoon overnight.
We wondered how the boar managed to get into the fields, confined as they were to the forest by a sturdy-looking boundary wall. We made a tour of the fields and found that the wall was not high enough some places to frustrate the sinewy legs of the wild pigs and, worse still, it had caved in at several locations.
The wild hogs apparently stormed the crops in pairs or groups, covering as many as eight to ten different spots in a single visit. Not in daylight, though. Smart and wary, they bid their time until dark.
If the damage caused by the boar’s night sorties continued unchecked, I could well imagine what would remain of the crops by the harvesting time.
At night, villagers took turns to keep guard. To ward off the boar, empty tin cans were beaten and, the villagers resorted to yelling and shouting. Every year, with the help of government shikaris, or hunters, a few of the animals were even shot.
“The boars have grown in numbers so rapidly each year that both the Nagarjun and Shivapuri forests fail to provide for them,” Govinda, our host, told us.
The main reason for such rapid growth in the number of wild boar was not difficult to understand, as Govinda explained.
“A prolific breeder, a sow bears five or six piglets up to twice a year and the gestation period is just four months. The government does not allow hunting and, although the forest does have some leopards that can cull, they have not been very effective in reducing the numbers.
“Given the population boom and their notorious gluttony,” continued Govinda, “the forest of Nagarjun and Shivapuri fail to offer enough food for these wild critters. Consequently, the boars move out beyond the forest walls to the neighboring fields.”
My night vigil on the machan ended with the first streaks of dawn, with no sight or sound of a wild boar. I clambered down and called out to the old man sleeping in the nearby cowshed.
As I bid him goodbye on my way back to the village, he mumbled some words of thanks for having kept the night watch for him. The poor fellow must have slept well after a long time, since I had relieved him for the night.
“Hajoor, each night my son Maila and I take turns to shoo the pigs away,” was his parting lament.
I knew that neither of my companions lying in wait 200 yards apart had had any better luck, as no tell-tale gunshot was heard during the night. Ramesh, however, had a hair-raising account.
Around midnight, he heard a boar barely 20 paces from where he was crouched amidst the corn stalks.  He stalked it in darkness, virtually crawling on all fours, until he thought he could all but reach out and literally touch the animal with his bare hands.
Unaware of the danger from Ramesh, the boar kept chomping at the cobs, the sound like small crackers going off in the calm of the night.
Shaking with nervous excitement, Ramesh squinted into the dim moonlight trying hard to locate the source of the noise. He knew that to venture further would put him in danger, for wild boars are said to be treacherously aggressive. And he could no way shoot at the sound alone.
Ramesh made a frantic gesture to his village mate, who was bringing up the rear, to switch on the flashlight but, before the jumpy chap could train the light on the quarry, the boar spooked. The startled animal made an explosive dash, brushing past Ramesh and was gone in a dim blur in the moonlight.
“I almost suffered a cardiac arrest,” Ramesh finished in mock fear with a melodramatic gesture.
Last to appear that morning was a weary Nirmal, with bloodshot eyes, droopy shoulders and disappointment written all over his face. He, too, had a bizarre encounter.
“I saw not one but two of them,” he told us. We were all eyes and ears to hear his story.
After an uneventful, all-night vigil on a tree, Nirmal climbed down the tree with his village companion and headed for the village. As they trudged down a slope, he heard people talking in the distance.
It never occurred to Nirmal that a wild boar might cross their path, highly unlikely as it was for the animal to hang around after daylight and in the proximity of humans. But one did. Caught unawares, the two men froze in their tracks as their eyes locked on a big boar hardly ten feet away.
“Time stopped,” Nirmal said, “My heart kicked furiously at the sight of the hefty black boar staring back at me. Then, in a flash, the beast dashed for cover before I could even flex a muscle.”
He seemed breathless as he spoke. That was not all. Within seconds, yet another boar whizzed past and all he could do was watch helplessly.
So much for our wild boar hunt!
Back at the village, as we sipped tea at Govinda’s house; he graciously soothed our sapped spirits by assuring us of good luck the next time. We thanked him and the many villagers who had thronged to bid us goodbye and set off down the slope.
As I lay in the comfort of my bed that night, musing over the sequence of events at Bhirkot, the face of the old man kept flashing in my mind. He was at that very moment probably sitting it out on the machan, fighting a wretched battle against the nocturnal marauders of Bhirkot.
“Maybe we ought to make one of those hunting trips to Bhirkot again, if only for the old man’s sake,” I said to myself.

Four reasons why Shey-Phoksundo is the best place to avoid monsoon,"Tuesday, August 1, 2017","
There are many lakes in Nepal that have captured the imagination of travellers, both domestic and international. Among the lakes, Shey-Phoksundo has a unique place in the hearts of travellers.
Many globetrotters added the lake, situated at an altitude of 3,660 m, to their bucket list after the success of Eric Valli’s Caravan. Many in Nepal remember Shey-Phoiksundo as the country’s largest national park covering an area of 3,555 sq km.
Tucked away in the great Himalayas, the area falls under a ‘rain shadow’ area, and the monsoon does not bother you much. If it rains, you get clear blue skies and the sweet smell of earth.
But visiting the lake is not the only reason you should be going there.
The water


Three rivers flow through the park, the Khung, Nmajung, and Panjang. The rivers are crystal clear and untouched by human civilisation. As you walk around in the park, you are greeting with the slow rumble of gushing water.
The people

Upper Dolpo and Shey-Phoksundo Park are located in Nepal, but the people here are Tibetan in both culture and lifestyle. Most of the locals practice Bön (a pre-Buddhist faith) with its heavy emphasis on animism.
The flora and the butterflies

The park is rich in flora and fauna. Rare species of flowers grow in quiet places and are untouched by human hand. The park is also home to butterflies that are famous for surviving in high altitudes.
The landscape

For adventure junkies, the area offers rugged terrain like no other. For photographers, it is a paradise as light bounces off of the hills and takes various hues. The landscape is soothing to the eye and makes you wonder how beautiful Nepal is!",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/four-reasons-why-shey-phoksundo-is-the-best-place-to-avoid-monsoon.html,travel
Two trekking routes leading to Gosainkunda ready to greet travellers this Janaipurnima,"Tuesday, July 25, 2017","Nuwakot, July 25
Two trekking routes are being brought into full operation with necessary preparations for pilgrims and tourists heading to the Gosainkunda alpine lake on the occasion of Janaipurnima, an annual festival of the Hindus.
The festival is being celebrated coming Friday this year.
The two routes – one beginning from Kathmandu’s Sundarijal and another from Nuwakot’s Samundratar – have been equipped with all necessities for the travellers, according to hotel entrepreneurs.
This routes had been in operation for the past few years, but they lacked proper management and necessary support system.
The trek route from Sundarijal passes through the pristine landscapes in Chisapani, Kutungsang, Bhanginagoth, Chaharepati, Ghoptebhir to Suryakunda from where trekkers have to descend to Gosainkunda. The route is more prepared for the travellers than it had been in the past, according to Langtang Gosainkunda Helambu Hotel Entrepreneurs Concern Committee Vice-Chairman, Pemba Lama.

The pilgrims have already started heading towards their destination through the trekking route. It takes two days with rest from Sundarijal to reach Gosainkunda.
The most used route beginning from Gangate area of Bidur Municipality-5 passes through Kharanitar, Samundratar, Ramati, Gyangphedi, Talukseri to Suryakunda.
Hotel Entrepreneurs Concern Committee Secretary, Mingma Sherpa, says although it takes two days to reach Gosainkunda from Sundarijal, the route from Nuwakot’s Samundratar takes only one day. Samundratar, located 35 km away from Gangate, is accessible by four-wheelers.
The Gosainkunda lake is located at an altitude of 4,380 metres in the Rasuwa district. The lake remains frozen for six months during the winter season.

Balthali in monsoon: Exploring a different face of nature,"Tuesday, July 25, 2017","
For many, monsoon perhaps is not the best season to travel in Nepal. Most of the roads turn muddy and slippery and clouds block sightseeing.
But wait, if you are an avid travel enthusiast, the weather cannot be an issue. Further, there are some places which provide you with different tastes of natural beauty in the raining season. Go to Balthali of Kavre once.

Balthali is 42 kilometres away from Kathmandu. You can reach this village by travelling on public bus upto the ancient town of Panauti. Local hotels pick you on their four-wheelers from Panauti to reach Balthali.

Because it is so near to Kathmandu, Balthali can be one of the best options to spend your weekend in the monsoon. There are a number of hotels and resorts with good hospitality culture.


If you have quite more time, you can do a hiking from Namobuddha to this place.

The village is not much costly for tourists. There are homestay services as well for budget travellers.

"Janakpur: Meeting Ram, Sita and Shiva in the holy city","Thursday, July 20, 2017","Whenever we hear the name ‘Janakpur’, we remember the Ramayana, the brave prince from Ayodhya and his bride or the beautiful princess of Mithila.
Janakpur, formerly ‘Mithila’, was a thriving cultural centre in the ancient times. It was here that King Janak, one of the wisest men of his times, ruled over a prosperous kingdom. It was in this present-day eastern Terai town that the Maithili language and the arts flourished and spread to north India.

The Ram-Janaki Temple in the heart of Mithila is a testament of the proud history of the kingdom on which many folklore are based.
Religion plays an important part in the lives of the people of Janakpur, most of whom are Hindus. In Janakpur, you meet the Hindu gods Ram, Sita and Shiva whereever you go. There are temples dedicated to these gods, who play an important role in the lives of the people.

Many visitors say that Janakpur now needs to focus on keeping the city clean. They say that the ancient heritage of the city is under threat due to lack of proper maintenance and cleaning-up.


There’s no doubt that the city would welcome more tourists if it were to be kept cleaner.
Most of the numerous temples and shrines that dot the city have a Ramayana story linked with them. For example, there is a pond where the arrow discharged by Ram when he lifted the famous bow of Lord Shiva is believed to have landed.

On a summer day in Mithila, life is normally stagnant with heat taking a toll on the people. But come December, the city springs to life as Ram’s wedding procession arrives in Mithila again to take Sita with it.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/janakpur-meeting-ram-sita-and-shiva-in-the-holy-city.html,travel
Six reasons why Kailash-Mansarovar yatra is a trip of a lifetime,"Thursday, July 6, 2017","
Mt Kailash is, perhaps, the most sacred of all religious sites for Hindus, as well as Buddhists. The mountain, located in present day Tibet, is believed to the abode of Lord Shiva ‘Mahadev’ (the lord of all lords).
The remote location of the mountain as well as stringent border controls on the part of the Chinese authorities makes travelling to the holy mountain an arduous task, but once you get there, it’s all worth it.
Still in two minds about the trip? Here we look at six reasons why a pilgrimage to Kailash and Mansarovar should be number #1 on your bucket list:
The landscape

The journey to Kailash begins from Simikot in western Nepal. You can reach Simikot by flight from Nepalganj, western Nepal’s main tourism hub. You need to walk for three days to reach the Chinese border town of Hilsa, from where you can take a jeep for a bus.
The three-day walk takes you past some of the remotest parts of Nepal, where settlements are nowhere to be seen. It also takes you past some beautiful landscapes you will remember for a lifetime.
The rivers

Even at high altitudes, you get to see fast-flowing rivers that irrigate the area. The water has a distinct ‘Himalayan’ taste and you would want to drink a lot of water during the difficult trek.
The lake

The trip to Kailash is much about the lake Mansarovar as Mahadev’s abode, Kailash. The Mansarovar (lake) is considered the source of most sacred rivers in South Asia: the Indus, the Sutlej, the Brahmaputra, and the Karnali. This makes the lake sacred for billions of people around the world who follow Bon, Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism.
The other lake
Adjacent to the Mansarovar is another lake, the Rakshastal, another beautiful lake. According mythology, Mansorvar and the other lake was created by the Hindu god Brahma after getting its vision in his mind.
Place of worship
Many Hindus, especially from India, travel to the Mansarovar to organise special ceremonies close to the home of Lord Shiva. It is believed that prayers made near the Kailash mountain reaches the ears of the lord himself.

Witness China’s rapid development

After a two-day trek to the Chinese border, you get to see the stark differences between the areas in Nepal and north of the border. While the Chinese side has wide roads where big buses ply, walking is the only mode of transport on the Nepali side.

In pictures: A day in the life of ‘Himalayan Viagra’ pickers,"Friday, June 23, 2017","

As monsoon clouds enter Nepal from the Bay of Bengal, hordes of people descend the highlands of the western hills, some with their bags full while some with hope to have their bags full the next time.
This is the story of Nepal’s ‘yarsa pickers’, who take up the challenge to collect the ‘magic fungus’ by scouring areas over 5,000m to pick enough of the ‘medicine’ to meet their basic needs for an entire year. Thangboche in western Nepal, is one of the most popular areas for yarsa pickers.



The perilous journey often starts from the remote hills of Rukum, Jajarkot and Dolpa where settlements turn into ‘ghost villages’ ahead of the yarsa season. Motor-able roads are a rarity in the area, locals spend days trekking to Thangboche in pursuit of a better livelihood in the year to come. For some, the journey starts two months in advance as they slowly make to the the highlands.


The yarsa pickers pass through treacherous rivers, feeble bridges and punishing terrain. They spend up to Rs 1,000 ($10) a day on the journey. This is money they have borrowed from friends and family to get hold of the magical herb and to earn a profit after repaying the loan.

It takes around five days to reach Thangboche from Dolpa’s headquarters Dunai. For the residents of Dho Tarap, the highest settlement of Nepal, the journey takes five hours.



The yarsa pickers need a lot of energy to scour the fields the entire day. They need extra calories to get back home and to sell their find in the market. That is why they carry a lot of rice with them and camp early in the morning to have a plate of rice and lentils to keep them going for the day.



Then the search begins. In the past it was easy for them to find yarsa without much effort, but as more and more people are coming to the area in search of the wonder drug, it is becoming difficult to find one. While an average person would find at least 50 pieces until a few years ago, the number has gone down to 15. There are even those remain empty handed for the whole day.


As dusk comes, the lucky ones remove the dust off the yarsa so that they do not have to carry unnecessary weight during their journey home. They then collect everything and keep it in their bag, which they do not let out of sight even for a moment. A single piece of yarsa can fetch up to Rs 500 ($5).


The nights are cold and harsh. People gather in front of the fire to make plans for the next day. While some remain to continue the hunt for the next day, others return home cursing their luck.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/in-pictures-a-day-in-the-life-of-himalayan-viagra-pickers.html,travel
Seven days on the Annapurna trail: Little ol’ Emily makes it to the ABC,"Friday, June 16, 2017","How can I begin to describe my experiences in the completely captivating country of Nepal? I experienced everything touristy- walked the streets of Kathmandu, and travelled to some of the national parks and most popular cities. I took boat rides on lakes, tasted dal bhat, and met the friendliest beings I’ve encountered in my life. But the trek to the Annapurna Base Camp was the most exciting and difficult part of my adventure in Nepal.

On the first day I was feeling determined, motivated and fascinated. I come from the Prairies in Canada, where the land is flat. There are no mountains and hills for trekking are non-existent. Having said all that, I was wondering if I could make it to the Annapurna Base Camp. The tenth highest mountain in the world has one of the hardest routes; it’s where people often break their legs or suffer from altitude sickness.
I knew the experience was going to be worth it, I had rushed feelings of thrill and doubt at the same time. But that’s just background stuff. We met our porters in Phedi, the starting point of our trek. We had hired two porters, Ganesh and Tanka, the most genuine, hard working, interesting father- son duo I’ve had the chance to meet. To be honest, until half an hour before we began, I was feeling sick.
Ganesh and Tanka carried two full backpacks plus their small bag. It didn’t feel right. I felt like what we were doing was inhumane and on the other hand I had heard they would get paid well and would be able to support their families for months by working for two weeks on the field.
So, we decided we would get another porter, but they would not come until later. The trek began with the famous ‘1 billion stairs’. Ok, I’m exaggerating! But there were a lot of stairs. We literally walked for three to four hours at a stretch. Somewhere on the route, I even stopped counting.

Luckily, Ganesh was there to keep us motivated. His love for chitchat was helping me pass the time. He was someone who didn’t believe in love; he believed in god. He was someone who didn’t support women’s programmes but spoke highly about women being strong and able to do anything they set out to do. He was so contradictory at times, but it was good because he presented different ideas. Ahhh, enlightenment!
So finally, after eight hours of hiking… or rather, climbing stairs was over we arrived in Tolka, a small village on the lap of the mountains where we could see from our room’s window clouds pass through the mountains and then. There was no warm water, oh, and huge jumping spiders. Nonetheless, I was enjoying myself. Physically, my body was sorer than I could have imagined. But I had accomplished a full day of hiking and sweating. My mind was strong, and I began to really experiencing life in the mountains.
In the evening, I wrote my journal, reflecting upon the journey of the day. I had observed so many grand trees full of lush, green moss. Waterfalls that ran rapidly for miles far beyond what I could see. I had jumped over wobbly rocks, crossed bridges that sway as you cautiously make your way to the other side. But it was beautiful.
Wondering how many times could I have died on the way, I fell into a deep, well-needed sleep.


6:30 am: We woke up, ate some chapatti bread with honey.
7:30 am: We started our trek. We make it up to the next hill in five hours. I ate a big plate of veg fried noodles. Since we were close to some hot springs, all of us decided that it would be worth going there. Down we went to the Jhino hot spring. The closer we got, I began to see huge waterfalls, surrounded by woods and two hot spring pools. We took a dip. The hot spring was the epitome of relaxation, or laziness, whatever you want to call it.
I was in a complete euphoric state. Soon the hot spring time came to an end, but I was refreshed and motivated to finish the trek. We were only two hours away from Chhomrong. Tip to anyone going this direction: go to the Fishtail Hostel, they have friendly owners, good food, Wi-Fi, hot shower, a great view and charge only Rs 200 a room. You really can’t go wrong.
I wished I had kept track of different plants I had observed. If you say there are a lot of people in the world, imagine how many plants there are in the world! Everything I saw was vibrant, everything I could breathe was rich with oxygen, everything I smelt was fresh and everything I touched was soft.
My mind was so stimulated that I was discovering my surroundings, challenging my mind and body. I was feeling accomplished already. I couldn’t believe that my body mass was pushing to complete full days of trekking. Maybe it was the rain that was making me feel refreshed as the drops gently hit my skin and face.
We arrived in Dovan, tired, of course. We relaxed until supper and afterwards played cards. As I lay in bed I was reflecting on the changes in my mind. I wasn’t concerned with materialistic things. I was enjoying the simplicity, yet complexity, of the beautiful mountains and everything it had to offer. I was so lost in the scenery and the nature that it calmed my mind and soul.


It was only day 4.
Again, my mind was cleared by the purity of earth, water, light and air. It felt like meditation. Enjoying what was in the moment and forgetting life behind me. Can you say carpe diem? I was adjusting to this mentality and enjoying the therapeutic benefits it was providing me with.
My soul was becoming satisfied with every step I was taking. Every movement had to be balanced and contemplated or the consequence would be me falling into a waterfall, or off the edge of a cliff. Did I mention we went on the trek during the monsoon season and everything is slippery when wet? The possibilities of death or injury were endless.
I saw these obstacles as challenges, I was ready to conquer them. Yes, I had my doubts, but I also had my curiosity. Can I do this? Well I’m sure as hell going to try! I was proud of the strength I pulled out of somewhere. At the end of the day I realised we had reached the Machhapuchhre Base Camp(MBC).
We got a good view of the top of Machhapuchhre and Annapurna south. I felt so small next to the mountains. I made it this far! No sickness, no injuries, all positive feelings and experiences.
The day’s wakening up was a bit of a disaster. None of us was feeling a 100%. Some of us had a headache, others had nausea and none of us slept well. To top it off, during an attempt at drying some clothes by a water heater, the water in on heater had spilled. Leaving Leonie’s and Lisa’s shoes soaked.
I forgot to mention… there was SNOW where we were staying. The combination was not good. But we managed. We packed up, ate, hydrated ourselves and each took a pill. Diamoxin prevents altitude sickness.
Everyone was slightly worried. Again, this thought of ‘is this going to end badly?’ hit my brain over and over. We all knew we had to try though, it was our goal after all. Everyone told us to listen to our bodies when we are up in the mountain. Today was the day we were going to make it to Annapurna Base Camp whether we liked it or not.
The view was a good distraction; waterfalls flowed under the snow. The top of the mountains were so close it felt like I just could just reach out my hand to touch them. The air was thin, but fresh with rain. And then I could see it “Welcome to Annapurna base came (4130)”.
Little ol’ Emily’s made it to the ABC! And I was so proud. We had zero visibility due to the clouds and fog, some may say a misfortune. We had victory BBQ chips, ginger tea (I ordered black tea but whatever) and posted photos when we reached the lodge at the base camp.
After a short visit, we headed back down to the MBC . We weren’t in the greatest of conditions and we wanted to get down as soon as possible. I think after accomplishing our goal, we lost the motivation to continue the trek.

Wake up. Head down, down, down. Back to Chhomrong (remember the place I recommended? Don’t forget). We were heading down, but don’t let that fool you, we had to walk many stairs. I thought my legs would give up.
I honestly did.
I wanted to finish the trek today. My body was telling me I couldn’t. Of course, I pushed, and I made it. The motivation now was the Italian restaurant in Pokhara, pizza, pasta, beer, and a nice hotel. I was getting irritated with being surrounded by others all the time, I needed a day of alone time.
In the evening, we decided to split the group as some of us wanted to do a longer hike and some of us a shorter. As I mentioned earlier, it was supposed to be a 10-day hike but we agreed we would stop at seven.
It was just a matter of the last day trek being longer or shorter. I chose the shorter option as I knew I couldn’t find the determination to do a full day of trekking again. The discussion ended the night as there was a bit of tension, although nothing serious. I was off to bed with the thought of Pokhara.



The last day. Italian restaurant. Warm shower. Warm weather. Yesssss.
Although the day did not end without hardships. It was one of the hottest days since we landed in Nepal. What was only a four-hour trek felt like an eight-hour trip. I think we were on the brink of getting heat stroke.
I could hardly wait to be done. We took a short break and when Lisa and I headed down the path we wondered if we were going the right way. Lisa headed a bit backwards to see if he’s around. About seven minutes went by and I started to worry.
I don’t see Lisa or Tanka and I began to panic. I’m thinking ‘I’m in a Nepali mountain village, I have no way to contact someone, not even sure if this is the right path back’.
Ok, finally, I saw Lisa, no Tanka. We decided to head forward and hope we would find him. We did find him later and then we haphazardly rushed to the bus station. Done.
So, what can I say about the Annapurna Base Camp trek?
It was demanding but peaceful. I encountered challenges and accomplishments. I cleared my mind from city life. I became stronger mentally, physically and spiritually.
I would recommend this trek to everyone as it really allows you to appreciate the scenery, feel empowered and face a positive reality. I won’t say it was not hard, it was probably the hardest expedition I will ever go on. But the gratification and liberty I felt afterwards was worth every second!

"Meanwhile in Nepal’s highest settlement, time stands still","Wednesday, June 14, 2017","
The people are still involved in subsistence farming, they have almost no connection with the outside world and services such as electricity and health care are nowhere to be seen.
In Dho and Tarap (collectively known as ‘Dho-Tarap), considered the highest inhabited area in Nepal, a few hundred people, most of whom are Tibetan-speaking, lead a life untouched by time.



The villages are situated over 4,000m above sea level. It takes at least five days of trekking to reach the settlement from Dolpa district headquarters, Dunai. Winter, it seems, is the only season the village experiences throughout the year.
The villages spend most of their time grazing their animals and praying. An ancient form of Buddhism is the dominant religion in the area.

The food that the people grow is barely enough for them to sustain. The main activity that sustains life in these villages is the trade in medicinal herbs, including yarsagumba aka the Himalayan Viagra.
Temba Gurung, an independent candidate who recently won the position of Dolpo Buddha Rural Municipality’s Chairman, says the area has a lot of potential for tourism, but it hasn’t been fully utilised yet.


Religion plays a central role in the villages. Men and women are often seen carrying their prayer beads and chanting prayers.
The region’s proximity with the Tibetan Autonomous Region since ancient times has meant that the lifestyle of the people from the north influences those in the south.

The reality of the village sinks in on travellers who reach the village, only when dusk turns into night. Under the star-lit sky, the settlement stands still, and the cracking of a door somewhere far in the village can be heard clearly.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/meanwhile-in-nepals-highest-settlement-time-stands-still.html,travel
Monsoon madness: Hard-earned grandmaster’s championship,"Monday, June 5, 2017","
I began wondering as I sweated my guts out pedalling my mountain bike up the steep hill. The tires spun slimy mud all over me, my lungs felt like they would burst and my knees buckle from the strain.
“What on earth am I doing on this godforsaken track?” Curiously enough, I kept it up stoically.
That was in August 2010.  I was still a rookie, only nine months into mountain biking when I took part in a cross-country race staged by Kathmandu Bike Station, Pani Pokhari, Kathmandu. Spurred on by my friends and co-riders, I participated in the race despite being of two minds initially and lacking confidence. That was my first ever and most memorable race experience. Named MTB Madness, the race for me, a guy aged 56, was a sheer madness indeed.
The race venue was Budhanilakantha – a burgeoning uptown bazaar popular for the historic sapphire shrine of the God Vishnu resting on a thousand-headed snake-god (Shesh Nag) in a small pond. The kickoff point was the Budanilakantha School, just a couple of hundred yards away.
The race would begin on a paved road that led to the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park. After some 500 yards the route turned towards a dirt track leading to the Chandeswori shrine, Tokha before dropping sharply to the left to a foot trail that cut across paddy fields and solitary mud houses rejoining a dirt road slimy with the monsoon rains at a bridge over the Bishnumati River.
The road then ran across paddy fields lined with a cluster of houses until it met a paved road that led back to the starting point. This made one lap, or 5.5 km. The riders in the grand masters’ category (above 50 years) had to do three laps.
The big day finally arrived. All excited about the race, I hardly slept the night before. When I arrived at the kickoff point, the site was already abuzz with feverish activity. It was quite a sight to see the place crawling with bikers looking their best in colourful jerseys and slacks with snazzy crash helmets to match.
The line-up was impressive and overwhelming: one hundred riders. The milling crowd also included friends and my wife Radhika, who had come to cheer me. The weather that morning at 9.30 did not look promising. There was no sun and a dull overcast monsoon sky made a downpour look imminent. The race was, however, set in stone—rain or shine.
Word got around that the two-time national champion Ajay Pandit was also competing. I had no idea who was who. To me, every biker looked cool and intimidating. My heart sank when I spotted a couple of tall brawny “kuire” (foreign) bikers, looking almost my age group. By the time the race started I was a nervous wreck, you bet!
Every rider had a number tag fastened on the handlebar, and another pinned up at the back of the jersey, different colour corresponding with the category. The excitement mounted with every passing minute as the riders were called to flag off.
Finally, the whistle was blown and, amidst loud cheering and clapping, the race kicked off. The elites occupied the front row followed by the juniors and women. The veterans, masters and the grand masters filled the rear.
I did fine as I pedalled furiously on the pitted paved road with watery holes up the first incline—a little breathless though. Bikers swished past me but I left some behind too. My confidence soared on the first downhill for I considered myself fairly good and fast on that particular off-road track from Budanilakantha to Chandeswori shrine, which I had done several times on previous occasions. “Swoosh!” A couple of bikers blazed past me and disappeared at a bend. Maybe I was not so fast, after all!
After the gravelly off-road going through a wooded hill with tricky bends and sheer drops, the trail switched to a single track slimy with mud, nearly ankle-deep. I ploughed through, the tires skidding in the thick slime. “Whoops!” I slipped and the next thing I knew I was lying in a heap a couple of feet down in the bushes! Luckily, I did not slip further down the slope. I managed to scramble back up onto the track unscathed. Breathless and muddied, I continued on the track.  Amidst loud, rousing cheers, I breezed through the finish line, completing the first lap.  I pedalled furiously past but could not miss a smiling face, waving wildly at me from the crowd—my wife, Radhika.
Lap two was uneventful for me – but not for everyone. One biker slid past me, skidded, tried to steady and then flipped over. I winced as the poor chap landed head first into the mud, his bike on top. Later after the race, I learned that just about every biker had fallen off his/her bike on the monsoon ravaged track.
The going was getting progressively tougher and slower for me. Even the first incline had me almost wheezing. It must be age, I reminded myself. Churned up relentlessly by the racers, the trail had become muddier. As the minutes went by, every thrust on the pedal seemed an ordeal. My GT Avalanche bike’s mud-caked chain and drive-trains grated and rasped miserably.
On one of the steep inclines, I spotted a lady-biker sitting by the track.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” I gasped.
“I’ve been falling all the time,” she sounded almost tearful.
“Come on, you can do it. Get up and get going,” I said, trying to cheer her up.
As I cleared the top, I looked over my shoulder. She was already on her way up. Guess what, she grabbed the third standing on the podium!
The going got tougher by the minute. What seemed, however, a welcome sight, was the cheering and clapping bunch stationed at different feed zones, who, apart from offering water, worked wonders to raise the failing spirit of the riders.
The last lap seemed unending. By the time I cleared one of the punishing inclines, I was a total wreck. Fatigue seemed to get the better of me. At one stage, I nearly felt like abandoning the race, but suddenly Radhika’s beaming face flashed before my eyes and I managed to drag myself.
“Hang on in there….this is the last lap,” I kept mumbling to myself, almost in a stupor. With a last gasp, I tore down the final leg, legs pumping like crazy, as if there was no tomorrow.
Hundred yards …fifty… twenty … ten … five … and I cruised through the finish line to the waiting crowd that erupted into rapturous applause. Even before I stopped I saw smiling faces and rushing hands thrust towards me.
“Congratulations, you’ve won.”
The words seemed to freeze in time.
Later, I learned that the grandmaster’s category, which I’d won, had only three contestants. One had pulled out at the last moment and the other did not complete the course. As it turned out, it was almost an uncontested victory for me. What of it? I still became a champ, didn’t I?

Three places to begin your meditation journey in Kathmandu,"Thursday, May 25, 2017","
Despite its popularity and panoptic appeal, meditation is still a widely misunderstood subject. Nepal is full of places that allow people to explore various meditation techniques and delve into the philosophies that underlie them.
Here we have covered three such places that may inspire you to take meditation more seriously and bring you closer to people with similar interests.
Dharma Shringa Vipassana Meditation Center

Located about nine km north of the Ring Road intersection at Narayan Gopal Chowk, this meditation center sprawls on a slope of Shivapuri Hill at an altitude of 5,200 feet. A black-topped road runs from Budhanilakantha right up to the center’s gate, so getting to the place is no problem. This center is next door to the Shivapuri National Park’s entrance gate at Pani Muhan.
Although the center looks almost like a continuation of the Shivapuri National Park, the difference becomes starkly clear when one sees how the park’s wilderness gives way to a beautifully landscaped facility that resembles a well-maintained resort. Inside, an explosion of colourful flowers greet visitors, and the well-maintained greenery along the stairs and pathways that crisscrosses the facility adds to the serenity of the place.
The entire setting makes visitors feel at home immediately and settles them down for lengthy residential retreats. The center runs a ten-day beginners’ course for meditators and several other long and short-term courses for those who have mastered the basic techniques. There are several meditation halls and residential quarters, and a large stupa that houses several isolated meditation cells. The main meditation hall can seat up to 250 people at a time and the stupa has 84 individual meditation cells.
Vipassana meditation has three phases: Anapana, Vipassana and Metta. During Anapana, the natural flow of breath is observed to improve concentration. During Vipassana phase, body sensations like heat, cold, itching, prickling, tickling, pain are observed. Metta, the last phase, emphasises praying for all with a pure mind and body. The whole technique hinges on the central idea that our reactions to stimuli, from outside or within us, is pointless because everything is anicchha or impermanent. Knowing this by experience through the practice of meditation bolsters equanimity and sets the meditator on the path of liberation.
To attend a ten-day course at Dharmashringa, contact Nepal Vipassana Center’s city office at 4250581, 4223968 or visit www.np.dhamma.org. To know more about worldwide Vipassana centers log on to www.dhamma.org.

Shivapuri Baba Ashram
This ashram is dedicated to a little-known, yet highly revered, Hindu ascetic, Shivapuri Baba. (He was named after the Shivapuri Hill, where he lived for years in a hut before moving down the Valley floor). As per various claims, he lived until the age of 130 or 140, and left the body willingly in full consciousness in 1962. The ashram is sequestered in the Dhrubasthali forest, an extension of the Mrigasthali forest on the hillock east of the Pashupatinath Temple.
Although accessible after a short walk across the road from the Tilganga Eye Hospital and a short climb up a forested knoll, the ashram is hidden from sight. The forest you need to pass through to reach the ashram is dense enough to make you feel uneasy if you are hiking alone, but in a group you feel absolutely no fear and the greenery, and hillocks all around you make the place look like an ideal picnic spot.
It is quite likely that the moment you step into the clearing where the one-story, hut-shaped ashram stands, your everyday self will melt away and silence itself into a seeker. Even the most restless souls wouldn’t mind spending some time in meditation after reaching the ashram. For serious meditators – and I have heard this from many of them – the spiritual pull is unmistakable there.
One of the things you have to bear in mind while going to the ashram is that a huge population of monkeys hangs around the place. They won’t pay you any attention if you let them be and it is best not to carry any edible item openly. Although Shivapuri Baba made no effort to establish a cult or commune, he emphasised on maintaining physical, mental and spiritual discipline through right living for the realisation of the higher self.
The ashram is open to all and it is the right place for anyone one who wants to spend their morning or daytime in quiet contemplation. Visitors are not permitted into the premises of the ashram after 6 PM.

Yogoda Satsanga Meditation Society, Kupandole

Despite busy roads and dense settlements all around, this place is surprisingly peaceful. Located behind Gurudwara, the Sikh shrine in Kupandole, the center was established by the disciples of Paramahansa Yogananda to practice and propagate the teachings and techniques of Kriya Yoga.
The Kriya Yoga system combines several stages of pranayama, mantra (chantings), and mudra (asanas) to rapidly accelerate spiritual development and engender a profound state of tranquility and what the practitioners call the ultimate state of God-communion. Rediscovered and passed on by latter-day sadhus since the mid-19th century, the concept is said to resemble the Raja Yoga of Patanjali and is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.
Although the centre is built on a small piece of land, space has been utilised beautifully to augment spiritual grandeur. The centre’s gate opens to a cemented path lined with trees and plants. Inside, a small patch of neatly trimmed lush grass and more trees and plants contribute to the tranquility of the place.
The two-storey building that houses the Society features large, spacious halls on both floors. The ground floor is a sort of administrative unit where one can get all the information about the Society, such as the process to become a member, meditation courses, and special events. You can also buy books and read newsletters on yoga and meditation.
The meditation hall on the floor above is an airy, light-filled spacious room with pictures of Lord Krishna, Jesus Christ and other saints, including Paramahansa and his gurus, adorning the front wall. The pictures, soothing fragrance and intermittent sounds of chirping birds blend beautifully to create an atmosphere ideal for meditation.
Although the centre is open every day, more experienced meditators make it a point to gather on Thursdays and Saturdays for special sessions. From time to time Kriya Yoga masters from Ranchi, India lead meditation sessions at the centre.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/three-places-to-begin-your-meditation-journey-in-kathmandu.html,travel
"Why never, ever go near a mama bear when she’s with her cub","Sunday, May 21, 2017","
We did not even imagine that our casual elephant safari ride would turn into a hot pursuit.
It all started when our elephant, Laxmikali, passed by a freshly-stirred mud wallow followed by equally fresh footprints. Apparently, after a refreshing mud bath, the animal had sauntered into the woods, leaving behind a hot trail.  Thus began our stalk, as we closely followed the marks.
We followed the footprints through the elephant grass, the woods, the seemingly impenetrable scrub and thickets with spiny thorns—nothing stopped Laxmikali.
When we thought we were closing in on our quarry, the trail suddenly went cold. It was almost 6.15 p.m. and the fading light reminded us we had only 15 to 20 minutes before it would get too dark to continue. With sinking hearts, we detoured and with our eyes straining hard to penetrate the thick undergrowth, we lumbered on.
As the setting sun reddened the horizon, sending diffused crimson rays through the woods, the jungle burst into life. The bulbuls, the barbets, the orioles and a myriad of species that abounded the rainforest commenced chattering their loudest.
Jungle fowls fell in, calling each other lustily, aand then a distant peafowl let out a shrill ‘meow’. All these resident birds joined in a chorus simply to announce the approach of dusk.
Lo and behold, we stumbled upon the spoor!
With renewed hopes and redoubled pace, we crashed through the foliage. Twice my foot got trapped in jungle creepers, swinging branches lashed at my face, thorns clawed at my arms and I literally got banged by overhead branches.

My co-riders (my wife and daughter) were in no less harrowing condition; but no less excited.  We kept on our pursuit but the chances now appeared very slim. Disappointed, we turned back towards camp but hardly had we taken a few strides when we virtually bumped into him!
“There it is”, called Gun Bahadur Kumal, our mahout, almost in a whisper and pointed to a clump of thorny bush.
There stood our fearless quarry staring back at us, almost 5 ft at the shoulder, 9 ft in length, the pride of the Chitwan National Park, the inimitable one-horned Rhino.
Kumal urged Laxmikali to get closer enabling us hurried snapshots of the magnificent animal. On our way back, Kumal stopped to point us out fresh pugmarks of a male tiger.
My family and I had this thrilling safari ride in the Chitwan National Park (Midwest, Nepal), at the Island Jungle Resort, Bandarjhola, some 35 km from Narayanghat (145 km from Kathmandu). Set amidst dense riverine forest and interspersed with large tracts of grasslands, the resort then boasted a unique location with river Narayani hemming it in on two sides while the other two are ringed by the river’s subsidiaries (all jungle resorts inside the park were closed later).
Back in the comfort of the resort’s well-stocked Tharu (Tharus are an ethnic community from the lower Terai plains) bar with a mug of chilled beer and river Narayani at arm’s length, my mind kept going back to the mind-boggling ride we had.
Kumal’s charismatic expertise and Laxmikali’s rapport with her tamer was just spectacular.  Upon being asked about some of his memorable experiences, he had a hair-raising story to tell.
“The incident took place while I was doing a safari ride for two foreign guests,” Kumal began.
“I had with me the same elephant, Laxmikali.”
Suddenly, we ran into a sloth bear right on our track,” he continued. The bear happened to stand guard for her 6-month old cub perched on a jamun tree branch some 15 feet above the ground. Normally a lone bear, except for a brief display of aggression, does not pose a real threat; but she can turn real nasty if accompanied by her cub.”
Laxmikali stopped in her tracks, but did not take alarm. Kumal thought it better to give the bear a clear berth.  Too late! The mother bear turned around sharply and without so much as a warning charged at a run with a blood- curdling growl baring her fangs.
From 15 yards, the bear drew closer in a bound, and still kept coming! At a couple of yards, she suddenly stopped, stood on her toes and baring her fangs, snarled viciously. Laxmikali froze, so did Kumal.
The silence at the back on the hauda also spoke of the guests’ plight. As Kumal’s concern was the safety of the guests, the only course left for him was to make a slow retreat. Just as Kumal gently nudged with his toes for Laxmikali to back off, the bear struck taking a nasty bite of Laxmikali’s trunk.
All hell broke loose as Laxmikali went berserk.

She retaliated immediately.  An ear-splitting trumpeting that shook the ground could be heard for miles.
Kumal’s dismay knew no bounds when Laxmikali instead of turning upon the bear dashed for the tree and lashed her trunks on to the branch pulling down the terrified cub which clutched at the branches. Stunned by this unexpected move the bear backed off but still kept at her vicious lunges. So far, thank God, no harm had come to the guests,
But he realised the situation was getting out of hand. Try, though he did his best, no amount of coaxing or even sharp clouting with his iron hook helped to curb Laxmikali’s fury. Enraged, she kept on pulling down at the cub.
All this while, the mother bear’s challenging snarls, and lunges appeared feeble against the animal 10 times her size.
Suddenly there was a loud crack and even before Kumal could gather his wits a stout branch came crashing down hitting him on the chest and the side of his face, almost knocking him off of Laxmikali’s back.
He blacked out, a searing pain gripping his chest.
The traumatic state must have lasted just a few seconds when he slowly recovered.  He instinctively felt for his face to find a badly bruised lip and a deep gash on the side, his fingers coming back sticky with his own warm blood.
Apprehensively, he looked back to find one of the howdah supports broken in two but his guests, though badly shaken, safe.

With blood streaming down his face he wearily took stock of the situation. Laxmikali’s whole body twitched with an intense rage and she seemed ready for another attack. The mother bear, not more than two meters away with the fallen cub huddled behind her, still stood her ground and continued growling menacingly.
Thank God, for that very moment, two safari elephants converged on the scene to Kumal’s rescue.
Guided by the shouts and the commotion, they had rushed to the spot. Upon seeing two more elephants as back-ups the bear thought it wise to slink away with her cub—thus ending a gory drama.
Kumal had to have seven stitches to his face and it took almost a month for him to fully recover.
As Kumal wound up his story and left for his quarters, a night heron raised a plaintive wail from the banks of the Narayani river. Then, moments later from the deep recess of the jungle I heard a tiger call.

Nightfall in the city of devotees,"Friday, May 5, 2017","
Most people who have been to Bhaktapur would remember clear blue skies, a bustling palace square and groups of western tourists roaming the ancient city. Most people, including those who live in the Kathmandu Valley only have memories of the City of Devotees during the day.
So what happens here at night? Very few people know.


When the sun sets in the horizon, Bhaktapur springs back to life after a long tedious day. The lights are turned on, and people who have returned home after a busy day of work go for a walk around the Siddhapokhari (pond). The pond is where you meet almost all of Bhaktapur jogging, chatting and even watching the fish swim.



When the sun is completely gone, the ancient town turns into a busy marketplace. People from all over town descend onto the various squares of the city to buy vegetables, discuss politics and feel the gentle breeze.
When the moon is up, there are only a few people left in Bhaktapur who can call themselves ‘tourists’. The town, which is brimming with tourists during the day, is taken over by the local residents of the city. After the ‘selfie’ takers and the DSLR wielders are gone, the real Bhaktapur is what remains.


Motorbikes take over the old alleys of the city and release a cacophony of noise during rush hour. But after a while, the only sound you hear is that of locals singing hymns and making merry taking sips of the local chhyang.
You also get to see lights take over the surrounding hills and the highway leading to Bhaktapur.


Almost all restaurants and cafes are virtually empty in the evening. They are ideal for a quiet dinner as you soak in the sounds of the city.
Bhaktapur has always been an appealing destination for day trips, but the Newar city is perhaps a better destination for overnight trips as well.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nightfall-in-the-city-of-devotees.html,travel
The 25-year-old pellet: A shikar anecdote from Nepal’s Terai,"Monday, May 1, 2017","
One fine morning, a man in a camouflage baseball cap and matching fatigue crawled doggy fashion on a freshly cut rice field, a gun clutched in his right hand.
The field, still wet with the morning mist, wets and soils his clothes and the paddy stubbles hurt—for all he cares. It turns out he is stalking a bevvy of jungle fowl foraging for fallen paddy. But before the man can bear his barrel onto his quarry, the chickens burst into flight, leaving behind a breathless angry man mouthing obscenities.
That was Vijay, my friend, and it was the first day of our hunting trip to eastern Nepal—a village called Kanchanpur in Saptari district, some 400 km away from Kathmandu. We made that trip way back in the late 1990s, when hunting was officially open.
When it came to hunting, with the beginning of the season (Sept till Feb) around the corner, hunters couldn’t wait to start planning their trips. An excited duo, so did Vijay and I, a trifle too early—almost four weeks ahead of time. We planned on shooting red jungle fowl and chir kaliz pheasant, which ran aplenty in the thick forest north of the village.  If lucky, we could run into an elusive peafowl or two.
The elongated forest belt in Kanchanpur runs along the Chure hills that undulate from east to west as far as you can see. The south looks onto the Mahendra Highway and vast swathes of fertile land. The iconic 56-gate Koshi Barrage at Bhimnagar is some 22km east.
After attending to the formalities of acquiring the hunting licence, we eventually left for the much-awaited trip—an 8-hour drive from Kathmandu. The first half of the highway (Thankot/Naubise/Mugling/Narayanghat) traversed the rugged hilly country with tricky switchbacks and sheer drops with the Trishuli river raging below. Since I’d driven on that stretch of the highway before, I was confident behind the wheels of my trusted Maruti Gypsy jeep.
The winding drive almost ended at Narayanghat and flatter landscapes—the Inner Terai—with the Mahabharat range to the north stretched onward Hetauda. After Amlekhganj, once famous for its short-gauge railways (1920s), the Terai (translating to foothills) stretched all the way to our destination, the legendary Charkoshe Jhadi (literally, 12km jungle) en route after Pathlaiya.
Kanchanpur, then, was a small sleepy village with mostly mud houses and thatched roofs. Some well-to-do families had brick houses roofed with baked clay tiles. We were to stay at a friend’s house, who happened to be a doctor practising in Kathmandu.

Our hunt began the very next day. The jungle was located at the foothills of the Chure in the north and it took us hardly a half hour’s walk across clusters of huts, mud houses and cultivated fields. Early morning walks through those scattered settlements, the crisp weather, the pungent smell of smoke from burning stoves, the sticky honey-like smell of the freshly-cut paddy—all had a heady effect on me.
Now for our armoury, Vijay carried a single barrel 12-gauge Baikal shotgun; I had a double-barrel Webley and Scott, a British gun inherited from my father. Jagat, a local villager, served as our guide.
We soon realised that game did not come as easily as we had thought.  The first day brought nothing but a blank. On the second day, though, we managed a couple of shots at the chickens on the wings; we met with only annoying misses.
Even Jagat, who knew the area like the back of his hand, was amazed by the poor sightings of jungle fowl. “It is strange, this area used to be crawling with chickens,” said Jagat, shaking his head in frustration.
“Rest assured though, sirs, tomorrow, I’ll take you to a different spot that’s sure to have chickens, and pheasants, too,” Jagat added confidently. That raised our hopes.
On the third day, we chose to explore the Rai Khola(river) that cut its course deep into the Chure hills in the north. The narrow river gully was flanked by thickly wooded hills. Jagat’s words turned to be true and the day three proved a success.
Vijay managed to bag three chickens while I satisfied myself with two.
The pheasants, however, seemed elusive.
Celebrations followed that evening as we helped ourselves with some local raksi (alcohol) and the day’s prize shoot, wild chicken curry. Wow, other domestic chicken meat was no match for that distinctive sharp flavour that left us licking our fingers with relish.
On day four, Jagat decided we beat a strip of stout sal, sisau and scrub jungle called the nursery, north of the highway. Once deep into the woods, we pressed on stealthily, twenty yards separating us. Jagat, unarmed, brought up Vijay’s rear.
Once deep into the woods, we pressed on stealthily, twenty yards separating us. Jagat, unarmed, brought up Vijay’s rear.
Once deep into the woods, we pressed on stealthily, twenty yards separating us. Jagat, unarmed, brought up Vijay’s rear. We kept a slow pace, nerves taut with anticipation and palpitation running at fever pitch. Except for the sound of distant pealing of cattle bells and the intermittent chatter of bulbuls and jays, the jungle remained hushed. Suddenly a cock pheasant broke cover.
Bang, I fired!




Two things happened in quick succession.

A stray pellet had ricocheted off an outcrop on the ground and found its mark on his back. Near panic, I felt the terra firma slip beneath me. After a hurried conference, we decided to pack up and end our hunting trip. If Vijay was as distraught as I, he did not show it. Consumed by uneasy thoughts, I spent the night in tosses and turns.
With the approaching light the next morning, and an unsettling reminder what axe was to befall upon us, I stepped on the gas. Time dragged on leaden feet before we finally made it to Kathmandu on time to see the doctor friend of mine.
“Lo and behold!”
We were in for the biggest surprise of our lives. After administering a shot of tetanus and a smile on his face, my doctor friend, to our great consternation, ruled out an operation saying the pellet lodged into the back muscles would do no harm whatsoever even if it stayed embedded for life. He said he would not mind operating on it but it would be painful and not worth, just a waste of time. Dumbfounded, Vijay and I gaped at each other, in total disbelief.
Dumbfounded, Vijay and I gaped at each other, in total disbelief.
That finally settled our nerves though, and we sighed in great relief.  All fears and doubts dispelled, I slept that night at peace with the world.
Twenty-five years now, Vijay is in fine fettle and still carries the pellet in his back. Whenever together, we laugh off the misadventure.

The new mountain flight: It begins right from the heart of the Himalayas,"Sunday, April 30, 2017","Whenever we think of a ‘mountain flight’ in Nepal, we think of hopping on to a passenger plane at the Tribhuvan International Airport and watching the Himalayas from the comfort of your window. The pilot allows you to come into the cockpit one-by-one and you get to take photos of the highest peaks of the world in their full glory.
But there’s another way now to experience a ‘mountain flight’. Though a bit more expensive than the traditional flights, the new flight will take you closer to the mountains as well as the people who inhabit one of the remotest settlements in the world.



The adventure begins as you head to Namche, the gateway to Everest, either on foot or by flight. If you are pressed for time, you might want to fly to Lukla, but you would miss out on all the adventure a trek to Lukla entails. The ascent to Lukla is one of the most famous treks in the world, and it is one of the best ways to explore the diversity Nepal has on offer.



After setting off from Lukla on foot, you stay the night at Monjo and on the second day, you acclimatise at the picturesque Namche village. Against a clear starry night, the village comes to life as locals and tourists alike, gaze at the sky in amazement.



Until the third day of the trip, you get to see the mountains from a distance only. But that soon changes as you board a helicopter to embark on an experience of a lifetime.



During the course of the helicopter ride, you are in the cockpit for the entire duration of the flight. According to Ishwari Paudel, the Managing Director of Himalayan Guides Nepal, the company that offers the ‘new mountain flight’ package, you can see the Gokyo Lake, Mt Amadablam and other peaks during the ride. Everest remains the star attraction of the experience.



Just like the traditional mountain flights, you land in Kathmandu; there’s no need to trek all the way from Lukla or Namche to Kathmandu. This is another added advantage of the experience, says Paudel.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-new-mountain-flight-it-begins-right-from-the-heart-of-the-himalayas.html,travel
Nepal quake: Couple from ‘fallen’ village rise to challenge to put life back on track,"Friday, April 28, 2017","Ramesh Tamang was playing volleyball in a small clearing above his house in Haku village, Rasuwa when the earth started to shake. At first, he wasn’t sure what was happening. He looked in horror as the clearing split in two.
Then he heard a terrifying sound from above him.
The entire hill was falling.
“The landslide crashed down the hill, missing us, but taking out my house and an adjoining plot of land, my tea house and more than half of our village. Thankfully, no one from my family was hurt,” says Ramesh, remembering the earthquake of April 2015.

The first few days after the earthquake are a blur for Ramesh. He salvaged food items from the debris of his tea house to feed his family. “I distributed the rest in the village. It lasted two days. After that, we went hungry for a week,” he says.
His family, like many in Haku, was relocated to the Internally Displaced People (IDP) camp in Dhunchhe, Rasuwa.
“Our daughter Mahima was born here in the camp. She is seven months old,” says Karshyang, 23, Ramesh’s wife, as she looks at her two-year-old son play in front of the tarpaulin shelter that they have called home for the last two years.
Both Ramesh and Karshyang have worked as migrant labourers; Ramesh as a security guard in Malaysia and Karshyang as a domestic maid in Kuwait.
“I came back because I wasn’t making much. What I earned was barely enough to pay back my loans,” says Ramesh. He works building houses now.“If we could continue to find good work, we’d be happy to stay in Nepal,” say both in unison.
Karshyang had limited work opportunities near her camp. Along with other people in the camp, she was working to produce stone aggregate, an essential construction material. An INGO, Practical Action, stepped in to provide safety and protective gear such as glasses, gloves and hard hats to a group of women working here.
It has also provided tools like hammers and rings. As a result, their productivity and wages have gone up.
“We took turns to use available hammers before, so work was slow. Now we produce more and earn more,” says Karshyang. The programme has also helped connect the IDP camp’s aggregate to markets that need it. In the process, Karshyang’s income has gone up from Rs 150 (~$1.5) to NPR 500 ($5) per day.
The programme is supported by UK aid, which is also funding other crucial post-earthquake reconstruction efforts here. Although Karshyang’s job might seem challenging, the reality is more positive. With limited employment in Dhunche, Karshyangis now able to save money for her children’s education and to build a home.
Demand for aggregate is increasing as house reconstruction is picking up pace. She works her choice of hours, manages her own time and can take regular breaks to care for her children.
The Tamangs want to move back to Haku, but two years on, the horror of watching their home destroyed is still fresh in their memories.
Reconstruction efforts are looking to make parts of Hakusafe for resettlement so that some families can move back in and reboot their lives. But for now, Karshyang and Ramesh are putting their life back on track, one day at a time.

Travelogue: Two mountain bikers turn witch doctors at a Buddhist monastery,"Friday, April 21, 2017","
High craggy hills always fascinate me. I often gave a longing look at the Shivapuri hills, always in my sights from my house at Dhapasi, and thought about riding my mountain bike to those wooded heights located north of the Kathmandu Valley.
The big day came, and Khasing, my co-rider, and I set off to do the Nagi Gompa-Sundarijal track deep into the Shivapuri hills.
We completed the first leg of our ride at Budanilkantha, a Hindu shrine famed for the 5th-century image of Vishnu (who reclines over water, resting on a bed of coils formed by the thousand-headed snake-god, Shesh nag). The Shivapuri hills towered above us as we headed north on a sharp incline—enough to scare first-timers. Darn! the incredibly steep road never seemed to end!
We kept on stoically in between brief rests.
I sighed with relief when I spotted the Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Park gate at Muhan Pokhari. The dirt track inside the park appeared still moist with early morning dew. The forest was so thick that the sun hardly penetrated through the dense canopy as we pedalled uphill under the dappled light.


The ride was quiet save for creaks of our saddles, shifting of gears, scraping of spinning wheels, and our own breathing. Not a soul was in sight. Only the intermittent calls of birds greeted us.
The lush Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forest included pines, alders, wild Himalayan cherry, oak and rhododendron. My eyes kept straying, hoping to spot wild animals—barking deer, a flock of foraging Kalij pheasants, or an intimidating wild boar rambling idly through the forest. The Shivapuri forest is home to leopards, too, but I did not relish the prospect of seeing one of those crossing our path.
Suddenly, a crashing sound in the heavy cover startled me and I jumped on my saddle. Fearing the worst, I looked hard but soon spotted the culprits, harmless primates: rhesus monkeys.
After an hour’s uphill climb we stopped at a small clearing to catch our breath. We took in the sights. The wooded hill descended to the valley’s floor. A beautiful countryside sprawled out from the foothills. But it didn’t get far. All we could make out in the distance was
A beautiful countryside sprawled out from the foothills. But it didn’t get far. All we could make out in the distance was a mass of tiny concrete forms swathed in an impenetrable haze thickened by pollutants. The city, the distance, the future looked bleak.
Another hour brought us to a fork in the track; Nagi Gompa (a Buddhist monastery) lay uphill to our left. After a brief respite, a sip or two from our water bottles, we continued our climb.
That was the most grueling incline we had done so far. Khasing seemed to take it in his stride, but I tired soon and had to dismount. I rested a while, walked the bike a little and then somehow managed to huff and puff it to the gompa.


Built onto the hillside gradient in a split-level fashion, the monastery consists of two main temples and number of outbuildings. Painted gold and ochre, the gompas house large statues of Buddha, revered rinpoches (religious teachers revered in Tibetan Buddhism) and illustrious Karmapas (heads of the Karma Kagyu sect), while intricate Tibetan patterns, artifacts, and scroll paintings adorned the walls in splashes of vivid colors.
Set up exclusively for anis (Buddhist nuns), the nunnery housed dormitories, classrooms, and meditation chambers.
Khasing and I stopped to rest at the foreground of the lower gompa. Prayer flags festooned the monastery perimeter. They whistled in the wind, a riot of colors against the calm and idyllic surroundings. Shortly, a head-shorn plump old lady monk, dressed up in her saffron robe, approached us and uttered some words, which at first sounded like complete gibberish. As we looked at her helplessly, she repeated herself. We finally understood.
We finally understood.
As it turned out, the nun was suffering from a local malady called janai khatira, a kind of skin allergy that develops into a burning rash and mild swelling. The only known remedy for this ailment is to draw a picture of a simha (lion) on the affected part, a common practice all over Nepal. Unfortunately for the ailing lady, the nunnery had no one deft at that, so she turned to us for help.
Unfortunately for the ailing lady, the nunnery had no one deft at that, so she turned to us for help.
Frankly, I wanted no part in it; the whole idea sounded embarrassing. When a nun fetched a pen, I quickly turned her toward Khasing.
As Khasing reluctantly went to work on the bared back of the lady, I watched in silence. The allergy looked bad.
Then the ‘pick-axe’ fell!  The lady suddenly turned around, mumbling something, and bared her chest. Time seemed to freeze and so did I.
But Phasing hardly noticed! He proceeded with the drawing, the pen steady in his hand. Out of common courtesy, I looked elsewhere. After what seemed like an eternity, the ordeal was finally over.
Still reeling from the unexpected drama, we took a tour of the gompa. We watched as the anis, old and young, went solemnly about their ways.
Amidst the profound ambiance, we also observed very young nuns scampering around excitedly, giggling and whispering to each other. We also conversed briefly with some of the nuns.
Some even greeted us in Tibetan, “Tashi delek.”
We learned that Nagi Gompa (TsunGon Nang-kyi Tongsal Ling in Tibetan) housed over one hundred nuns, from 12-year-olds to 80-year-olds.
After half an hour, we continued on our way.
As we descended down to the lower gompa, drums and lavas (long-stemmed Tibetan horns) sounded from the upper gompa and the revered mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum wafted resonantly through the air, making us solemn with reverence.
But the old nun insisted on offering us tea and we had to oblige. A brief conversation followed, and we learned that the 79-year-old ‘lady’ had lived in the monastery for almost 45 years.
“What’s your name?” I asked as we sipped tea, completely unaware that the dreaded ‘pick-axe’ was about to fall for the second time.
“Maila Lama,” she replied. Did I hear it right? I wondered.
“It’s Mailee Lama, right?” I tried to correct her.
“No, no, it’s Maila and not Mailee,” she reiterated.
How on earth could a woman have a man’s name, I wondered. “But you’re a woman, right? So it should be Mailee, no?” I stood my ground.
“No, no,” she flourished a toothless grin, clearly amused.  “I’m not a woman, I’m a man. Since the gompa needed a male lama to look after the daily affairs, the management decided to consign me here.” An awkward silence settled in.
All Khasing and I did was gape at each other stupidly, in disbelief. And all the time we believed that he was a she!
“Unwind, got to unwind,” my mind screamed at me.
Khasing seemed no less pent-up.


Then, in the middle of the jungle where we stopped to eat our packed lunch, we bent double, slapped our thighs and shrieked with laughter, certainly scaring the most fearless leopard if one happened to be lurking in the nearby bushes.
The rest of the ride to Sundarijal through dense growth on a steep downhill packed an adrenaline flowing experience, the suspensions on our hardtail bikes doing extra work as we tore down the gravelly track.
Khasing and I parted our ways at the Narayan Gopal Chowk, and as I pedalled home, the weird, rather hilarious incident at the Gompa kept coming back to my mind.  I chuckled to myself. We’d had a truly memorable day indeed, I thought.

Parashuram Dham: Nepal’s holiest western frontier shrine,"Monday, April 17, 2017","
Western Nepal is home to the remotest of settlements in the country. Its waters are pristine and the forests lush green, almost everything here is in its natural state.
On the banks of the mighty Mahakali in Dadeldhura district of the far-west lies the Parashuram Dham, considered the holiest of shrines on Nepal’s western frontier.  The shrine features on various religious scriptures such as the  Manasa section of the Skanda Purana. It says the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, as a form of penance, organised a yagya (sacrifice ceremony) here after slaughtering the members of the Kshetriyas of Haihya lineage.
Legend has it that Yudhishthira also organised a similar ceremony here and built a Dharma Dwar (gate to right conduct).

A big fair is organised at the shrine on Maghe Sankranti (winter solstice), every year. The shire is also the place where the Rangun from the Mahabharat range, the Shyama from Manasarovar, the Sarayu and the Mahakali rivers meet.

On the occasion of Maghe Sankranti, 22 deities from Dadeldhura and Doti are brought here for a holy dip, according to the tradition. Devotees throng the place for a holy dip on Maghe Sankranti and on full moon nights, new moon days on days of the eclipse.
Getting there:

Parashuram Dham is just 30 kilometres away from Daiji of East-West Highway. However, a ride to the place takes around two hours from Daiji. On the way, you can spend some time at the Betkot Lake, which has been an attraction for visitors and picnickers of late.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/parashuram-dham.html,travel
New Year 2074: Nine top destinations to go on holiday,"Sunday, April 9, 2017","
Neither too hot, nor too cold, spring is the best season for travelling and Nepal celebrates its New Year in this very season. If you are confused about places to go on holiday, here are nine destinations to choose from this New Year.

Just 32 km away from Kathmandu, Nagarkot has one of the best sunrise-viewing areas in Nepal. From the hill, you can clearly see the Langtang Mountain Range and also Everest, if you the weather is clear!
Take a public bus to Kamal Binayak from Ratna Park of Kathmandu. Take another bus to Nagarkot from Kamal Binayak. You will reach Nagarkot in two hours.


It is not difficult to reach Kalinchowk, Dolakha from Kathmandu. But that does not take the charm away from Kalinchowk. Of late, scores of domestic tourists are visiting this place to enjoy the view of the mountains. You can spot Langtang and Rolwaling mountain ranges in front of your eyes in Kalinchowk. The Kalinchowk Bhagawati Temple also attracts pilgrims from all over Nepal.
Take a bus from Kathmandu to Charikot, the district headquarters. As you reach Charikot after five hours, hire a jeep for the 17-kilometre dirt road ride to Kuri. Beware that your journey to Kuri may not be easy if it is snowing. Hike uphill for around an hour from Kuri and you will reach the Kalinkchowk Bhagawati Temple.

Pokhara is Nepal’s tourism capital as it offers its guests a number of activities including sightseeing, boating, exploring caves, visiting waterfalls and trying adventurous sports. The city is a gateway to the world-famous Annapurna trekking circuit as well as Punhill and Mustang.

Alternatively, take a bus to Gamgadhi of Mugu from Surkhet via Kalikot. The bus journey along the narrow Karnali Highway takes two days. Then, walk for around three hours.

Khaptad is a one-of-a-kind gift of nature for travellers. Spread over Doti, Achham, Bajhang and Bajura districts, it is also known as the ‘heaven of far-west’. The meadows of Kaptad remain covered with snow in winter while they boast incomparable greenery on other seasons. Spring beautifies the region with various species of colourful flowers.
Dhangadhi is 650 km west of Kathmandu. Take either a bus or a plane to Dhangadhi. Take another bus for around eight hours to reach Dipayal Silgadhi of Doti. Then, begin the trek. Spend the night in Jhigrana and enter the Khaptad National Park on the second day. You can hire a jeep also.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/new-year-2074-nine-top-destinations-to-go-on-holiday.html,travel
2015 Nepal Earthquake-ravaged Langtang awakens from its deep slumber,"Wednesday, April 5, 2017","One of the villages worst affected by the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, the scenic valley of Langtang has finally awoken. Villagers mourning the passing of hundreds of friends and family are slowly, but surely rebuilding, both their houses and their own lives.
Before the quake, a small settlement in the valley, located at around 60 km northeast of Kathmandu, nestled at the foot one of the highest mountains in the world Himalayan peaks. The valley was the go-to place for hikers, bikers, climbers and anyone else remotely interested in adventure.




When the earthquake happened, Langtang was at its peak. More than 600 people are known to have been there at the time of the temblor. They were spread across the Kyanjin Gumba, in the east, and Ghodatabela. Most of the tourists were in Langtang Village. An avalanche triggered by the quake buried 116 houses. More than 300 people died, including 176 Langtang residents, 80 foreigners, and 10 army personnel.
But life in Langtang seems to have moved on. As the golden rays of the sun strike the white mountains, Langtang’s survivors look for a better day ahead. Though the villagers are yet to restructure the hamlet which they lost in the tremblor, hope is what they have not lost.



This is why the New York Times featured Langtang Region on its ’52 Places to Go in 2017. It aptly described what the valley has on offer, “In an effort to revive tourism … now offers a spectacular 15-day Tamang Heritage Trail Trek through alpine terrain, verdant midlands, rustic villages and monasteries.”



Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal General Secretary Karna Lama says Langtang’s image was tarnished in the international market as the actual loss in the earthquake was blown out of proportion, stopping many tourists likely to visit the region halfway. He says the people of Langtang are ready to welcome tourists again.

Lama and his team faced some difficulties to reach the region earlier, but all the trails now have been cleared now, he explains. TAAN and other tourism organisations have spent Rs 15 million in renovating the trekking trails, he informs.


Meanwhile, the Langtang International Marathon is being held on April 25, the second anniversary of the devastating tremor, to send a message to the international market that the valley has awoken.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/2015-nepal-earthquake-ravaged-langtang-awakens-from-its-deep-slumber.html,travel
Visiting the tiger in its lair in Baridiya National Park,"Sunday, March 19, 2017","
There it was. The mighty Royal Bengal Tiger was right in front of us as we made our way through Tinkune inside the Bardiya National Park in southern Nepal. With its two paws rested on the ground, it sat down in complete silence, looking at the camera.
I had been waiting to get a shot of a new-born tiger in the park after I found out that one more wild cat had been spotted at the park. The park’s warden Ramesh Thapa and Guide Jagat Rijal know the nook and cranny of the park, and it was within a few minutes after we reached Tinkune that we caught sight of the wonder beasts.
According to the Park, there are around 56 adult tigers in the sanctuary.

We could see two tigers interact from around a distance of 100 metres. I got what I had come for. One of the cats was the new-born I was looking for. Tigers are protective of their young ones and we were wary that the adult might attack if we go closer.
There was also a fear of a rhino attack as their numbers have soared in the park in recent times. We could even hear rhinos squabble in the horizon.

We watched the two tigers move around the jungle with grace suited to the royals of the jungle. They soon went back to the woods, and we returned to our mundane chores.

Rara: The crystal-clear lake and its different hues,"Wednesday, March 15, 2017","If there were to be a contest to choose the Queen of Lakes in Nepal, Rara would definitely make it to the top the list. Its crystal-clear water, untouched wilderness of its banks and its calm waters would easily win it the title. In addition to that, Rara, not many people know, changes its hues all the time. They say that if you sit on the banks of the lake for a long time, you get to see almost all colours of nature.
What are some of the lake’s hues? Let’s have a look:

During the Nepali New Year, which falls around April, the colour red engulfs the lake. The country’s national flower laligurans (rhododendron) is in full bloom on the banks of the river. the red stands out in the blue of the lake and the clear sky. Rays of the spring sun reflect from the deep blue and hit the red blossoms to enchant you and to leave you spell-bound.


When dusk comes, it brings with it the yellow hue. When you stand on the banks of the lake, you see the yellow ball of fire slowly hide under the gargantuan mountains. The yellow soon fades, but it whispers to you, “I’ll come again only if you promise to stay the night.”


When the yellow ball of fire is no longer visible, the sky turns gold as if someone’s just melted a thousand pots of the precious metal. The blue lake just cannot resist changing its colour, and looking at the view you wonder why you can’t stay here for eternity.


During the rainy season, gray clouds take over the sky. But they cannot take over the lake. The calm lake, however, makes them feel that they have taken over its crystal clear waters as well, for it does not want to be disturbed. But the clouds soon make way for rain and agitate the placid lake.

Not many people can imagine what the lake looks like during winter. The lake is nearly frozen and snow takes over the area. There’s nothing but white, for a long distance. The lake becomes calmer than ever and counts it days so that the blooms return to take away all the gloom!

Things to do next winter: Four reasons why ‘go visit Khaptad’ should top your list,"Friday, March 3, 2017","Vast uninhabited fields covered with cream-like snow: this is a picture that Khaptad invokes in the minds of those who have been to this natural wonder in their lifetime.
One of the important tourist attractions in Nepal’s Far-west, the Khaptad area, which is home to a national park by the same name, is also considered a holy site by Hindus. The winter season is officially over in Nepal, as we head into the New Year. Next winter, Khaptad is going to be back in its old glory.
So why go to Khaptad in winter?

The vast fields of Khaptad is filled with snow during the peak of winter season. If you live in one of the major cities in Nepal, you’d be amazed to see this amount of snow in one place. Yes, it’s an experience of a lifetime.


There are a few villages that dot the Khaptad area. Before you leave civilisation hours behind, the local people greet you with their smile and generosity. Isn’t it always wonderful to meet new people?

On a clear winter day, the sun shines bright, and the snow slowly recedes. This makes for a wonder viewing experience. While some patches of snow remain, especially under tree covers, the rest of the fields get back their original hue.

The various contours of the fields create interesting lines on the snow for photographers to capitalise on. Even if you are not a shutterbug, the lines are pleasing to the eye. You can stand on elevated land and watch the lines all day.



You take a bus from Kathmandu to Dhangadhi (650km ride), and from Dhangadi to Silgadhi (Doti). The second part of the journey takes around eight hours. You can either start your trek from Silgadhi or hop onto a jeep till Bagel. If you start from Silgadhi, you reach Jhigrana in night, where you can rest. On the second day, you can teach the national park.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/things-next-winter-four-reasons-go-visit-khaptad-top-list.html,travel
Seven reasons why Tansen is one of the must-see places in Nepal,"Monday, February 27, 2017","One of the oldest townships in western Nepal, Palpa’s Tansen is blessed with natural beauty and rich culture. The town, which was part of the ancient Sen Kingdom, came alive after Rana rulers brought Newar artisans from Kathmandu and Lalitpur to work in the city.
Many would think that the Newar community’s presence is limited to Kathmandu Valley only, but Tansen is one other place where it is thriving. The narrow alleys, which bear names like ‘Ason’, ‘Basantapur’ and ‘Makhan Tole’ are all reminiscent of t he gallis with the same names in the capital. The names give any visitor to this place clues to understanding the origins of the inhabitants of the city.
Here we look at seven reasons why Tansen is one of the must-see places in Nepal.


Tansen offers some magnificent views of the surrounding hills. The city is located south-west of Pokhara, and the Himalayas are a rare sight for anyone. But once you see the lush-green forests and the different shapes of the hills, you don’t miss the Himalayas. Everywhere you go, you want to click photos!

Palpa’s Dhaka weaves have become synonymous with the place. Although Dhaka weaves were first used only to make topis, the cloth now finds use in many many things ranging from ties to bags and kurtas. The variety of Dhaka you get in Palpa is simply mind-boggling. You are sure to be spoilt for choices!

Although much of the old settlement of Tansen has been replaced with concrete, there are a good number of traditional houses in the city that retain their old charm. A walk through the city’s Newar quarters takes you back to the heyday of the community.

Before Dhaka became popular, it was the karuwa (a traditional Nepali drinking pot) that was synonymous with Palpa. A hand-made karuwa is heavy, lustrous and shiny. Local artisans say the art is now limited to just  three houses. That makes karuwas all the more exclusive.

The town, according to local folklore, was once famous among tuberculosis patients. It is said that fresh air from the salla trees on the hills helped cure the disease. Today, the trees provide fresh air for people of major cities around Nepal who have had it with dust and smoke. Another reason to head to Tansen!

Many people would think that to travel on hilly roads, like the ones in Palpa, one would need a good sturdy SUV. But you won’t see that many SUVs on the hills. You’ll be surprised to see how this Maruti Alto treads on the treacherous road, especially outside Tansen.

At the end of a long day of walking around, there’s just the right place in Tansen to enjoy a good plate of momos. If you are from Kathmandu, you’d know what ‘Nanglo’ means for momo lovers. If you do not want to get to adventurous with the food, you could head to Nanglo for dal-bhat or that fancy chicken sizzler.
There are more than half a dozen buses, big and small, that go to Palpa from Kathmandu everyday. Just go to New Bus Park in Gongabu, and book a seat. The best time to travel is at night if you want to avoid traffic jams on the congested highway. The journey takes around 10-12 hours.
Palpali Chhen, Hotel Indreni, Hotel White Lake and Hotel Crown are some of the big names in Tansen. They offer bed and breakfast at reasonable rates. There’s also an option of ‘homestay’.

Retracing the Buddha’s steps in Nepal’s Lumbini,"Friday, February 24, 2017","In the last few decades, Lumbini has transformed into a tourist destination where every year, thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come and pay homage to Gautam Buddha, the world’s first ambassador of peace.
While Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha, has immense religious and cultural significance, the region also hosts thousands of peace-loving tourists from all over the world. Even for those looking to spend a few leisurely hours, the serenity that envelops the area makes it an ideal destination.
Lumbini boasts a major collection of pagodas and stupas from all over the world built in reverence to Lord Buddha. Each stupa os distinct in its appeal, and visitors spend most of the hours admiring their architecture. Others can be seen searching for meaning in elaborate murals, some of which cover every nook and cranny s of the walls of the pagodas.
The invaluable collection of statues, murals and artifacts related to Buddhism make Lumbini an open museum for visitors as well as scholars.


However, the most iconic architecture of Lumbini is perhaps the temple of Maya Devi. It is said that Siddhartha Gautam, who would later come to be known as Gautam Buddha, was born on the exact spot where the temple is located today.
In BC 623, when Siddhartha Gautam was born to Maya Devi, the spot was a beautiful garden, it is believed. The temple now has a statue of Maya Devi and also houses artifacts from 5th-7th century BC.
Outside, on the temple premises, the Ashok pillar stands tall beside a pond. Erected in BC 239 by emperor Ashok, the structure has a carving stating that the place is the actual birthplace of Gautam Buddha.
Situated in the southwestern plains of the country, Lumbini’s distance from major towns and cities also makes it suitable for bird-watching. Around 250 species of birds, including endangered species like the crane, are free to fly around the region.
What truly adds to the appeal of the region is the distinct charm it exudes in its amalgamation of bucolic beauty, religious significance, and varied architecture.

Lumbini is easily accessible from all parts of the country. The nearest town from Lumbini is Bhairahawa (around 20 km away) which is connected to the national highway grid making the travel relatively easy. Bhairahawa is also accessible by air.
If you are driving to Lumbini, ask the locals for the general direction towards the area once you reach Bhairahawa’s Buddha Chowk. The directions will be pretty straightforward.
For those traveling from Bhairahawa to Lumbini, a host of options ranging from taxis, rickshaws and buses are available from Buddha Chowk.


Tilaurakot
It is believed that Siddhartha Gautam spent his youth in Tilaurakot, the ancient kingdom of the Shakya clans.
Located 28 km southwest of Lumbini, the place can be easily reached by bus. From there, places like Gotihawa, Sagrahawa, Arorakot and Sisahaniya – all of which are said to places where Gautam Buddha once visited – can be reached.
Devdaha
Located at a distance of 35 km from Bhairahawa, Devdaha is the ancient kingdom of the Koliya clans. Maya Devi is said to have belonged to this region. It is also believed that Lord Buddha visited the region 7 years after his enlightenment.
Ramgram
Ramgram holds the remaining of Lord Buddha. A 7ft-tall pillar erected along the banks of Jarahi river which was once commissioned by the king of Ramgram holds the remaining. Ramgram is situated at a distance of 24 km from Bhairahawa.

There are plenty of accommodation facilities available in both Bhairahawa and Lumbini. Ranging from indulgent to basic, these facilities cater to a wide range of travelers and can cost from Rs. 1,000 – 50000 per night. Prices for luxury options can shoot up.

Gumba Danda in Eastern Nepal transforming itself as tourist destination,"Sunday, February 19, 2017","

Around 4 km away from Phungling, Taplejung’s district headquarters, lies Gumba Danda. The village, which has 90 households, gets its name from a monastery nearby.
Although Gumba Danda is not the first name which comes to mind when talking about destinations to visit in Eastern Nepal, the village’s proximity to Pathibhara, one of the most revered temples in the region has slowly transformed the area over the years.



Once a sleepy village, redolent of settlements, Gumba Danda has been gradually reinventing itself as a suitable destination for hiking.
The village opened its first homestay facility four years ago. While the number of such facilities has grown to nine, Gumba Danda still awaits visitors.



The lack of word-of-mouth publicity is the main reason behind this situation, believes Purna Kumari Gurung, Chairperson of Gumba Danda Homestay Association. After you spend some time in the village, it seems so is the case.
Located on an incline overlooking the picturesque expanse of the eastern hills, the village is well-connected via roads. The Suketar airport, around three kilometres away, also serves as an entry point into the village.



The village recently opened a museum of Gurung culture, the inhabitants of the region, and also a new monastery in anticipation of visitors.
While Gumba Danda is doing its best to welcome tourists, it is now your turn to visit them!

"Thulo Kharka aka Australian Camp, where a busy hiker meets Annapurna range","Wednesday, February 15, 2017","

Just 20 years ago, Kaski’s Thulo Kharka, an hour’s drive from Pokhara, was a grazing ground. Surrounded by verdant forests in all sides, the rolling pastures of Thulo Kharka was a fertile flatland where cows and buffaloes grazed freely.
However, after a group of Australian tourists set camp in the flatland around two decades ago, Thulo Kharka gradually reinvented itself as a tourist destination. Now, the place is known as ‘Australian Camp.’



Situated at an altitude of 2000m above the sea level, the location serves as a vantage point for observing the Annapurna range in the north. Earlier, only foreign hikers used to visit the place. In recent years, it has witnessed an influx of local tourists.
Directly benefiting from the tourists are local entrepreneurs like Tuk Bahadur Chhetri. Chhetri runs a charming lodge named Angel’s Guest House in Thulo Kharka. The lodge is one of the  four lodges operating in the area.



While Chhetri’s lodge can house up to 250 guests at any given time, the dearth of clean water in the area poses a challenge for him and other lodges. “During the peak seasons, the requirement shoots up,” says Chhetri.
But the lack of water in the area is not hindering the massive popularity Thulo Kharka aka Australian Camp has gained over the years. Located at an hour’s drive or 1.5-2 hours hike away from Pokhara, the place is not only accessible, it also serves as a solid alternative to those, who don’t have the strength or time to hike further up to the Mardi and Annapurna base camps.

What was Nepal like for Henrik Jeppesen who’s been to every country in the world?,"Sunday, February 12, 2017","
Henrik Jeppesen, a 28-year-old Danish national, has travelled to every country in the world* . He says he started his journey in 2006 when he visited Egypt, and concluded his mission by visiting Eritrea few months ago. Jeppesen was also in Nepal, the ‘100th-or-so’ country he visited for two days. Jeppesen, who went about his mission on a shoe-string budget, now wants to travel to remote territories in the world. He recently talked to Onlinekhabar over Skype on his adventure, his tips for travelling around the world on a budget, and his plans to ‘settle down.’
Excerpts:
Let’s begin with your trip to Kathmandu. How was it?
Well, I am very embarrassed I stayed in Kathmandu just for two days. I stayed at a hotel, they showed me around the city. It’s a beautiful place and the people were very hospitable and warm. That is what has left the best impression on me. The food was also interesting. But it was quite spicy for my stomach.
How did the trip to Nepal happen? Where did you come from?
I guess it was around 2012, I was just travelling, and I arrived in Bangladesh. I took a direct flight from Dhaka. Two days is just not enough to explore a country. Usually, I stay more at any place, but because of logistical reasons, I couldn’t do it. It’s not the case with countries like India where there’s a lot of tourism, and it’s easy to move around. In the future, I would like to get to Mt Everest.
But what I want to do more is to explore the culture and meet new people. I might go to Paris and see the Eiffel Tower, but what would be more exciting would be to meet new people.
How much did you spend in Kathmandu?
I didn’t spend a cent, actually. The hotel was free, the transport was free and the food was free!
How did you manage to do that?
My project was done on very little money. More than a hundred airlines and 1,200 hotels sponsored me. I just contacted them and told them about my dream, and offered them a chance to be a part of it.



Ok, now let’s get the early days of the project.
In 2005 I visited Egypt alone. I was around 17 years old then. I went back to my studies for a while after that. But since 2010, I have travelled almost every day.  I have spent over 3,000 days travelling to all the 193 UN member countries. Nepal was around 100-105th country I visited.
Which was the last country you travelled to?
The last one I travelled was Eretria. I had a local contact there. It was not very easy to get a visa there. The country has the least press freedom in the world; number two is North Korea. I spent some time there, but did not give any interviews, I maintained a low profile.
So, the other thing we wanted to talk about was your tips on travelling on a budget. How can other people follow in your footsteps?
Yes, that is what I am passionate about. I want to inspire people to travel more. It’s not that everyone needs to travel all the countries, but there are things you could do even on a limited budget. In my case, what I did was I stayed with the local people completely for free. In the early days, I did not have any hotel sponsors. If you take the local transport, it’s not very expensive. I have hitchhiked with over 1,00 cars, never been threatened. What I want to tell people is that you do not need to be rich to travel. But when you do not have the money to pay for the hotels, you need to be a little more creative, and be ready to be little uncomfortable at times. Well, there’s risk to it, but walking on the street is also risky, then.



In Nepal, there are many people, who want to travel around the world. But the visa issue is a big letdown. Do you think you had an advantage because you had Danish passport?
Yes that’s correct. I have done a lot of research on this issue. So from what I know, a Nepali passport holder can visit 38 countries without a visa or get a visa on arrival. Your passport is ranked 98th in the world. That’s not bad. It’s not zero.
Then how can we make full use of that ?
For a Nepali citizen, it is easy to go to countries like Indonesia. I know that getting a visa from the home country is very hard. But getting a visa while on the road is easier. Well, why don’t you go to Tanzania, you get a visa on arrival there. From then on, you could go to other countries in Africa. The flight to Africa would be a bit expensive, but that’s all that you’d need to be worried about.
Now tell us about yourself. Why did you decide to travel the world?
I come from Thy, a remote countryside in Denmark. When I was young, I thought I would become the parking ticket guy, and inspect cars. But watching foreign movies changed my life. My parents have not travelled much. They are part of a different culture. In our culture, people drink a lot, go out til 6 in the morning. The alcohol is not cheap. I’d rather spend the money on travelling. For the last six years, I have not been home for good. I have always been travelling. I got my driving license just a few days ago!
Well, it is very important for people to travel to understand the world. They say that the world is a book and people, who do not travel are only reading a page of the book. You need to experience a lot to understand the world. Travelling makes you a more creative person. Take my example, it gave me a bigger dream, and made me think bigger.
You said after travelling the world over, you are working on a new project. Could you please elaborate?
I want to visit some of the remotest islands in the world. There are places where ships go to every 30 years. There are many uninhabited islands in the world. I want to visit them all.
When you are done with your dream project, where do you want to settle?
I do not think I would ever want to settle down. I want to wake up every day with a great feeling.
I am single and as long as I haven’t found a girlfriend, I will definitely not settle down. I hope to find a girlfriend at some point in my travels. She’s got to be out there somewhere. She might be out there in Kathmandu, or in Russia. But when I meet here, I will think of settling down with her. But I haven’t met her so far.
You have travelled the world. What is your conclusion about people in general?
Almost all people in the world are hospitable and very friendly. You need to get out there and experience it. There may be bad people in all countries, but they make up less than 0.00001 per cent. More than 99.999 per cent of the people are good in any country. They are willing to help anyone.

Five reasons to visit Humla in five photographs,"Sunday, February 5, 2017","Despite immense potential, tourism in Humla has hardly been explored. Located in the mid-western part of Nepal, the district is remote and it hills and locales find distinction in the unique culture of its inhabitants.
On February 3, an exhibition of photographs shot at Humla began at the Nepal Tourism Board. The photographs, shot by Naresh Kusi and Geraldine Berhan, captures the region’s wild beauty and exotic culture.
Here are five reasons to visit Humla, told through five photographs.
Situated at an elevation of 4535 m above sea level, Nara La Pass connects Tibet to Nepal via rocky passes which remains blanketed in snow for many months of the year. The road to Tibet goes further up to lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash.
In the grassy flatlands of Chyakpalung, horses graze freely. A survey conducted in 2013 concluded the sightings of several rare animals in the area.
Lake Lamgyok is a bowl of pristine water most of the time until it gets frozen during winters. Nonetheless, trapped by bald hillocks at all sides, the lake is an awesome sight to soak in.
In most part of the district, the tenacity of the villagers finds a way to cut through the remoteness of the region and the many impending hardships that follow.
In sparsely populated parts of the district which are only accessible through several days of trekking, many unexplored vistas remain to be seen.

Marriott set to launch first hotel in Kathmandu next month,"Sunday, February 5, 2017","
Kathmandu, February 5
International hotel chain management company Marriott will open its first entity in Nepal next month, the company says.
Fairfield by Marriott in Thamel will be the first international brand to open in Kathmandu’s tourist district when it opens on March 15. The hotel is owned by MS Group, which has invested over Rs 1 billion in the property. “The owners of the hotel have signed a 30-year management contract with Marriott,” says General Manager Prakash Jayadevan, Marriott’s representative for the project.

Khokana: The oil capital of Kathmandu,"Sunday, January 29, 2017","Around a bend on the road, I passed a man with a bamboo pole balanced on his shoulder. Suspended from either end of the pole were two tin containers. The drip marks on them were enough to tell me they contained mustard oil. Coincidentally, I was on my way to Khokana, the medieval Newar town south of Kathmandu city that is famous for its mustard oil. In fact, if you ever inquire from a person selling mustard oil where it’s from, nine times out of ten he will tell you that it’s from Khokana. It may not be, but mustard oil sells much better when ‘Khokana’ is prefixed to it.
But it’s not mustard oil or mustard plants you notice most in Khokana. It’s duck. They are in the streets sunning themselves or drinking from a puddle. They block the street as they waddle lordly by. Their quacks fill small squares and narrow alleys. Judging from the numbers and ubiquity of ducks, Khokana could be famous for free-range ducks.
Khokana is a village (‘town’ if the predominance of concrete houses qualifies it as such) where things happen in the open. Men and women spend time either in the main squares or hang out in their doorways. Laundry is done there too. Women spin cloth in front of doorways. Corn stalks and hay stacks lean against facades. Near Rudrayini Temple, the center of the village, there is a wooden post with a glass and wood oil lamp holder hanging from it. The village seems decades behind Kathmandu.


That illusion is broken at the Jitapur Mandap. Three cars and a couple of motorbikes were parked right next to the single story oven pavilion, newly reconstructed after the earthquake. The western side of the square was the façade of a long classic Newar house. Running the length of the northern side of the square was a building whose roof and top story were Newar style. The second story had a white plaster façade and jalousie windows that recalled Rana houses. Its main door was a corrugated tin shutter. Nearby an old house that had been severely damaged by the earthquake was being demolished. Khokana was a medieval village, but it was evolving by the minute, brick by brick.
Anyone who goes to Khokana expecting ancient Newar architecture will be disappointed: concrete buildings outnumber traditional houses. But there is enough consolation (and beauty) down the hill from the village. Fields with white plastic fencing to keep out goats and sheep stretched away into the distance. Transmission towers rose from the landscape like steel trees. Looking toward Kathmandu you could see a cluster of concrete buildings and a chimney spewing black smoke.


Footpaths snaked through the fields, each one ending in a dun farmhouse. Some of them were torn asunder, others badly cracked—the doings of 2015’s earthquake. The sky was bluer. Large eagles rested on trees, awaiting updrafts. Men and women were bent over, tending vegetable plots. The yellow of mustard was nowhere to be seen. Even without it the fields were a haven: quiet, no roads, no vehicles and no pollution. They were a slice of Kathmandu’s agrarian past. The predominant smell was of tilled earth, birds were many and loud and every photo you took had at least one plant, dead or alive, in the frame.
I saved a visit to Khokana’s famed mustard oil mills for last. I walked into the Khokana Gabu Jyaasha Oil Mill. A man with a big curly tipped mustache was seated on a low stool: Kanchha Maharjan. He had leased the mill, which was jointly owned by the neighborhood—144 people. Maharjan told me the mill had been in operation for over four centuries. It burned down in the 1934 earthquake.
Judda Sumsher Rana paid for its rebuilding. As he talked, another man worked with the pressed seed cakes, or peena. A tendril of smoke curled up from the wood-fired roaster. Beside it was the old wooden oil press: two huge wooden beams that were squeezed tight by turning a wooden wheel. The oil flowed out into a container at the bottom of a small pit below the press.



Maharjan confessed the mill’s glory days were long gone. No one in Khokana grew mustard anymore; less and less farmers in the Valley grew it. All the money was in growing vegetables. Maharjan bought most of his mustard seeds from Chitwan. He even bought ones imported from Australia and Ukraine.
The latter, he said, did not have any fragrance. And fragrance (“fragrance, not odor”) was what he said made Khokana oil what it was. Also, it has a reddish color. He shrugged when I asked him if the mill had a future in the face of plummeting mustard production in Nepal. I think he knew genuine Khokana mustard oil would soon be history. It’s uncertain whether Khokana’s oil mills (there are four) have a future. But the village’s famous produce has such a reputation that as long as there is even one man walking Kathmandu’s neighborhoods with containers suspended from a bamboo pole slung over his shoulders, he will claim it’s from Khokana.


Take the road to Bhaisipati, the one that goes straight (south) across Nakkhu Pul. A kilometer or so after the big antenna, take a right where it says ‘road to Karyabinayak.’ Follow the road downhill until you arrive at a big tree. Turn right. Khokana’s main entrance gate is fifty meters from the tree.


The road on the left of the big tree goes to Karyabinayak. This is one of Kathmandu’s most sacred Ganesh temples. Half a kilometer south on the same road is Bungamati. The famous Rato Machhendranath Temple is in this village. Though it’s under construction after suffering major damages in the earthquake, it’s well worth a visit.

Kalinchowk: Thrill of snow for the non-risktakers,"Wednesday, January 25, 2017","
Well, the winters season is about to end in Nepal, and it is time for the spring season to set in. The season now offers one last chance for those interested in ‘playing’ with snow.
Of the many places you could visit to see snowfall, Kalinchowk , around 149 North-east of Kathmandu, is the one of the safest for anyone who is in no mood to take risks.
A short hike away from Kuri lies the temple of Kalinchok (4000m). This temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess of Kali, stands at the top of the hill at the valley’s northwest end and stands firmly in the midst of eerie silence that is only perturbed by the occasional wind passing through the area. The hike to the temple complex will cover a stretch of 5 km.



You can choose to either walk or board a local vehicle to reach the top of the hill. If you are in a hurry, take the vehicle, but if you want to soak in the scenery, then go for the walk.
If you stick to the prominent trails and avoid venturing too deep into the woods, there are some serene spots where you can enjoy your solitude. The forest northeast of the hamlet, on the dirt road that goes to the next village, is worth a visit.

You will also pass by the stone stupa-like commemorative structures built by the locals in memory of their ancestors. Brave winter’s freezing mornings to rise early to arrive there, and you will be rewarded with an unforgettable sunrise.


At the end of the visit, you have a camera filled with wonderful photos, and a memory of a lifetime!

In photos: Encounter with the Royal Bengal Tiger in Nepal’s woods,"Monday, January 23, 2017","It is often said that the number of tigers in a forest indicates to the overall health of its ecosystem. Any decline in tiger population is a sign that the natural ecosystem is in trouble.
Thankfully, the tiger population all over the world is on the rise, thanks to the collaborations between various agencies. According to a data released in 2013, the total number of Royal Bengal Tigers, the species found in South Asia, in Nepal stands at 198. The figure stood at 63 per cent in  in 2009.
The number is expected to grow more after the latest tiger census, which began earlier this year.
In Nepal, Chitwan National Park is home to the largest number of tigers. While hard to spot on the jeep tracks frequented by guards and tourists, a total of 120 Bengal tigers call the national park home.
As winter began to intensify, photographer Sagar Giri set out to on a mission to photograph the beasts in their natural habitat. It took him 10 days to come close to one.
“I’d start early at 6 am and roam the jungle till 6 pm.” says Giri. “But I could not find a single tiger!”
All that changed on the sixth day.

“It was around 5 pm in the evening. We were waiting.  Around 1 km away, I saw  a small ‘dot’ move, I just looked through my binoculars and jumped up with excitement. In a hushed voice, I said ‘tiger’ to my driver. So I asked my him to drive towards the wild cat, and after a few seconds the tiger disappeared into the bush.”
“I felt a sensation rush trough my body. All the fatigue from those long days was gone.”

“It was only after four more days of roaming the jungle, that I spotted a tiger again.”
“It was getting dark. My nose picked up a strange smell, and I knew it was that of a tiger.”
“I asked my driver to stop, and I looked around with my binoculars. There it was looking at me from behind the bus
vehicle and checked around with my Binocular and there he was watching me from the bush.”
“This time, I got to look at him for over an hour. The sun was setting, and the light was getting poor. But he didn’t seem to mind.”

“I took a lot of photos. I could not stop looking at the magnificent beast.”

Winter in Nepal: Four places to go to play with snow!,"Sunday, January 22, 2017","A snowy landscape has an appeal that is hard to pin down. Is it the sense of uniformity that a place covered in a single color gives? Or perhaps the blanketing of the terrain by snow makes the landscape serene? Maybe it’s the emptiness: plants disappear; man and animals don’t venture out much.
But snow stirs emotions (or memories) in us that are hidden at other times. Some of us become playful when there is snow around. Here are some destinations that particularly appealing under the cover of snow.


This is one of the few places (Shivapuri is the other) in the Kathmandu Valley that gets snow, although a miniscule amount. Snow remains on the northern side of the hill for a couple of days after snowfall. That gives ample time for Kathmanduites to rush to the hill to cavort in the snow. Snow only adds to the charms of this wilderness. The densely forested hill offers a wonderful day’s hike, with possible sightings of wildlife. Birdwatching is a rewarding experience here, with Nepal’s only endemic species, the Spiny Babbler, a resident here.


Kalinchok after a snowfall is a lovely sight. Each wooden hut emits a plume of smoke, and the only colors are the yellow of the wood and the fluttering prayer flags in the middle of the village. The hill with the Kalinchok Bhagwati’s shrine towers over the tiny settlement. Hills surround the village on all sides, and under the cover of snow their slopes are irresistible. Clambering up the hill is not only done to slide down again; the scenery from the top is stunning.



Unlike other, wilder destinations that receive ample snow, Kalinchok offers thrills at relatively lower risks. You would have to be pretty reckless and suicidal to lose your way in and around Kalinchok. If you stick to the prominent trails and avoid venturing too deep into the woods, there are some serene spots where you can enjoy your solitude. The forest northeast of the hamlet, on the dirt road that goes to the next village, is worth a visit.

You will also pass by the stone stupa-like commemorative structures built by the locals in memory of their ancestors. Brave winter’s freezing mornings to rise early to arrive there, and you will be rewarded with an unforgettable sunrise. The spot is equally good to visit in the afternoons, especially if you are the kind that likes to sit in the sun for a while and do nothing but stare at the silhouette of trees and clouds moving across Himalayan peaks.


This is on almost every trekker’s bucket list, but rarely for the snow. In autumn and spring, Poon Hill becomes almost a pilgrimage site for trekkers, who come in their hundreds to shudder in the pre-dawn cold as they wait for the morning light to gild the mountains. When there is snow on the ground, this trek becomes a little risky, but it becomes significantly more enjoyable.

The trail is covered in snow for the last third of the trek to Ghorepani, the village at the base of Poon Hill. Like in the trekking season, the highlight of the trip is standing at Poon Hill, surrounded by magnificent peaks. The difference of going in winter is you are likely to feel the iciness of the mountains on your face as a snow missile from your buddy finds its mark.


Khaptad National Park is a place of otherworldly quiet. A couple of hundred Nepal Army soldiers and a dozen or so park staffers live here year round. In winter, when sometimes seven to nine feet of snow falls, the place is virtually cut off from the world. Khaptad’s beauty is overwhelming, but getting there, especially in winter, is not easy.

In the spring and autumn, it is a two-day – two long, arduous days – hike from Silgadi, the district headquarters of Doti. It’s almost impossible to get in during peak winter; to see snow, but without risking your life, you need to go either just as winter is setting in (late November) or toward winter’s end (February-March).



Logistics is also an issue here. There are no hotels or teahouses in Khaptad, so you need to somehow arrange to stay either at the army barracks or at the park employees’ quarters. Khaptad is arguably the wildest place in Nepal. This means beauty and danger in equal measure. You can saunter half a kilometer beyond the barracks in any direction and arrive in a place that is a century behind where you have come from. Wander away from the prominent trails and you could lose your way within minutes in the dense forests.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/winter-nepal-four-places-go-play-snow.html,travel
New 7-day Dhaulagiri trek: Three reasons to hit the trail,"Monday, January 16, 2017","
A new trekking route to Dhaulagiri-I Base Camp was recently identified, and this means that you can reach there in seven days, a duration relatively shorter than the 21-day adventure trekkers usually associate with the mountain.
You begin your journey from from Beni in Myagdi go through Jhi, Pakha Pani, Rai Khor, Ghyasi Kharka, Chari, Fedi, Sahasra Bhir and Odar Camp before reaching the southern base camp of Dhaulagiri-I.
The seven-day trek has the potential to become popular with tourists, believes Pawan Shakya, managing director of Himalayan Map House. It was Shakya who came up with the route.
In February 2016, Shakya had led an expedition to chart out possible alternative routes for trekkers in the region. The work was a collaboration between Myagdi Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Nepal Tourism Board, Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and Non-Resident Nepali Association, Myagdi among others.
Located at an altitude of 4000 m, the route was developed after following a trail frequented by hunters and herders.
Although the trip is short, you are not short-changed for adventure, for sure. Here we look at three major highlights of the the new route.
Getting up and close with Dhaulagiri gives you the opportunity to witness the different hues of the mountain. While the rays of the early morning sun lend it a golden hue, it turns white as the day progresses. Then when the sun slowly slides, the gold is back again!
Magar people, and their living culture is an important part of the Dhaulagiri experience. While you stay at one of the homestays, enjoy the delicacies your local host prepares, and then get ready for some authentic music. The Magars have a unique culture, and are known for their hospitality.
While you may be enchanted by the snow-capped mountains you encounter on the way to Base Camp, the foot journey itself is no less exciting. You pass through suspension bridges, swift-flowing rivers and lush green fields. This makes the seven days you are on the trail quite memorable !

"Begnas to Thulakot: Close to mountains, just far enough from everything","Sunday, January 15, 2017","Somewhere behind the hills girdling the lake there was a village that had stunning views of the mountains we could see in the distance. I heard that from a man who lived near the lake. He told us it was half a day’s hike to that village. I figured a place had got to be pretty if someone who lived on the Begnas recommended it.
Also I had begun to get bored with walking along the lake. So I found myself climbing up a steep trail into a forest of sal trees.
The trees were of uniform thickness; underfoot, there was a carpet of russet leaves. A trail wove through like the marks left behind by a giant serpent. I went deeper into the forest, my footsteps sounding like the chewing of cornflakes. Then an explosive beating of wings.
Khalij pheasants scuttled away, frightened out of their wits. After the second or two that took for me to recover from the sudden fluttering, I began walking again. Khalij were a good sign. I was in a wild place—or at least some place less urban.
Around the next corner, however, I lost the trail. To got an idea of my location, I clambered up a hillock. In the distance, tucked in a fold between hills, was a small pond. It was surrounded by a moss-coloured bog. It looked like the pond was on the verge of seeping completely into the earth.
Soon, a local appeared with his buffaloes. He guided me to the trail toward Thulakot, my destination.



I walked for about ten minutes and came to a paved road. A dirt bike zoomed by. The bike’s muffler had been removed, and its raucous sound bit into the ears. When I was told that I had to continue down the paved road for a while, I began to doubt if Thulakot was worth the hike. Even though I had done it several times, suddenly watching kingfishers and eagles, fishermen and the fish market seemed more worthwhile.
The banks of the lake, even when I had sauntered along it three to four times already, seemed a better walk than a paved road with screaming dirt bikes on it.
It turned out that I needed to be on the dirt road for less than a kilometer. Then I turned onto a flight of stone steps – Gurung escalator as one friend calls them – toward another hill.
The cluttered world with its various pollution and excesses seemed to fall away with every step. Eagles wheeled in the deep blue sky. More mountains appeared on the horizon. The sun’s rays began to prick like needles.
***
I climbed up a corkscrew trail into a pine forest. A shadow glided over us—a large vulture. It seemed like spooking khalij was a ritual before entering a forest: a flock of them glided into the bushy slope. The forest had laid out a banquet of golden Himalayan raspberries. I stuffed myself greedily.
Before I knew it, I was at a small shrine. A village was visible on a nearby hill—Thulakot. Egyptian vultures were gliding by low, as if on a reconnaissance mission.
There was nothing special about Thulakot.
Tourism nourishes, but it also disfigures: a place needs to be nondescript to save its soul. Thulakot was safe from that kind of onslaught. It had splendid mountain views. There was a tree that, according to a signboard, was five centuries old. Other than that it was nothing but a village on a hill.
The mountains you saw from there were the same ones you could see from Pokhara, although they were much closer. But it was not about getting closer to the mountains; it was about increasing your distance from the clangour of the world.


Thulakot is (for slow walkers) a five hour hike from Begnas Tal. Walk along the southern shore of Begnas, then follow the shore as it curves north. You will come to a small village. Ask the locals there for the trail to Thulakot. There are multiple trails in some places after that. Remember to keep going north. There are no indicators on the trail to direct you toward Thulakot, so when you ask locals for directions ask them for specific landmarks to help you stay on the right path.


You will be relying on the hospitality of locals when in Thulakot. Some of the houses were damaged during the 2015 earthquake, so there might be a problem to find accommodation for large groups. If you are the kind of hiker who must have a clean and comfortable bed at the end of the day, you are likely to be disappointed.
For those who can rough it, the village will have a spare mattress or two for sure.
There are hotels galore in Begnas. Grand Hotel Begnas (061-561129; Begnas Sadak, Lekhnath), located at a stone’s throw away from the lake, has clean, spacious rooms at affordable prices. There are several small, family-run hotels on the hill on the western corner of the lake.

Begnas Tal is the older version of Phewa Tal. The water is cleaner, the setting still rustic, and the number of visitors low enough to feel like being in a village rather than a tourist destination. Boating is a much more serene affair here. Take a boat to the northern shore, which only has a couple of houses in the name of habitation. Early morning or late evening boat rides are especially enjoyable.
If you are not into hiking half a day up a hill to get to Thulakot, you can sample the wilderness, the birdlife and the quiet by taking a walk along the lake’s shore. A longer walk (or a short bus ride) east from the small Begnas bazaar toward Rupa Tal has some spots with panoramic views of the mountains.

"Dhampus: Escape from Pokhara, without leaving it!","Thursday, January 12, 2017","There aren’t many places near Pokhara that can give you a feeling of wilderness like Dhampus.
Located around 25 km north-west from the Lake City, the walk to Dhampus is moderate. And unlike the Annapurna trail, you walk on low elevation. This makes the trail accesible to almost anyone with enthusiasm and zeal.
You begin your journey in Pokhara from where you drive to Phedi, from where the hike starts. Although the first few minutes challenge you with a steep climb, the terrain gets easier as you continue out of the woods. You reach Dhampus in around three hours, but it would take the locals far less time.
You know you have reached Dhampus when the majestic Machhapuchhre and the Annapurnas smile at you and you are greeted with beautiful stone houses, millet fields, lodges, and restaurants.
Highlights of the trip:


Although there are many reasons why you would want to spend a weekend in Dhampus, the magnificent view of the Machhapuchhre would  top the list. You get up-close with the ‘Fishtail’ mountain like you’ve never before.
As the sun sets, the golden hues illuminate he snow-white mountains and the yellow ball of fire hides behind the Himalayas until it can come back again next morning.


After you have soaked in the views of the Himalayas and the surrounding areas, take a stroll around. Or you can spend a day lazying around in the village. Dhampus’s traditional architecture have stood the test of time, and  welcome guests from all over the world.


But all the effort would not be worthwhile if Dhampus was anything short of stunning. The village is beautiful at all times of the day and wears a distinct vibe depending on when you observe it.
If you stay long enough or reach before sunrise, you can witness the sunrise above the Fishtail. As the golden rays of the sun reach the earth, you get refreshed and thankful to be alive.



So when are you going to Dhampus?

"‘World’s first’ travel blogger Greenwald: In Nepal every day brings a new, unexpected discovery","Sunday, January 8, 2017","
Anyone who can do a monologue entitled “Strange Travel Suggestions” for years has seen a lot of the world. Jeff Greenwald is that traveler.
He has done some pretty amazing things in his travels: creating the world’s first travel blog (1994), crossing oceans on a container ship, rescuing a snow leopard cub in Tibet. He first came to Nepal in 1979, and has been hooked ever since. He has written extensively about Nepal in Mister Raja’s Neighborhood: Letters from Nepal, Shopping for Buddhas, and Snake Lake.
Kapil Bisht asked the seasoned travel writer about his love for travel, his favorite destinations and the things that keep him at home.
How did you get started on traveling?
I took my very first (and very short) trip to Europe right out of high school. That was three weeks. But my first real journey—an accidental nine-month odyssey around the world—began in 1979. I was working as a visual artist in Europe, and met a young woman doctor who was on her way to study Ayurvedic medicine in Nepal. I eventually joined her in Kathmandu (on a ticket that first took me to Cairo and Bombay), and fell in love with the country. From there I continued on to Thailand, then home to California.
How did you get started writing?
Writing has always been a central part of my life. One of my earliest memories is of winning a local writing contest for kids—when I was eight! Then, when I was 15, I met the great science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, and he encouraged me to pursue the craft.
You once said that “Airports are the great, bland equalizers of civilization; arriving in every new country, from Turkey to Thailand, felt exactly the same.” So what is your preferred means of transportation? What does it provide that air travel cannot?
Nothing compares to approaching a new continent by sea, and smelling the place before you can even see it. You get a sense that you’ve earned the right to be there, having gotten there the long way—as all the early explorers did. I wrote about this feeling in my 1995 book, The Size of the World: how amazing it was to arrive in Senegal, Africa, on a container ship.
For a country like Nepal, of course, this wouldn’t work! It’s wonderful (but a bit bone-jarring) to come to Nepal by land, but these days I love approaching the Valley by air, and being able to see the mountains as we land.
What kind of places are you drawn to as a traveler and writer?
I love visiting places where there’s art, ritual and music—preferably right out on the streets—and where people have a strong political awareness as well as a sense of humour. Many Nepalis are very well-read, but also have a wonderful, sometimes dark sense of humour that always makes me feel at home. That’s one of the reasons I was so drawn to Nepal, and why I’ve grown to love Cuba.
You described Nepal in 1990 as a “country poised hopefully and uncertainly on the cusp of major changes—changes that will conceivably alter all our preconceptions.” Do you think the changes that have happened since 1990 have lived up to the expectations of those days?
Well, there have been changes, all right. But I have to say (and I know many Nepalis agree) that the 1990 Jana Andolan did not bear the kind of fruit we all hoped. There have been some real improvements, like increased freedom of the press and – at least on paper – greater rights for women and groups like the Dalits. But there’s no doubt that corruption and infighting are major forces in Nepal right now, to the cost of the country’s people. The great unifying symbol that King Birendra provided has been lost, and it’s hard to see what will replace it.
In describing Cuba’s potential in one of your blog posts, you have mentioned the “naivete and childish dependency of the Nepalese.” Can you elaborate on this impression of Nepal?
Centuries of top-down management and development aid created what the great Nepali journalist and firebrand Mahesh Regmi (along with others) called a culture of dependency in Nepal.
It’s been well articulated in books like Kunda Dixit’s Bikash-Binash, the columns of the late Barbara Adams and many others. The notion that outside forces—including cunning, self-interested parties like China and India—will step in to kindly solve Nepal’s problems has misled, disappointed and oppressed generations of Nepalis.

Interestingly, I found that the earthquakes of 2015 began to overturn this bad habit. Many Nepalis, from the middle hills to the Khumbu, took the incentive and began rebuilding their lives without the help of the bickering, ineffectual central government.
You have often called Nepal your second home. What do you like most about this country?
Yes. From the first day I arrived, in the monsoon of 1979, I felt I had come home. Some reasons are obvious: the magnificent architecture, the geography, the generosity of the villagers, the beauty of the people. The almost tangible current of devotion among the Hindu, Buddhist and Vajrayana traditions. The wisdom of the elders, and the activism of the younger generation. Drums and harmoniums on the Chhetrapati bandstand at night, and the fusion bands at Jazzmandu.
I’m still captivated by the endlessly fascinating rituals and stories, which I tried to capture in books like Mister Raja’s Neighborhood, Shopping for Buddhas and Snake Lake. But especially—for me—there’s the fact that every day brings a new, unexpected discovery. I’m endlessly grateful for having stumbled upon one of the most complex, profound and beautiful cultures in the world.
What are the things that irk you most about Nepal?
The widespread notion that a family or clan’s responsibility for their community stops at their front gate. There’s a phrase for it: “the tragedy of the commons.” It means a situation where people exploit shared community resources—like waterways and forests, open spaces and even the air—for their self-interest. Often, it seems like anyone with any power in Nepal is in for themselves.

There are nearly a million vehicles on the roads, and sewage is pumped into the rivers. People throw garbage over their walls. Public spaces are sold to the highest bidder, then horribly developed or plastered with awful billboards. The only way for Nepal to survive is for all its ethnic groups—from the Tharu to the Sherpas—to unite with shared goals: Celebrating Nepal’s diversity, providing basic rights and necessities for all, and conserving the country’s natural and cultural resources.
When we think travel writer, we envision constant movement. What plays the role of an anchor in your life?
I’m very fond of my community of friends (and godchildren!) in Oakland, California, and I’ll never abandon this place. But on a more abstract level, I’d say my anchor is my writing. As long as I have a journal with me (and I often use an AlphaSmart NEO as my journal) I feel grounded.
Your favorite travel books?
I read very few actual travel books, though I read quite a few non-fiction books (and some novels) set in exotic locales. Lately I’ve devoured Mary Roach’s Grunt, Jon Mooallem’s Wild Ones, Wendy Simmons’ My Holiday in North Korea, Jenny Williams’ soon-to-be-released novel The Atlas of Forgotten Places, and the wonderful Atlas Obscura. I read a lot of contemporary science fiction, as well.
Your favourite book on Nepal?
There are so many. But my favorites are probably the classic Nepali Aama by Broughton Coburn, Rhythms of a Himalayan Village by Hugh Downs Jr., and the more contemporary works of Manjushree Thapa and Samrat Upadhyay as well as the poet Yuyutsu Sharma.
If you were to recommend only one book of yours, which one would it be and why?
My most popular book is Shopping for Buddhas, and that’s always a good place to start. But my personal favorite is The Size of the World, in which I circled the world without airplanes at the dawn of the Internet era, and created the world’s first travel blog (in January 1994). Sadly, that book is no longer in print. For Nepalis with a political interest, Snake Lake is set during the 1990 Jana Andolan and receives high marks from local readers.
What makes Nepal special as a travel destination?
I could say the mountains, the temples, the festivals, the culture, the artwork, even the food—but to tell you the truth, it all comes down to the people. The Nepali people are among the warmest, most generous, best-humored and engaging people in the world. My only wish is that somehow, someday, you elect the enlightened and unifying leadership you deserve.

A 7-day trek to Dhaulagiri-I base camp now possible,"Friday, January 6, 2017","
A new trekking route to the Dhaulagiri-I base camp has been identified.
The 7-day trek will start from Beni in Myagdi and will continue via Jhi, Pakha Pani, Rai Khor, Ghyasi Kharka, Chari, Fedi, Sahasra Bhir and Odar Camp before reaching the southern base camp of Dhaulagiri-I.
The relatively short trek of 7 days has the potential to be popular with tourists, believes Pawan Shakya, managing director of Himalayan Map House. Shakya is also the responsible for the exploration of the route.
In February 2016, Shakya had led an expedition team consisting of experts to chart out possible routes for a trek in the region.

Three reasons why Daman is the hottest destination this winter,"Wednesday, January 4, 2017","Located just around 75 km southwest of Kathmandu, Daman is beautiful throughout the year, it is more so during winter when the tiny village spring backs to life from its summer slumber.
As Daman’s slopes get coated with snow, travellers from the neigbouring districts come here to enjoy a rarity in the Kathmandu valley–snow.
But there are more reasons to visit Daman this winter, than just to play in the snow.


With a few luxury resorts and several lodges and homestay facilities available for accommodation, a stay on the hill can be tailored to your budget and taste.
Many shared 4WD and local buses leave for Daman from Kathmandu and from other neighbouring cities like Hetauda, Chitwan and Birgunj. For those in Kathmandu, an alternative off-road route via Chitlang is also doable.

After you have soaked in the views of the Himalayas and the surrounding areas, take a stroll around. Or hire a mountain bike or a cycle. You can reach Daman from Chitlang via Kulekhani, Tistung and Palung.
Or you can spend a day lazying around in village. Daman falls inside Thaha municipality which also includes the valleys of Tistung and Palung where homestay facilities are available.
For the religious, the region is also home to the temple of Risheshowr.


But all the effort would not be worthwhile if Daman was anything short of stunning. The village is beautiful at all times of the day and wears a distinct vibe depending on when you observe it.


The only commonality is the relaxing unwinding of the time.
This is a godsend, especially for the city dwellers.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/three-reasons-daman-hottest-destination-winter.html,travel
Pokhara Ultralight: Your aerial adventure in the Lake City,"Monday, January 2, 2017","It was in 1996 that the first commercial ultralight service was launched in Pokhara. The service was an addition to the long list of many ‘touristy’ things to do at one of Nepal’s most famous holiday destinations.
Unlike today, it was mostly foreigners who enjoyed riding among the clouds above the seven lakes of the city. The main reason was the service did not come cheap. But now, 25 out of every 100 people boarding the planes are Nepalis, says Rijan Rijal, manager of Avia Club, one of the first ultralight companies in the Lake City.


There are three companies that can fly over Pokhara. The flight, which lasts for anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour-and-a-half, offers a unique perspective on the valley below.
With the sky as your vantage point, you not only get to see he vistas of the mighty Himalayas, but also the placid and serene lakes. Compared to a ‘mountain flight’ operated by commercial airlines, an ultraflight is more personal, and offers a tailor-made experience.



While the services has come a long way since its inception, Rijal says that there is an immediate need for state-run programs to attract more visitors to the region.


“For the first two years, we operated the service free of cost,” says Rijal.
It was done to make the travel agencies and government bodies understand the nature and prospect of the services, adds Rijal.
The ticket price now is between Rs 7,500- Rs 33,500, depending on the duration of the flight.


In a city, which has immense potential for tourism, the list of attractions and activities are still limited. The success of the ultralight brings to fore the need to explore other ventures.

While doing so, Pokhara and the government of Nepal should understand the ground realities, and not get carried away!

Four hand-picked places to soak up the New Year sun in Kathmandu,"Friday, December 30, 2016","Whenever we talk about going out on the first day of the New Year, we think about a jet ride to destinations far away, or a quick trip to Pokhara. Those who do not think along those lines, plan to go to Chitwan to spend time with friends and family, and the ones ‘left’ in Kathmandu remain at home watching the telly.
But with beautiful weather blessing the Valley this New Year, there are places you could visit during the day to soak up the sun. These places are not far away from the city, but once you are there, you feel you have left Kathmandu far far away. Here we look at four places to spend January 1 this year:

Located in Bhaktapur, the ‘pokhari’ provides some excellent views of the Himalayas. As you enjoy the sun, you can feed the fish in the pond, or take to a corner and read your favorite book. The place is usually quiet, and remains open till late in the afternoon.
The Bouddhanath Stupa, damaged by the 2015 quake, has just been restored to its glory. You can spend an entire day at Bouddhanath, sipping hot chocolate, watching people (and pigeons) get on with their lives. The Stupa square is abuzz with tourists, and pilgrims.

Located in the north-eastern part of the Kathmandu Valley, Jamacho Monastery, on Nagarjun Hill provides some  stunning vistas of the Himalayas. Although visibility is low in the valley during the winter season, the view tower’s altitude compensates for it. The walk from Fulbari Gate, near Balaju Bypass, to Jamacho takes around three hours. The area is guarded by the Nepali Army, and you need to present your ID to get in.
Patan is fast emerging as the Valley’s cultural hub. There are excellent eateries, both traditional and modern, museums and historical palaces to visit. When the sun is out in its full glory, there is no other place in the Valley that is better than Patan, to sit down and listen to the sounds of the city.

Heading to Pokhara this new year? Here are 8 activities that shouldn’t be missed,"Thursday, December 29, 2016","A couple of kilometers before you enter Pokhara there is an area where small plateaus rise from the banks of the Seti River.
They are crowned with grass. Their walls are bare and rocks protrude from them. They are the remains of a massive avalanche that careened down from the Annapurna Range into what is the modern day Pokhara. It leveled the landscape as it went, creating the valley that is Pokhara. Much later, a lake – Phewa Tal – formed.
Without this geological background, Pokhara looks more the work of a landscape artist on a massive scale: a lake, forested hills around it and beyond them mountains. There is also an ever-growing city in the midst of all this. But Pokhara does not force its urbanity on you. Its city features stay on the sidelines; you only go to them whenever you want to.
Everywhere else, there is always a little further, higher, and deeper to go. Walk out of the town long enough and you arrive in the countryside. Climb a little and you can gaze at the girdle of the Himalayan peaks. Or you can enter the dark and dank subterranean realm of its many caves. Here are some of the choices on offer in Pokhara, a city that plays the perfect host to visitors of all shades.

Boating on the Phewa Tal is almost a cliché. Neither is being surrounded by dozens of other boats much fun. But get your boatman to take you further out to the lake, beyond the area in the vicinity of Barahi Temple, and you will have a quiet stretch of water to admire the landscape from.
There is a buffer zone of parks between the febrile atmosphere of Lakeside and Phewa. A walk in these parks sometimes comes with unexpected bird sightings, like Egyptian vultures. A trail also hugs the shoreline. This is a vibrant corridor of local life: artists sit painting the lakes and hills, fishermen weave nets, Tibetan women sit behind their display of trinkets, kids play football and men repair old boats. Walk past the western end of Lakeside and a kilometer or so later you will be in a relatively unspoiled part of the lake. You can sit on the shore watching fishermen cast nets into the water and see waterbirds that have learned to stay away from parts of the lake where humans tend to congregate.
Lovers of long walks can try the Phewa Tal circuit, which begins at the trail to the World Peace Pagoda, then continues to Lukunswara. From there, take the right fork on the trail, which will take you to Pumdi. Ask locals in Pumdi for the way to Margi. Continue on to Pame Bazaar, where you can cross the lake on a bridge. After that either walk into Pokhara or take the occasional bus.
You hear the roar, then you feel the misty spray on your face. Though not as loud and voluminous in the dry seasons, the sight of white, foaming water hurtling down into a dark chasm strikes both awe and fear.

The Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave is across the road from Devi’s Falls. It’s a sacred place for Hindus as it contains a large stalagmite that is worshiped as a Shiva lingam. The highlight of this cave (if you are not there for religious reasons) is the sight of the waters of Devi’s Falls falling down through a cleft in the cave wall.
Another cave in Pokhara worth visiting is the Bat Cave. As the name suggests, this cave is home to bats, hundreds of them, which only add to the spookiness of the cavern. The most fun part of the cave is the exit, which is a narrow chute through which you need to wriggle to see the light of day.


Pokhara is not all about a lake and caves and mountain views. Before it was a destination for paragliding or spending weekends, it was a trading town on the Nepal-Tibet trade route. That mercantile past lives on, although in the shadows, in the old part of the town.
Remnants of that era stand on the road that goes northeast from Lakeside to the Bindhya Basini Temple. After walking through an area of distastefully similar concrete houses you suddenly find yourself in front of large Newar-style houses. There aren’t that many of these old houses, so the remainder of the walk to Bindhya Basini Temple is not the most enjoyable. But the temple itself is perched on a small hillock. On a clear day, the mountains look close enough to touch.

There is a pervasive sense of loss in Pokhara’s Tibetan refugee settlements.
Its residents have lost their homeland but the villages stand as much for continuation. The Tibetans have kept their faith and inner life intact; they have fought many odds to establish themselves in a foreign land. These camps are nothing special, nothing spectacular. They don’t resemble Tibet and the inhabitants aren’t dressed like Tibetans. But then you see two huge goats saunter from door to door and get fed by old men and women. When you ask about the goats, you come to know that the entire community pitched in to buy them from people who had brought them into town to sell them to butchers. And it becomes clear that the Tibetans have saved the most vital aspect of their culture even as they have lost almost everything else.
This brilliant white pagoda, built by Buddhist monks from Japan, sits on one of the most scenic spots in all of Pokhara. The rewards begin on the way. The trail to the pagoda goes through forests teeming with birds. When you emerge on the ridge of the hill, there is the unforgettable view of Phewa Tal and the mountains.
If waking up early to drive or hike up to a hilltop to watch the sunrise, or sweating it out on the trails to get a panoramic view of the city and mountains is not your thing, you can try paragliding. You can even opt for the unique form of paragliding called parahawking, where a raptor accompanies you and your pilot, guiding you to thermal currents.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/heading-pokhara-new-year-8-activities-shouldnt-missed.html,travel
Taudaha: A foggy view of wetland not so far from urban jungle,"Sunday, December 25, 2016","The mist made the light from the solar lamp posts on the other side of the pond blurry. Somewhere a fish leapt out of the water and fell back in. It was too dark and misty to see where the fish had jumped. Only the sound told me it was somewhere near.
As I watched, a pair of coots came out of the mist toward the water’s edge, as discreet as a flotilla approaching enemy shore. Their necks moved back and forth as they propelled themselves forward. An ever-widening ‘V’ followed in their wake. I could barely make out the white line that runs down their forehead to their beaks.
As I walked on along the edge, I noticed the silhouette of a tree. It was like an apparition, an optical illusion created by the mist. As I neared the tree, I heard my first bird sounds of the morning. But I couldn’t see them yet. An entire world existed behind the mist.
The pond was Taudaha. Darkness and mist made Taudaha seem wild and big, even though I knew its exact dimensions from earlier visits. When day finally broke, I could see that it had shrunk. Restaurants and “resorts” encircled the pond, encroaching on the lake’s shore, erecting thatch-roofed huts for lovebirds where once coots rummaged and egrets meditated on their prey. It seemed only a matter of time before homes, cafes and restaurants would squeeze Taudaha dry.



Mythology traces Taudaha’s origin back to when Manjushree, a Tibetan deity, sliced the hill at Chobar with his sword. The water of the lake that was Kathmandu Valley began draining out through this cleft. Seeing this, the nagas, serpents that lived in the lake, implored Manjushree to stop the destruction of their home. The deity created Taudaha as compensation to the displaced nagas. The serpents moved to the pond, where they are believed to live to this day.
It is fair to say that mythology and religion have saved Taudaha from ruin. Hindus revere snakes, so the abode of snakes is a sacred place. There are several naga shrines along the pond, which like any shrine are both venerated structures as well as reminders to uphold the place’s sanctity.
As a result, people did not treat Taudaha as a dumping site, a fate that befalls most water bodies in Kathmandu. So snakes, which are seen frequently here, still enjoy a more or less unspoiled habitat. Other beneficiaries include fish, which were released here by people as an act of benevolence. No one is more grateful for this water body than weary birds that arrive here to escape the harsh winters of Mongolia and Tibet. Some winter here, others rest and feed before continuing further south to the Terai.


Taudaha is like a small autonomous region surrounded by a rapacious superpower. Every time I visit, there are a couple of new restaurants. I wonder for how long the little pond will resist the tide of human greed. The precariousness of its existence and the uncertainty of its future make it even more appealing. So watching a little kingfisher skimming over the water warms your heart. An egret stretches its neck, poised to pounce on a fish, and you freeze so as not to disturb it. A pair of ducks floats by and you feel happy that they have a place to do so. There is profound solace in being in a place that attracts such beauty.
What a deity gave to serpents as compensation now offers consolation to people. Taudaha is as much a haven for snakes and birds as for anyone who doesn’t have a piece of the natural world around them anymore. As you watch the birds go about their routine of feeding and preening, you forget the road with its maddening traffic, the filth of the city, the loss of places like Taudaha. And the pond inspires hope. The fact that people have more or less left a place untouched in order to allow snakes, real and mythological, their space makes you hopeful that a bird exhausted from flying over the Himalayas will have a place to rest in for many years still.



Taudaha is 10 km from Sahid Gate. Turn south (left) at the Kalimati intersection (opposite the vegetable market) and continue towards Tribhuvan University. After crossing the Ring Road, keep going on the road along the Bagmati towards Chobar. Taudaha is approximately 2 km from Chobar.
There is another road that begins at the bridge in Nakkhu. Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge. There are several turns on this route so ask locals for directions. This road takes you to the new bridge at Chobar. Cross the bridge and turn left towards Taudaha.


Birdwatching
Taudaha is one of the last unpolluted wetlands in the Kathmandu Valley. It is therefore the last refuge of waterbirds, both local and migratory. This makes birdwatching here a thoroughly rewarding experience as the chance to spot some rare species is high. And you need not be a seasoned birder to do it. Birdwatching here is almost sedentary. You can sit on the stone wall along the shore and watch birds like Lesser Whistling Duck, Common Coot, Falcated Duck (rare), Mallard, Spot-billed Duck, Common Teal, Northern Pintail, Ruddy Shelduck, several species of pochards, Steppe Eagle and the Great Cormorant. The birds tend to congregate near the small island in the northeastern corner of the pond.
Hikes
The hills to the pond’s southwest offer some good hikes. You can either climb to the small white house on the hill directly west of Taudaha or go to the monastery south of that hill, which is a little higher. Both destinations have panoramic views of the mountains.
For more determined hikers there is the Champadevi shrine. Hiking there from Taudaha is much more taxing, so you will need more time. If you plan to do this hike, go in a group and start as early as possible.
Pharping
Taudaha is on the way to the medieval town of Pharping. There is a full day’s worth of sightseeing in Pharping. It ranges from ancient monasteries and temples to Nepal’s first hydropower station, built over a century ago. If you decide to go to Pharping, the Sheshnarayan Temple is highly recommended.

How a community-run homestay programme has placed Humla’s Burause on the map,"Friday, December 23, 2016","

In Burause of Humla, a district located at the mid-western part of Nepal, a community-run homestay programme is bringing in tourists to this often neglected village. Located at an hour’s hike away from Simikot, Humla’s district headquarters, Burause currerntly has nine homestay facilities in operation.
The region is mostly frequented by travellers to the Mansarovar region. After the Tato Pani entry point of the trek was closed due to the quakes of 2015, number of tourists visiting the region has increased manyfold.



The concept of homestay in Burause first came into highlight after a programme by Great Himalayan Trail was first conducted in the region six years ago. The number of homestays has steadily increased ever since.
Situated at an altitude of 2960m, Burause’s proximity to Simikot, which falls en route to Mansarovar, has proven to be advantageous for its villagers. On peak season this year, nearly 10,000 travellers passed through Simikot to reach Mansarovar. Moreover, the dearth of accommodation in Simikot has in turn boosted the homestays in Burause.



For those stopping by to stay at this village of 600, a choreographed display of the region’s culture will be on offer at the newly-built community hall of Burause. In the hall, built with assistance from UNESCO and other local bodies, dances like Syabru, Baakpa and Mahankal are organised.
“Even non-tourists like those working in Simikot have started visiting Burause in their leisure,” says Jung Lama, Chairman of Karnali Tourism Entrepreneurs’ Society.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/community-run-homestay-programme-placed-humlas-burause-map.html,travel
"Why Karnali is not just Rara, it’s Nepal’s intangible heritage","Wednesday, December 21, 2016","In September this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Karnali region. It was a dream come true, for I would also visit Rara Although at every turn I saw nature at it best–whether it was the serene lake of Rara or the terraced fields of Mugu, or the lush, fertile valley of Sinja–the trip, however, soon became much more than just about beautiful scenery .
But the trek (combined with bumpy bus rides) also brought before my senses, many other things: a unique, yet fast-disappearing lifestyle, songs passed down through the generations, gods that pre-date any historical record, festivals celebrated by entire communities, and myths that live in songs and folklore.
In short, I witnessed intangible heritages of Karnali that are difficult to even put into words. I bring back with me the pristine beauty of the roads less-walked, and the warmth of people that made those roads such a pleasure to travel on.

Kuri: On Bear-Controlled Trails,"Sunday, December 18, 2016","The silence and twisted trees gave the place an eerie look. Tufts of old man’s beard gave it a primeval look, like no one had been there in a long, long time.
Our guide motioned to us to stop. We could see no further than thirty feet because of the mist. He pointed to the dank forest floor, a cushiony carpet of leaves in varying stages of decay. There among the leaves was a pile of bear scat. Our guide told us it was dangerous to go further. We abandoned our plan of going to the hill’s peak and turned back.
On the way back to our lodge Sonam, our guide, showed us an opening on the floor in a corner of a meadow. It was a cave, he told us. Technically, it was a small pit. According to him, the “cave” was where an ascetic had meditated for years. Back then the village was only a herdsmen’s summer camp site. I peered in and saw that the cave was ten feet deep. Getting in, let alone spending time there, seemed impossible. But one thing was sure: there would be no disturbances down there.
Outside the cave, the whine of drill entering wood bored into the small village’s tranquility. The village was Kuri. It was known for the shrine of the Kalinchok Bhagwati that sat atop a nearby hill.

Kalinchok, as the small valley was also known, is well-known. Pilgrims came there to seek the goddess’s blessings. Weekenders came for the mountain panorama. A dirt road provided something of an off-road experience for motorcyclists; mountain bikers had a rugged trail to measure themselves against. People came for the quiet, people came for the snow.
The road had made Kuri accessible to those who could not walk up to it. So it was that the village needed more rooms. Hence the whine of the carpenter’s drill instead of the tinkling of bells around cows’ necks.

***

I had first seen Kuri when it was still a village in the classic sense. With no road coming into it, you had to trek.
There were seven or eight wooden houses, clustered together as if for warmth. They were the lodges. And they were right in the middle of the shallow valley, as if honoring some unspoken rule to keep a certain distance between the village and the hill with the shrine. In the evenings (and this, to me, was the most convincing effect) the place would be dark. The only light was the fire over which meals were cooked. When you went out to relieve yourself – and outside was the only option – you walked into another world. The sky was packed with stars and it seemed nearer to the earth, as if the weight of all those twinkling gems made it sag.

But that Kuri was long gone. On that morning when we had to abort the attempt to get to the horn-shaped hill southeast of Kuri, the drill was going mad. Sonam dai emptied the mushrooms we had collected onto a nanglo. We waited for his wife to cook lunch. There was electricity round the clock: a hydropower station in the district meant there would be no blackouts. There would also be, on that morning, no end to the drilling.
Kuri felt like (and it still does every time I visit) a place metamorphosing. A couple of new wooden houses – hotels – seemed to sprout everywhere in the valley. Motorbikes and jeeps and buses could now grunt up to the village. Bathrooms were indoors. There was cooking gas. Hotels were moving ever further up the trail toward the sacred hill. There was even a tea shop thirty-odd feet below the shrine. It was on its way to becoming a town, one new hotel room at a time.
Nature couldn’t actually protect this decline into prosperity, but it did impose certain restrictions. In the monsoon, the road closed for months. When it snowed, it was impossible for motorbikes to come up all the way to the village. They had to be left lower down the road, while the defeated owners walked into Kuri. Branches snapped under the weight of snow and took down the power lines with them: dark evenings returned to the village.
I liked that, the illusion of going back in time. I also liked the fact that in Kuri the movement of humans could be decided by bears, or their scat. Not all is lost in a place like that.



If you are the typical Nepali in terms of punctuality (or the untypical non-Nepali who has adopted this nation’s ways) your adventure will begin in the Old Bus Park in Kathmandu as you realize that there are buses in Nepal that do leave on time. That bus is the Super Express, which leaves every morning for Charikot. You can buy tickets at the counter on the northeastern corner of the station.
You will arrive in Charikot around mid-day. It is possible to trek to Kuri on the same day, but it’s a relentless climb (four to six hours). It’s best to stay the night in town and set out early the next morning. Don’t even think about doing the trek in a single day if you are going there in winter—unless you have experienced guides with you.
For those going up there on motorbikes and jeeps, ask the locals for directions to the dirt road to Kuri. Going up this road in the dry season will mean riding through dust clouds. Otherwise it’s an easy ride.


Hotel Tashi Delek is a family-run lodge that has all the amenities you can expect in a village. The husband knows Kuri and the surrounding area like the back of his hand. Accompanying him on his daily walks into the woods is a tour in local myth and history.

Kuri is a small village surrounded by a large wilderness. It takes minutes to get to a dense forest from your lodge and, if you are not careful, even less time to lose your way. While trekking up, follow the electric pylons that go all the way up to the valley. If on a walk around Kuri, don’t venture off into the woods alone.

Four reasons why Pathibhara should be on your Nepal travel bucket list,"Monday, December 12, 2016","While you may think that Pathibhara, a deity revered by Hindus, only appeals to the devout, you’d be surprised to know that the distinct setting of Eastern Nepal and the diversity of landscapes and culture, make it a must-see for everyone.
Located in Taplejung District, in the far-eastern region of the country, Pathibhara is one of those sites that can give you experiences vastly different from those provided by the regular tourist traps. Taking the road less-travelled can sometimes be more than fulfilling; after a trip to Pathibhara you’d understand.
.

The third highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga is the main highlight of the trip. After a short one-hour flight to Suketar, you are ready to enter the mountain’s territory. You could also take a bus to Phungling, Taplejung’s district headquarters, from where the temple is around 20 kilometers away.
At first sight, the eastern hills may seem similar any other hill in Nepal. Be patient, the region’s charm will slowly but surely grow on you.

A five hour ride on a four-wheeler will take you to the entry point of the temple. Then, a five-hour hike to the top starts. Along the trail, you will see the diversity of cultures that makes visiting the region, a distinct experience. Eastern Nepal is home to many ethnic communities.
Every once in a while, be sure to stop and soak in the surroundings. Mt. Kanchenjunga, Mt. Makalu and Mt. Kumbha Karna will smile at you.

When you reach the top, you will find the temple of the Goddess Pathibhara standing silently. It epitomises the collective faith and reverence of the devotees.
The sight makes for an interesting experience.

The deity is believed to have super powers. She looks after her devotees and protects them. The temple complex also makes for a perfect vantage point to take a sneak peek into the eastern Himalayas.
If you keep an open mind, the trek may become more than a journey.

Top five destinations you need to visit to beat winter in Nepal,"Sunday, December 11, 2016","When winter comes around, most of us plan to stay warm, by staying indoors. But there are places in Nepal whose charms increase as temperatures plummet. A coat of snow, a crust of frost; frozen waterfalls, and life slowed down so much that you lose track of time. Places that bristle with visitors are empty. The lodge owner who wouldn’t have time to exchange a few words with you in peak season spends entire evenings regaling you with stories. A whole new world opens up in the off-season. Here are popular places that are worth abandoning the warmth of your homes for in winter.

Often times it’s not the weather or the time of year that prevents you from hitting the trail; it’s a dearth of time. Most ideal trekking destinations require a week at the minimum, so you put off the trip until you will have a window of that duration. And more often than not the planned trek slips gets pushed further and further down the bucket list until it is forgotten.
Chisapani is a day’s trek from Kathmandu. That alone is reason enough to go there. The Chisapani trek is like a condensed version of longer treks like the Annapurna circuit. You begin your trek in the morning from Sundarijal, climb to the small village of Mulkharka, walk through a dappled forest, and arrive toward evening to watch a spectacular show of light on a Himalayan façade.
The cold is the only issue on this trek. Everything else – scenic villages, towering mountains, forests teeming with birds – is laid out along the trail like a buffet for the senses.
Poon Hill features big on guidebooks, makes it on every ‘Ten Best Treks in Nepal’ list and is blurted out in excitement by trekkers when asked to recommend a destination. It is famous to the point of being trite. But its fame snares you: you want to go, if only to prove that it’s not a big deal.
Trekking to Poon Hill is not as arduous as some of the other treks. You can get on a bus in Kathmandu, get off at Nayapul, walk to Birethanti, and begin you trek. Villages at regular intervals along the trail mean you can take your time. Lodge owners have been in the business a long time, so they know how to pamper guests.
What makes the Poon Hill trek unique is the ease with which rewards come your way. You can be sauntering through a village when you notice there is a huge mountain in front of you. You are walking through a dark forest, beginning to tire, pining for a cup of coffee when suddenly teahouses appear.

For trekkers who seek solitude, a physically demanding trail, a sense of being cut off and not knowing what to expect around the next corner, Poon Hill might be a disappointment. In many ways, the trek is tailor-made for those who seek convenience above travails, company over isolation.
The shortness of the trek is perhaps its biggest selling point. Reasonably fit people can do it four to five days. In two days, you go from a smoggy city to standing in the crisp mountain air, watching the morning light gild mountains.
Thak Khola is on many a romantic’s travel list. But what was once a real isolated corner of Nepal now has a road connecting it with several hill towns. When the pressures of the outside world reduce in winter, it is possible to experience vestiges of that romanticism that was once characteristic of this region of trans-Himalayan trade and ancient culture.
You can fly into Jomsom, the town made famous in the song Jomsome Bazar Ma, then walk either upriver toward Kagbeni and Muktinath or go downriver toward the idyllic Marpha and other Thakali towns. If you can brave driving inches from a precipitous fall, take a bus or a jeep from Beni. But if you want to soak in the culture and immensity of the region, there is no better way than to trek.
Though Thak Khola sees thousands of trekkers and pilgrims each year, there are still places here that are off the beaten path, abandoned or simply forgotten. Trekking here in winter means you will not have crowds congregating in sites like ruins of old forts, centuries-old monasteries, sacred lakes tucked in the folds of mountains and abandoned villages. Thak Khola in winter is paradise for loiterers and seekers of solitude.


Bardia is Nepal’s wild west. The national park is the largest protected area in the Terai. It is perhaps the last place remaining in Nepal where people’s lives are affected by wildlife on a daily basis. Local hotel operators are dependent on wild animal sightings for business, and the villagers struggle to save their crops from ravenous elephant and deer herds.

There is a charm in being on edge, and that is almost a guarantee in Bardia. Go on a jungle walk in the winter months and the fear and excitement of the wilderness is heightened by the foggy weather. A crash in the bush can be anything—an elephant, a tiger, a rhino.
Even if the crashing sound turns out to be a docile spotted deer, your senses are pricked. That sudden flow of adrenaline is what makes Bardia special. But there is every chance that you will encounter wild creatures here: Bardia has over 30 species of mammals, 230 species of birds, and several reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile and the gharial.
Bardia is not only about primeval forests and wild beasts. It is home to the Tharus, the indigenous inhabitants of the Terai. Theirs is an incredibly rich culture, something of a cross between Zen and living off the land. A glimpse into their adobe and wood huts reveals the secret to their ability to live in this hostile environment. They fashion everything they need from the jungle, but they take only as much as they need. A Tharu village is in fact a reflection of the wilderness, a small part of a larger whole.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/top-five-destinations-visit-beat-winter-nepal.html,travel
Photo story: Draining Nepal’s dangerous glacier lake,"Monday, December 5, 2016","The Nepal government announced it had finished draining the Imja glacier lake in Everest region on November 23.
Imja lake was in danger of flooding villages, bridges and trekking trails downstream. Imja lake is one of the six highly dangerous glacial lakes in Nepal.
It took more than six months for about 150 people including 40 military personnel and local Sherpas to construct an outlet and release almost four million cubic metres of water. The water level of lake–originally 149 metres deep – fell by 3.4 metres.







Nepal has thousands of glacier lakes. Many of these are filling up fast because of warming temperatures and melting glaciers.
Glacier lakes have burst their banks 24 times in Nepal since the 1960s, three of which were in the Dhud Koshi river basin in the Everest region.
The Nepal government set up flood risk reduction project, supported by the Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Programme. Early warning systems have been installed in six settlements on the Everest trekking trails to send flood warnings to people downstream.
Tourists have suggested the government shift trails on Everest to higher places so trekkers and porters climbing the mountain are safe from potential glacier lake floods.■

Lost in Phulchowki: Night out on a rock,"Sunday, November 27, 2016","As my friends and I stepped from the trail onto a graveled road, a pair of kalij pheasants fluttered away into the forest. We were taking the trails instead of the circuitous dirt road that wound down from the Phulchowki peak to the Godavari village.
Of course, it hadn’t occurred to us then that we had lost our way. In a hurry to get down the hill, we had taken a wrong turn. After two such turns into the forest, we were completely lost.
Maybe because we were so near to Kathmandu, in the Phulchowki forest, less than an hour away from Godavari, we were confident of easily finding our way. So instead of retracing our steps to the main road, we had decided to go down through the forest, believing that the road was directly below us.
There were six of us, all entertaining thoughts of getting home. Two – Mohit and Sushil – were my friends with whom I had hiked to the Phulchowki peak earlier that day; the other three – Santosh, Raj Kumar, and Amrit – we had met on our way down. The trio had emerged ahead of us out of nowhere. We took this as a sign of their thorough knowledge of the area.
After sliding uncontrollably for over fifty meters, we came to a halt near a ravine. I proposed following the stream flowing through the ravine, on the principle that it flowed down to Godavari.
With the fading light, the greenery in the ravine turned grey, and it was steadily getting darker. We had been walking along the stream for a few minutes when we came to a waterfall. On either side of the stream were steep but climbable slopes.
“We can go down from there,” suggested Santosh, pointing to a rocky wall near the thirty-foot waterfall.
“Are you crazy? That wall is too steep,” replied Amrit. Sushil, Mohit, and I sided with Amrit.
“What would you rather do? We can’t stay here,” said Raj Kumar, who was supporting Santosh’s idea.
“We can climb up and move along that hill,” I suggested, pointing to the ravine’s north face.
“Do what you want. We’re going down from here,” declared Santosh, walking toward the rocky wall, with Raj Kumar following.
The rest of us turned around and went uphill.
***
It was already pitch dark. Labouring uphill in complete darkness I pictured the two daredevils coasting downstream. I began ruing my decision and envying theirs.
“They’ve surely found the trail,” said Amrit, regret discernible in his voice. “They’re probably down in Godavari by now.”
“Is this the way we go down from?” Mohit, who was a few feet behind me, asked. By now, I was leading the group.
“No, no! Go back, go back!” I shouted, clutching saplings for support.
I had been using my legs to feel my way forward and just when Mohit asked me for directions, my extended feet didn’t touch down on anything.
Then, suddenly, we heard shouts.
“It’s Santosh and Raj Kumar! They’ve found the trail!” cried Amrit.
We descended in the direction of the voices and found our intrepid friends waiting beside the stream. They hadn’t found the trail but we were relieved to have found them.
***
In a file, we began following the stream again. The forest echoed with chants of “Wait up! Wait up!”
Cursing in accompaniment to the slips and splashes, we arrived at a place where the stream had cut through a huge boulder, creating a low tunnel. We passed under it, one at a time.
Some fifty meters on, where the stream fell about forty feet, I finally gave up hope of a meal and a soft bed. But the two fellows that had climbed down the first waterfall didn’t.
“Let’s cut some vines to climb down on,” proposed Santosh.


I quickly laid out the hazards of such a plan.
“It’s too dark to do anything. Besides this fall is way higher than the last one,” I countered.
When logic failed I reached out for sentiment.
“What will we say to your families if something happens to you?”
Rationalism dawned on them with the mention of family. They gave up their outrageous plan. We decided to go back upstream to the boulder and spend the night on it.
***
Sushil sat down on a small rock and flipped open his cell phone. I asked him what he was trying to do. “I am calling home,” he said casually. I would have laughed, but the only thing I managed was a cynical snicker.
We were in the bowels of a deep ravine, surrounded by a canopy of trees that had not an inch of opening in it, and Sushil thought the call would go through!
But just then a miracle happened. “Hello, Mother. I am going to stay at a friend’s place tonight,” Sushil said.
I grabbed the phone from him and called my uncle. I told him a Jesuit priest who had taught us in college had invited us to stay the night at the school in Godavari.
Soon, an outpouring of lamentations began. After gathering firewood, we had climbed onto the boulder, and kindled a fire. But because the wood was damp, the fire only smoldered, barely producing heat.
Mohit regretted his recklessness. “The biggest mistake we made today,” he began, “was finishing the whiskey in one go.” Sushil was losing body heat and interest in hikes rapidly. “I am never going on a hike ever again,” he announced, shivering uncontrollably.
***
After midnight the fire finally began burning in earnest, and the extra warmth made it possible to sleep for a few minutes at a time. But every time I woke up after a nap, someone would express a chilling forecast for the morning. The theory was that the temperature would plunge with the arrival of dawn.
It was a discomforting prospect, but so was leaving our seats, which had taken hours to warm. I finally left the rock with a companion and returned with enough wood to keep the fire going till dawn.
At first light, we began to climb the hill slope right from where it met the boulder. Just before we left the rock, Santosh took out a condom from his pocket, inflated it, and tying a knot cast it into the stream. I saw that he was a man who threw caution to the wind and pre-caution into the stream.
Or maybe it was his way of paying tribute to Nature for sheltering us for a night. Maybe a night in the primeval surroundings had inspired him to go celibate. I will never know.
The path we took was so narrow and precarious in some places that we had to proceed on all fours. But our bestial maneuverings paid off. Half an hour later we found the trail we had lost the day before.
Ecstatic, we ran until we reached the temple where the forest trail to Phulchowki diverged from the paved road downhill to Godavari.
As we washed ourselves in the cold water from the temple’s stone conduits, the cuts and scratches on our arms and faces came alive as mild stings. Blood had congealed in these lacerations, adding color to Nature’s needlework.
The cuts have healed and turned into tiny scars. Every time I see them, the thrill and chill of our small wilderness experience is rekindled. I’m reminded of the magical quality of friendship that turns the miserable into the memorable.■

Poon Hill: A sneak peek into the Annapurnas,"Tuesday, November 22, 2016","The monsoon clouds settled down and a few patches of rain scattered the distant mountains. As dust was washed away, beautiful weather soon set in.
It all began when Dashain approached the city, and the torrential rains faded away. I had to head into the woods and up the mountains. I carefully designed my trip to include the famous Poon Hill to see the mountains from a distance, before heading straight into the heart of the Annapurnas.


Along the trail, I was greeted with patches of clouds rushing into the forest. The woods looked as if they came out straight from a fairy tale. The frequently changing weather must have done the trick, I thought. Mist, meanwhile, added more mysticism to it.
There were cascading waterfalls, dense forests and greenery as far as the eyes could see. My lungs, on the other hand, were, for the first time in many months, full of fresh air.
The darkness of the night enveloped the day as I reached Ghorepani, a hamlet located  2,874 metres above sea level. The drizzle that started towards the evening lasted the whole night, making hikers anxious about the morning weather.


The showe was on till four in the morning as trekkers prepared to begin the pre-dawn hike to Poon Hill. Every day, hundreds of wanderers from around the globe hike up in the darkness and patiently wait in the shivering cold for the sun to rise.
This particular morning, we were not disappointed. The veil of cloud was lifted to reveal the full view of the Annapurnas, Machhapuchhre, Nilgiri, Hiuchuli and other peaks before sunrise. The postcard-perfect beauty was right in front of eyes, at arm’s length.
Mesmerised we were, to behold the towering canvass painted with pink, golden, orange and bluish hues.
Poon Hill, lived up to its hype. The glow of the morning had turned the earth into a beautiful work of art.



While Poon Hill might be the destination for some, there are other adventurous souls, with few more days to spend in the wilderness. They venture deeper into the mountains after having a sneak peek over the horizon.
Like those of the latter breed, capturing a few moments of beauty in the timeless memories, I began ny steps down the hill, happiness painted all over my face; I was an inch closer to the heart of mightiest of the mountains.

Shivapuri National Park and Nagi Gompa: Strangers on a Monastery Lawn,"Sunday, November 20, 2016","
Setting out in the pre-dawn grayness, driving through a sleepy Kathmandu, my cousin and I were already filled with a sense of expectation. The roads that I was used to seeing choked with vehicles, horns blaring, was empty, its surface the same color as that of the sky.
My cousin, a photographer with a keen interest in wildlife, had wanted me to show him places around Kathmandu where he could photograph something wild. Shivapuri National Park had come to mind immediately—for reasons other than its faunal diversity and scenic beauty. Although I, too, wanted to see wild animals, a trip to Shivapuri would, if not anything else, be an escape from the city.
We parked at the entrance to the national park at Pani Muhan, and waited for it to get light. (Entering national parks before daybreak or after nightfall is prohibited.) Although there is a graveled road inside the park, we decided to leave our car at the entrance and walk from there. We reasoned that would increase our chances of spotting wild animals. After filling in our names and addresses in the visitors’ record book and paying the entry fee, we began walking, going past wooden boards with military aphorisms painted on them. We passed an abandoned army building, rounded a curve, and were in the wilderness.

Feet scuttled in the brittle forest floor as we plodded up the road. There had been a bout of strong wind and rain the previous night. The signs of the storm were everywhere. Leaves covered the ground. Cutting a course through this leaf-littered floor were tiny gullies—remnants of the rivulets that had flowed the night before. The entire forest smelled and looked so fresh it seemed to have been created only a couple of hours ago.
We rounded a turn on the gravel road and came to a spot where there was a large gap in the screen of trees. Framed within this gap was Kathmandu, its notable landmarks – Singha Durbar, Swoyambhunath – faintly visible through the veil of smog that is almost a permanent feature of the Valley now. A little ahead the storm had knocked down a tree, blocking the road. We ducked under the branches and were able to pass. Emerging out of the canopy of trees, I saw a faint line of color amidst the dark tree tops on the hill in the distance. It was the prayer flags of the Nagi Gompa, our destination.

When we arrived at the prayer hall of the monastery, a few people were busy sweeping the leaves strewn on the lawn. Some were collecting the leaves with their bare hands and throwing it into a doko, or wicker basket. When the basket was full, someone would carry it to the compost pit. In this group of cleaners was a blonde girl in a white dress and a man dressed exactly like Jesus in popular paintings. The only difference was that he had dreadlocks.
Both these almost anachronistic figures were busy sweeping, collecting, and dumping the leaves. They were helped by a couple of other people, who looked like they were the regular staff at the monastery.
***
Drums thudded and cymbals clanged. The chanting of Tibetan mantras, coming from nuns, was soft and sweet in contrast to the guttural and somber tone of recitals by monks.
The cleaning continued, as though it were a ritual.
I set my backpack on a bench and began collecting leaves and putting them in the doko. The guy with the dreadlocks gave me a smile and a nod of acknowledgment as we passed each other on our way to the dumping site. The blonde girl brought handfuls of leaves to put into my basket.
I moved from one section of the lawn to another. In one corner, under a corrugated iron roof, a few old nuns sat making butter lamps, gently nodding in greeting and flashing toothless smiles.
After some time, a maroon wave of nuns flowed out of the prayer hall. The dozens of pairs of flip-flops disappeared from the temple’s doorsteps. The nuns were mostly teenagers, some of them children of ten or less. A few were coy and silent. Others were mischievous and playful: the energy they had contained and channeled on the scriptures during prayers was now pouring out in nudges, bantering, and laughter. They joked with my cousin as he walked by, struck poses for him when he trained his camera on them, trying hard to put on calm expressions but bursting out in giggles within seconds. They pursed their lips and suppressed their mirth instantaneously when an old nun trudged by, turning over her prayer beads.

It was a lovely day and an equally beautiful setting. I drank the sweet water that flows unceasingly from the several taps at the monastery. Rice bowls laid out in rows to dry in the sun reminded me that I was in a monastic community, where people helped each other in their spiritual aspirations. I felt a sense of irony when I thought how lay men and women had worked together to clean a garden, demonstrating, if only for the moment, the beauty of society, and doing it in a place removed, at least physically, from society.
I set aside an hour or more each day to be alone, and to be alone in a place that allows me to do something (mostly by not doing much) with that priceless solitude. I go away from Kathmandu once in a while, for a day or two, sometimes for longer. The logic is that such excursions will allow me to clear my mind and reinvigorate myself. It is basically turning my back on Kathmandu.
Walking back toward our car that morning, through a green tunnel of arching trees that were abuzz with bird song, I reflected on the morning I had just had. There were no photos of wild animals in our cameras. Even the ubiquitous eagles that wheel and dip near the monastery had been surprisingly absent. My mind kept going back to the team of strangers, some whose job it was to keep the monastery premises clean, others who had helped them because they happened to be there. I felt a sense of satisfaction. It was partly because of the rejuvenating place I had been in and partly because of the experience of the day. But it was mostly due to the realisation that I was returning not to a changed city but with a change in my way of looking at it. ■",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/shivapuri-national-park-nagoi-gompa-strangers-monastery-lawn.html,travel
Finding wildernesses around Kathmandu’s concrete jungle,"Sunday, November 13, 2016","The term concrete jungle has been used so often to refer to Kathmandu that I think it has created a wall in the minds of valley’s denizens. Very few people seem to mention – or even remember – the wonderful outdoors that are the hills that encircle the city.
Kathmandu is blessed with wonderfully preserved forested areas that are rich in wildlife. Here are a few that would make for a memorable weekend hike.

Perhaps because Shivapuri is always in sight, it somehow escapes the imagination of the locals.
Shivapuri is no Chitwan, or Bardia. You don’t go in expecting to see tigers, elephants or rhino. On a lucky day, you may see a ratuwa, barking deer. But the woods are food for the jaded senses. You feel the change, the freshness, the revival of something inside as soon as you enter through the gates at Pani Muhan. The shadowy road has a soundtrack of birdsong pouring in from the canopy. A hundred meters or so from the gates, there is that most coveted of things: silence. Whenever that silence is broken, it is by something natural: a brook’s murmur, the scuttling of birds on the forest floor, the sudden crash of a startled animal.
There is one frown-inducing spot on the trail though. Around a bend, the forest cover suddenly disappears and there is a clear view of the city below. You are likely to shake your head and mutter “concrete jungle” before moving on.

But the ugliness of the cityscape is forgotten quickly as you walk on in the shady road. For those who are not into long hikes, Nagi Gompa is the place to turn back from.Walking uphill for another couple of hours brings you to Shivapuri’s peak ((2732m). On the way you pass Baghdwar, the place where the Bagmati originates. The peak itself is not something remarkable, but the views of mountains from there are unrivaled from any point on the Kathmandu Valley’s rim.
The Nagarjun hill has one of the best-preserved wildernesses around Kathmandu. It could be a retreat for anyone tired of walking down paved roads under the gaze of high-rises. Dense forests, a steady but easy climb and a monastery at the summit make this an ideal destination for a weekend hike. There are two routes to Jamacho, the name for the summit: one begins north of Swayambhunath and the other is a ten-minute drive north from Balaju Baisdhara Park.
The Phulchowki hill, like Shivapuri, was once a forest set aside for the Rana elites to hunt in. Today, the mountain is the perfect place for Kathmanduites to feed their greenery-starved senses.
Phulchowki is one of the best places for birdwatching in Kathmandu. Species that have all but vanished from other parts of the valley still survive in good numbers here. It is a wilderness with a road, making it a destination for all kinds of visitors from binoculars-toting birders to hikers to motorcyclists.
Read also: Here’s how you can escape Kathmandu, without leaving it!
The trail is also fantastic for mountain biking. Anyone going to Phoolchowki on wheels needs to be careful though, because the road acquires a layer of ice in winter.
If the hike up to the summit is too much for you, you can still get a feel of the outdoors and rich birdlife of the area by visiting the Godavari Botanical Gardens. Calling this garden a little paradise, when you consider how deprived the city is of greenery, is not an exaggeration. Its appeal is simple: being in a place where every inch is taken up by plants.
The hike to the Champa Devi’s shrine is a mini pilgrimage of sorts. You begin at Chalnakhel, on the road to Pharping, and climb steadily until you get to a ridge. From there it’s another climb up to the forested summit. The reward for climbing all the way up there is a scene resembling the paintings on display in curio shops in Kathmandu: small villages, a river, a pond, verdant hills and rising above them, a jagged fence of snowy peaks.
Looking down you notice that there is still plenty of farmland here—the kind of place Kathmandu was in the past. And perhaps there is a moment when you realise that the hike has brought out a side of you that you lost in the concrete jungle. Chances are, you will find it in the real jungles that surround Kathmandu.


The Shivapuri and Nagarjun hills are both part of the Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Park. Entry into and movement within them is limited to daylight hours. Rules apart, it is advisable, especially if you are going in winter, to know the area well. Miscalculations can often mean that you will end up hiking in the dark—a hazard in the hilly terrain and dense forests. Always carry a good flashlight with you and plenty of water when going on a hike in these forests.
There have been several cases of people being mugged in Phoolchowki, so go in big groups if possible. The forest is also in the news for people losing their way and search parties having to go out to find them. Keep to the graveled road to avoid that sort of misadventure.
After the initial scattered houses, there are no houses on the trail to Champa Devi’s shrine. Carry plenty of drinking water and food with you. It’s best to begin the hike there early in the morning to give yourself enough time to complete the taxing climb, rest and return down to the road.

The halcyon hues of Pokhara’s World Peace Pagoda,"Monday, November 7, 2016","The white-washed structure of the Shanti Stupa stands proud at the southwest end of the Pokhara valley, at only 7 km away from the city centre. This Buddhist pagoda-style stupa is positioned at a height of 1,100m; but the hike to the stupa is not a regular one.
As the valley slowly welcomed winter last month, photographer Ronil Pratap Thapa spent a week in the lake city, capturing the stupa in many different hues.
Among the many photographs of the stupa, Thapa shot some breathtaking panoramas of the Machhapuchhre range, the buzzing Pokhara valley below and the calm Fewa lake, which succinctly unifies the town’s charm.
“These trinity, as I like to call them, look even more exquisite when highlighted by the golden sunrise.”

To Marpha: Nepal’s postcard vintage village,"Sunday, November 6, 2016","It is hard to imagine a more appealing village in Nepal than Marpha. It has clean streets, quaint houses and cheery locals. Open a window of your hotel and you see apple trees. Tourists saunter down the narrow street, awestruck by the preserved cultural gem. It is a place that makes a case for not giving in to crass development.
Sitting in a corner of an arid landscape, it has the look of an oasis. And it is a haven of sorts. The road that was built a couple of years ago has transmogrified architecture in Thak Khola. Old style houses – rammed earth roofs, stone walls – have all but disappeared in many villages. Concrete came with the road, and now it is the material of convenience. But Marpha never put out the carpet for the road. Instead, it put the road several hundred meters away from it, with a buffer of apple orchards. As a result, Marpha is like it was years ago—at least architecturally.
Marphalis have always had a knack for keeping out threats. The original site of the village, a small plateau an hour’s hike west from the current location, is testimony to that strategic thinking. There is only one access route, a narrow trail, to the plateau. On three sides there are precipitous falls. It was a carefully selected site, an anthropologist told me. Bandits from Tibet often raided the villages in the past, so the topography helped to thwart attacks.


The ancestors of modern day Marphalis moved down to new Marpha later, possibly to be nearer to the waters of the Kali Gandaki. Now for a couple of months a year, they find themselves on the path of a torrent of trekkers. Many villages have undergone a character change in the face of tourism. Not Marpha: it is known to anyone who has done the Annapurna trek as a shining example of how to ride the tourism wave without compromising one’s identity. There is Wi-Fi, apple pie and hot baths in the village, but there are also stacks of firewood on the roofs that were stowed by the lodge operator’s parents. When there is a wedding in the village, business is closed for a day to attend the ceremony. (I was made acting lodge operator for a couple of hours when the owners went to a relative’s wedding.)

In a way, Marpha can feel a little staged. After spending time in Thak Khola’s villages, whose chief characteristic is to provide for tourists – rooms, food, drinks – Marpha can seem too good to be true. On most mornings, the village elders sit near the village’s northern gate, basking in the morning sun, chatting. It looks like a cultural show put on for the visitor. But that is Marpha; its main charm is that it is itself at all times.
And then there is the sensation of having arrived in a place where hurrying is prohibited. Its narrow street (it has only one) is peopled at most times by middle-aged Tibetan women who sit chatting with each other until a newcomer passes by. Then they try to sell trinkets but the efforts are never aggressive. It’s like the selling was an excuse for striking conversations and exchanging smiles.

Step away from the main street toward the mountain face to the east and it’s even quieter. The village monastery is located there. It’s not an impressive building: it doesn’t have the size or antiquity of other more famous monasteries in the region. But it offers nice views. From under prayer flags fluttering in the stiff Thak Khola wind, you can see the verdant fields and a flimsy plume of water wafting down the mountain face across the river.
There is one curious object just beyond the northern end of Marpha. It’s a huge megaphone-like object sitting atop a tall pole, as though there were frequent broadcasts here. But it’s rusty and looks like no sound has come out of it for a long time. It is just as well that that gigantic sound system is silent. The actions of the Marphalis are louder than any words. They have proved that you could be in the center of one of the world’s most popular trekking routes and yet not lose your social and cultural identity.■

The quickest way to get to Marpha is to take any of the several morning flights from Pokhara to Jomsom. From Jomsom you can either walk for thirty minutes, take a taxi or hire a horse to get to Marpha.
The other option is to take a bus or a 4WD jeep that plies the road between Beni and Marpha. It takes nine hours to get from Beni to Marpha. Nothing, however, compares to trekking to Marpha. The trek begins in Beni. It takes between four to six days to trek to Marpha.


Village Shrine
On a mountain face directly west of the village is a slab of whitewashed rock. What looks like a careless spillage is in fact an ancient shrine. The site is a short climb from Marpha’s northern gate.
Ekai Kawaguchi Museum
In 1899, a Japanese Zen monk called Ekai Kawaguchi arrived in Marpha. He stayed for two years, preparing all the while to sneak into Tibet, which he eventually did. His story is told in Scott Berry’s book A Stranger in Tibet. The house Kawaguchi lived in has been made into a museum that showcases some of his possessions.
Old Marpha
What was once a strategically located village virtually immune to raids by bandits is now an idyllic swathe of apple and apricot trees. Besides the isolation, mountain views and picturesque scenery, a visit to Old Marpha offers an insight into the region’s history.
Dumba Lake
Sacred and serene, Dumba is a small lake nestled between hills. The barrenness of the landscape accentuates its turquoise blue waters, making it a place to visit for anyone looking for a memorable photo. The lake is sacred to the local communities, so swimming or littering are strictly prohibited. The lake is a two-hour walk from Marpha.
Chairo Gumba
Walking a little more than a kilometer from the southern end of Marpha and crossing the Kali Gandaki River will bring you a copse of tall pine trees. The trees conceal Chairo Gumba, one of the oldest monasteries in Thak Khola. It was built nearly four centuries ago. Its age is evident in the sculptures in the altar room. The room also has some ancient-looking rolls of old scriptures and its walls are covered in frescoes painted decades ago.


Lodging in Marpha is pretty much the same. Hotel Mount Villa (9817114170) offers clean and comfortable rooms. More than that, its owner’s tales about the Khampa warriors is reason enough to stay there. Book rooms in advance if you are traveling in peak trekking season (March-May and October-December).

"In Nepal’s ancient salt hub Dana, a walk past yesterday","Sunday, October 30, 2016","“Let’s go up here,” my companion suggested, crossing the road and climbing up a small trail.
“I want to show you something.”
My companion had, it turned out, taken me on a trail that went as much up as back into the past.
We were soon on a narrow stone-paved street. Huge Newar-style houses, bigger than any I’d seen in Kathmandu, stood on either side of the path. We had arrived in a town several decades after it had blossomed, boomed, and then declined.
The town was Dana in Myagdi district of west Nepal. It lay on the ancient salt/rice trade route that passed through the Kali Gandaki valley. The trade route once connected Nepal’s mid-hills to Thak Khola. From there it went further north to Lo Manthang and eventually into Tibet. More recently, it had become a spot on the Annapurna trek map.
Dana was a town redolent of the prosperity Thak Khola once enjoyed. Everything reflected opulence: palatial houses with large courtyards, lavish use of wood, ornately carved windows, slate roofs and orange orchards.
But time and the fluctuating fortunes had done their work too. The courtyards were now overgrown with grass, the suntala trees looked old and untended, the colors of the walls had faded, doors were missing and windows were broken in places. It was as if people and prosperity had abandoned it overnight.
A few people still lived in Dana, although passing through I only noticed women. Some of them were washing clothes in the courtyards. Others, older women, were basking in the sun. Their presence only made the place look more forlorn: the houses looked bigger with only a few people in their courtyards.
It was hard not to wonder, and easy to visualise, what Dana would have been like in its heydays. The towns of Thak Khola, especially those that acted as trading posts, at their height were impressive sights. Giuseppe Tucci, the eminent Tibetologist who traveled in Thak Khola, Dolpo and Jumla in the 1950s, called the houses of the local merchants “palaces.”
In 1962, traveling around Thak Khola, the ethnologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf was similarly awestruck by the beauty of the houses of the Thakali merchants.
He described them in his 1975 book Himalayan Traders, writing that they were “of a size, architectural standard and quality of interior decoration most uncommon in the hills of Nepal and surpassed only by the houses of some of the rich Sherpa traders of Solu.”


Dana was now a fossil of a town, with only an imprint of its glory days remaining. Bottles of pickles were arrayed on window sills. From one window several yak skins were hanging. Millet stalks were drying in a courtyard, the same courtyard, perhaps, where grain and salt were once piled, exchanged, and loaded onto pack animals.
Recalling that salt used to be bartered for grain here, Dana, the Nepali word for grain, struck me as an appropriate name. However, the town’s name is not thusly derived. Tukche, another big center for bartering, reflects its mercantile function more obviously. ‘Tuk’ means ‘grain’ and ‘che’ means ‘flat place’ in Tibetan.
***
In its heydays, the courtyards in Dana would have been filled with mounds of grain and salt, Tibetans and Nepali traders haggling over exchange rates, bags of rice from Nepal’s grain basket in the south loaded on pack animals to be carried north, and rock salt from western Tibet being loaded on the backs of porters returning south.
And presiding over this scene of ancient transaction would have been a beaming subba (salt commissioner), calculating his imminent profits. To see all this, we would have needed to arrive in Dana, at the latest, in 1927, the year the salt-trade monopoly (nun theka) was officially abolished.
From then on, the salt trade reverted to the days of free trade, with several traders involved in the bartering of Tibetan salt. Although trade continued freely until the takeover of Tibet by China, individual traders could not deal in quantities as large as the subbas had done.


Dana’s history as a center of power and wealth was a long one. According to some documents, the customs office was established in Dana in the 1850s. Some scholars think it could have been in operation since the eighteenth century. One document mentions the collection of customs duties at Dana by a contractor, known as ijaridar, in 1853. Records show that the ijaridar (the system was known as ijari) was paying an annual royalty of Rs 29,001 to the government. Dana was probably selected as the location for the customs office owing to it warmer winters compared to the harsh cold months of Tukche.
The anthropologist Michael Vinding traces the history of Dana’s customs office to the days when Thak Khola was under the sway of the kingdom of Parbat. “In order to collect customs duties from the traders along the Kali Gandaki River, the kings of Parbat are said to have established a customs office (Bhansar) at Dana, an hour’s walk south of Thak Khola. In 1786 Parbat fell to the Shah kings of Gorkha, and the collection of customs duties at Dana thus came under the administration of the newly founded Nepali State.” One historical document from the 11th century refers to the king of Parbat as the “Grain King.” This title reflects the annual tribute paid to the Parbat kings, who controlled parts of Thak Khola.
In 1862, Prime Minister Jang Bahadur Rana (1846-79) changed the old revenue system, introducing a system of monopoly over the salt trade in Thak Khola. Under the system, the collection of customs duty and the salt-trade monopoly were granted by the government to the highest bidder. The winner of such an auction, held every three years, was given the title of subba.
The palatial houses of Dana belonged to the subbas who had the wealth, and thus the pomposity, to build big. They were influenced by the rich Newar merchants they encountered in trading hubs such as Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal and Bhairawa. As my trekking companion, an anthropologist well-versed in the history of Thak Khola, explained, “The Thakali subbas wanted to look like, act like, and be recognised and seen as part of the Nepal ruling class and entrepreneurial elite.”
‘Hollow’ was the word that came to mind walking down the main street of Dana eighty-five years after the salt monopoly was abolished. The exteriors of the houses were in a reasonably good condition, giving them the appearance of having lost only their souls and vitality. They stood lifeless and silent, yet were imposing, like the skeleton of a huge animal.


A trade route once made Dana what it was.
Their modern-day avatars, the road that now goes up Thak Khola, has contrived to keep Dana a ghost town. In a cruel twist of fate, Dana is now at the receiving end of the accidental monopoly in tourism that certain towns and villages in Thak Khola enjoy. It does not make sense to a trekker or someone traveling in a vehicle to stop at Dana; it is simply a place to pass through, not to stay.
If Dana had become a regular stop on trek itineraries, there is little doubt some of the magnificent houses would have been renovated and turned into lodges and hotels.
But who knows? One of these days, some descendant of the last subba might decide to turn one into a hotel and, just for nostalgia’s sake, organise a daily reenactment of the golden days by having a mule train (loaded with Snickers?) trundle down Dana’s street. ■

Sighs and apple pies in western Nepal’s Jomsom,"Sunday, October 23, 2016","I was hoping the flight from Pokhara to Jomsom would be a flight into a time warped zone. Instead, I found a place that seemingly took its cues for growth from Thamel, Kathmandu. But that was after I had gotten over the view from Jomsom’s airport. I don’t fly thousands of kilometers a year but I am willing to bet that there is not another airport in the world that can better the sight of Mt. Nilgiri (North) rising, it seems, from the tarmac. The airport is also the only one I have been in so far where you want to linger after you have got off the plane.
The arrival was perfect but soon after, the romanticism nosedived. Jomsom was a collection of lodges and restaurants on either side of a dirt road on which motorbikes sputtered and jeeps rumbled by. There was apple pie galore, but no yaks. To my horror, an ATM snuggled between two stores. No mule trains, no rugged traders or herders. The only thing faintly old-fashioned was Indian pilgrims dressed in sweaters and monkey caps. It was clear I was a decade or so too late for the old Jomsom.


But the legendary winds arrived on time. Soon the Kali Gandaki had a stream of dust flowing right above it. At that hour, Jomsom was the classic frontier town: wind, dust, emptiness. Lingering over coffee and pies and reading books in the sunlight seemed the thing to do here. I would have waddled in despair at having arrived in the once-forbidden region after café lattes and croissants, but fortunately I was in the company of an old timer. He told me that the interesting stuff was across the river.
Across the river was Thini, a village where houses still had stacks of firewood lining the edges of their rammed-earth terraces. But when we arrived it was deserted: alleys were empty, doors slammed shut. A man told us that there was a big ceremony at the village monastery. Minutes later we were stuffing ourselves with fried rice and chicken curry. We could see Jomsom from the monastery. It was a dreary sight, a place whose sole appeal was a runway. The walk back was lovely. Wheat plants swayed in the wind, a green sea made more appealing by the expanse of dun mountains all around.


Jomsom’s best moment is twilight. As darkness gathers, the town’s crass buildings turn inconspicuous. Only the tallest peaks retain their color, going from white to golden to inky within seconds. Romanticism (or its ghost) slinks out again as you forget that you are in a place that has several daily flights. You are among the mountains, and that is enough to make you think you are in a different world, one that is not completely in the talons of technology yet.
Like any other place that has cemented its name on a tourist’s wish list, Jomsom has cast off its indigenous character. It needed to: comfort and convenience are cornerstones of tourism. And because it has, we get to withdraw money from a machine if we run out of cash while there. It’s a big loss for any romantic to arrive in a place you read about as worlds away only to find it’s a replica of a corner of your city. But at least there is a cup of latte and a slice of apple pie to munch on as you lament the change and console yourself with a view of a mountain’s tip turning into gold.■

There are three to four flights every day from Pokhara to Jomsom. A dirt road goes all the way up to Jomsom. You can get buses or 4WD jeeps from Beni. It takes close to nine hours on this road to get to Jomsom. Trekking is still the best way to get to Jomsom. The trek from Beni to Jomsom takes between four to five days.


Mustang Eco Museum
Located at the western end of town, this museum has a wonderful collection of artifacts. The display includes cultural objects as well as specimens of Mustang’s natural resources, including a section on herbal medicines. The museum also has a Buddhist chapel replica.
Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) office
If you are into the region’s flora and fauna, then the ACAP office is the place to be. Its collection of photos of wild animals and birds is also reason enough for a visit.
Thini Gompa
Besides the quaintness of its architecture, Thini village also has a cultural and spiritual gem—the Thini Gompa, which was originally a Bon monastery.

Dumba Lake
Located a leisurely two-hour walk from Thini is Dumba Lake. This body of water is revered by the locals and thus swimming is prohibited in it. Even the most secular person is bound to be captivated by the lake’s stunning colors.
Along the Kali Gandaki
Walk along the Kali Gandaki to get a closer feel of the region’s geography. The river bank is flatter and wider at the northern end of town, making walking pleasanter. Continue upriver (north) from there for some spectacular rock formations. While on the river bed look for saligram, ammonite fossils revered by Hindus for its association with the god Vishnu.
The Apple Capital
Jomsom’s attractions are limited and the banality of the architecture and the aridity of the surroundings create a yearning for a place with a more traditional feel. The answer is down the road (south) in Marpha. It’s narrow paved street and white houses have been preserved beautifully. The road is several hundred meters away from the village, screened by apple orchards.

Hotel Tilicho has clean rooms and a lovely, spacious dining area with great views of Nilgiri. Om’s Home is an expensive place, but it has the history, among other things, to justify the price. Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Danny Denzongpa stayed here when they were in town to shoot Khuda Gawah.

Step into any of Jomsom’s many restaurants, and you will be served wonderful Nepali, Indian, Continental and Chinese dishes. For dessert, there is a bakery at the northern end of town.

Altitude, dryness and cold are relentless in their attacks on your skin in Jomsom, making sunscreen and hats indispensible. Don’t forget to take sunglasses for protection against the daily dust storms.

There is an entry fee for the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP). You can pay the fee in Jomsom, but it’s always better to get it done in Kathmandu or Pokhara. Foreigners also need to pay for the Trekking Information Management System (TIMS), which is available at the Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN) office in Kathmandu.

Nepal-Tibet border village sees fate tied with 1000-year-old monastery,"Wednesday, October 19, 2016","
Halji village, situated in north-western Nepal in Humla district, is the biggest in the Limi Valley. The river Limi cuts through the village situated at the edge of the valley, and it leaves a fertile basin for life to sustain.
It is the tenacity of the villagers, however, that even in the remoteness of the valley and the many impending threats always at large that life here finds strength to flourish.


The 1,000 year-old Halji monastery, perhaps, is the embodiment of this.
Researches, who have used carbon-dating, have concluded that the monastery is one of the oldest in the Himalayas. The monastery finds relevance in its antiquity and more so in its religious significance to the villagers, who mainly follow the Tibetan school of Buddhism.


But is is not only the religion that the villagers have in common with Tibet. Most are seasonal migrants to Taklakot in the Tibetan side where they work for additional income. The crops grown in the ice-fed waters of the Limi river are not enough for the whole year.


More life-threatening than challenges of food, however, is glacial flash floods that ravage the village and take away chunks of fertile land every year. The flooding occurs in June without fail and the villagers have all but started to adapt with it.


Amidst all this is the crumbling two-storied monastery complex. As if lack of proper conservation was not challenge enough, the earthquake last year left a noticeable damage to the monastery.
The villagers see their fate in that of the monastery. Some even believe that they can flourish only if the monastery survives the test of time.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tibet-border-village-sees-fate-tied-1000-year-old-monastery.html,travel
A world across the river Rapti,"Tuesday, October 18, 2016","Sauraha is not the best place to know the Terai jungles. But if it’s your first time going into the wild, if you want to go just to check something off a to-do list, if you are not keen on walking, riding, or waiting for hours to get a glimpse of a rare wild animal, then Sauraha might be the ideal destination.
Sauraha is a sybarite’s vision of retreat planted at the edge of wilderness. As beads of water slide down your beer bottle, a rhino saunters on the grassland across the river from you. All it takes to cross the Rapti River, the natural fence between the village and the jungle, is a ten-second glide on a dugout canoe. On the gravelly bank on the other side, you can walk past open-mouthed crocodiles and gharials lying motionless (if it’s early morning), warming their bodies in the sun.
These are sights that are available even to the laziest visitor, those who do not wish to increase the distance between his table beside the river and himself to more than a hundred meters. But another, wilder world awaits anyone willing to go further. That can be done on foot, with a guide or two leading the way. Or you can get into a jeep and drive into the sal vastness. Then there is the regal way: elephant rides.


For sheer excitement and palpable danger, walking remains the thing to do. I did that once with two friends. We had two guides with us who, in the outsider’s innocence, we believed to be wise. One was a greenhorn and the other, we found after a while, was pickled. What followed was a comic trespass into a wilderness. The drunken guide led us on a narrow trail along the high river bank, stopping once in a while to pick up a bleached bone or horn. His young colleague objected to this blatant violation of national park rules. “It’s only for my collection,” the older jungle man had replied.
Whether it was the drink or the desire to expand his collection, the guide led us straight into grassland so high and dense that we could only see a couple of feet at a time. We survived the grassland traverse to emerge on the other side. There a wooden machan, or tower, stood out in the sea of grass like a lighthouse. We climbed it, scanned the swathe of grass for wildlife, then got word from the bone collector that it was time to end our guided tour. Walking back we saw a jungle fowl pecking at the jeep track in front of us. With that, our foray into the wilderness was over.
On my second trip, I decided to go for a bird-watching trip with two veterans of the trade. Our walk lasted two hours and in that time we spotted 31 species of birds, including the Woolly-necked Stork, Black Ibis, Darter, Pied Kingfisher, Common Sandpiper, Peregrine Falcon and Crested Serpent Eagle (these two engaged in an aerial duel, possibly over a nesting site), Black-shouldered Kite, Hodgson’s Bushchat (male and female), Purple Heron, Lesser Adjutant, Black Bittern and Bronze-winged Jacuna. I remarked to the guides how lucky we had been, and he replied that we would have seen a lot more if we had set out earlier in the morning!


I could have walked on and on, deeper into the wilderness, or spent more time watching a lone Lesser Adjutant pace the edge of a marsh, or tracking pugmarks on the sand. But our trip was over. We had got our money’s worth, but I wanted to linger in a place whose chief beauty was making me feel out of place. Then the little stretch along the Rapti with its sprout of concrete came into view. Dugout canoes were drifting downriver, Bollywood songs blasting out of restaurants.
I have never been able to reconcile myself to the sight of Sauraha, never understood why there is loud music in a place literally a stone’s throw away from a vast wilderness. Perhaps Sauraha is one last illustration of the craziness of the human world before the wild world begins. With that thought in mind I settle into a beach chair on the bank of the river in the dusk, gazing west into the jungle, and grateful for that unspoiled patch. ■

Head south on the Mahendra Highway from Narayanghat. Some 13 km later you will arrive at Tandi Bazaar (also known as Sauraha Chok), from where you need to turn right. Sauraha is 6 km from there.


Elephant Rides
Less polluting than a jeep and less dangerous than a jungle walk, an elephant ride is arguably the best way to move in forests that have tigers and rhinos. The fun side of these giants is on display around mid-day when their mahouts bring them to the river for a bath. For a small fee you can sit on a pachyderm and let it spray you with water shot from its trunk.
Canoe
There are fewer things more calming than gliding down the Rapti in a long canoe in the morning. It’s also a great way to get close to mugger crocodiles and gharials.
Cycling
Hire a cycle from any of Sauraha’s several bike shops and pedal to the elephant breeding center or the Tharu Cultural Museum.
Birdwatching
Birdwatchers are in for a treat in the forest near Sauraha as it has several types of habitats, from grasslands to marshes. Even on a bad day you will see several of Chitwan National Park’s total of 540 species of birds.
Jungle Walks
Walking in the jungle is the best way to get a feel of the jungle. Adrenaline levels barely drop when you have wild animals calling out or crashing into the thicket near you. There are some 50 mammal species in Chitwan, which include tigers, elephants and rhinos, and lesser known species such as jungle cat, wild dog, gaur, and serow.
Elephant Breeding Center
A visit to the Elephant Breeding Center is like watching a series of home videos of the gentle giants. You see them eating rugby-ball-sized capsules of wheat grains and sugar packed in grass. There are glimpses into their personal hygiene as they spray dust on their bodies. And there is always the delightful sight of baby elephants running around

Royal Park Hotel has lovely cottages with spacious rooms and quaint interiors. It has a hefty price tag though. Chitwan Gaida Lodge and Jungle Safari Lodge offer comfortable rooms at comparatively lower prices.

Although guides in Sauraha are trained, they can sometimes put you at risk in their zeal to increase animal sightings. You should be vigilant and not allow guides to lead you into dangerous situations. Let them know if they are being reckless.

For jungle walks, the author recommends Tek Bahadur Gurung, better known as Thagu Dai (9845580098; 977-056-580189; [email protected]). For birdwatching trips, there is the affable and highly knowledgeable Krishna Pariyar (9865026412; [email protected]).

To western Nepal’s ‘New Lumbini’ in 5 photos,"Monday, October 3, 2016","After an adventure-filled overnight journey from Kathmandu you reach Birendranagar in Surkhet, one of western Nepal’s commerce hubs.
The town is from where food supplies reach rural Karnali, one of the most underdeveloped parts of Nepal. The city is also the place to go for people living in Dailekh, Jajarkot and Acham districts. It is also home to a domestic airport from where regular flights connect major towns across the country.
But one landmark that defines the city is the famous Bulbule Taal (pictured above). Although Bulbule is not big as the Fewa or the Rupa, it captures the imagination of western Nepal.


It is said that Surkhet is like an open museum. It is where the Panche Baza is still played on special occasions as locals clad in daura surwal dance to the tune of the Paisari.


Around a 30 minute drive from Birendranagar lies Kankrebihar, dubbed Nepal’s ‘Second Lumbini’. The site is rich in ancient Buddhist architecture. A plan to renovate the area and open it for tourists is likely to be completed next year.


When you reach Kankrebihar, you meet local artisans renovating the monuments. They combine their traditional knowledge with individual artistic talent to breathe new life into the monuments.


The famous Deutibajai Temple also lies in Surkhet. Each year thousands of devotees throng the temple to seek blessings from the goddess.

The city of Birendranagar has emerged as melting pot of various cultures from western Nepal. The iconic clocktower in central Birendranagar is a testament of the city’s growing importance, not only in the west, but also in all of Nepal.

"In Nepal’s medieval Newar town Bandipur, a pedestrian’s utopia","Sunday, October 2, 2016","Dumré, a stereotypical Nepali town close to the highway, is a picture of mercantile zeal.
It’s an assault on the eyes (piles of pickaxes and chains and pots, plastic wares to back up an invasion) and the ears (blaring horns is the town’s background score). I have been there a couple of times and the only thing I have found pleasing is an archaic diesel hose (with a marigold garland around it, as though in reverence to its age) and a corner at the western end of town from where, on clear days, you can see the mountains.
Perhaps that is the point of Dumré, a settlement existing to demonstrate the folly of haphazard growth. The strip of road some two hundred meters long, with shops on either side, is a warning to towns: Don’t let it get to this.
A place like Dumré rouses a desire to escape. And there is a perfect getaway near Dumré.
***
Bandipur is that refuge from those buffets of claxons and vehicle fumes and garish signboards and storefronts. The medieval Newar town came about in much the same way as Dumré: it was established on a major trade route connecting the Terai to the hills to eventually Tibet. But that is about as much the two places have in common.


The bus ride to Bandipur is something of a clue to the destination’s character. Goats and big dokos are crammed into the small buses that ply the windy road up to the hill town. En route is the spectacle that is common in Nepal’s hills: rows of hills like blue frozen waves and beyond them the wall of snow. Buses stop at the edge of town, as vehicles are prohibited to enter the town. What awaits you in Bandipur is a wide street lined with medieval houses, their facades smothered by an explosion of bougainvillea. Wheels seem yet to be invented.
What you cannot do (or do in peace) in Kathmandu’s ancient sites is everyday life in Bandipur. You can stand below an old Newar style house and admire its beauty and not have a petulant motorcyclist shatter the spell with his horn. Pedestrians have the street to themselves.
Bandipur the prosperous trading town shriveled when the Prithivi Highway was built at the foot of the hill in the 1960s. Eventually the highway killed it altogether. The sound of Tibetans and Nepalis haggling over the prices of goods grew faint then slowly died away. Most of the residents left, opting for the promise that was Narayangadh.


In a way, it was the highway that gave Bandipur its new life, that of a tourist town. Some of the locals, nostalgic as well as far-sighted folks, got together and decided to conduct an unprecedented experiment on their hometown. They banned all vehicles from entering the main settlement. Tourists sick of the sight of traffic began coming to Bandipur to unwind and get a taste of a pedestrian’s utopia. The same road that had trampled on Bandipur became an artery that fed its new avatar.
***
Being a town with a rich history, one that still has visual links to its past. The town is somewhat of an anomaly: it’s a thriving tourist town that is also a ghost town. The ghostly bit is its mercantile past. A good example of that is the open field northeast of the main street. Now popular with visitors as a place to watch the sunset from, it was once the open-air market where goods brought up from the Terai and down from Tibet were displayed. It’s easy to imagine weather-beaten, leathery faced Tibetans and dusky Newars and other Nepalis gesticulating, bargaining, exchanging goods and mirth on that ground.
A walk down the main street is one down the town’s memory lane. The houses are huge. Most have the traditional Newar style, characterised by ornately carved windows and struts. There are some imitations of the Rana palaces of Kathmandu. But every house is testimony to the town’s trading period.


History is often incomplete in Nepal without a dash of religion and myth. Bandipur has its share of these, too. The Khadga Mai Temple, which is tucked away on a hillock on the eastern edge of town, is a spiritual center as well as a repository of a mythical object. Inside the temple is a sword that belonged to Mukunda Sen, the 16th–century king of Palpa. The sword, which is shown to the public once a year during Dashain, is believed to have been gifted to the king by Shiva.
With a past like Bandipur’s, rich and preserved in many ways, it’s easy to fall under a spell and lose sense of the outer world. The past is the hardest thing to forget in Bandipur, and the presence of a world with vehicles and fumes the easiest to forget.

A major trade route may no longer run through it but Bandipur is still close to the road linking Kathmandu to one of the biggest tourist destinations of Nepal: Pokhara. This means that there are countless buses, both basic and luxurious ones collectively called ‘tourist bus,’ and microbuses that ply the route every day. Hop into any vehicle headed for Pokhara, get off at Dumré, and take the buses that depart every 30 minutes or so from there for Bandipur, a 30-minute ride.


Siddha Gufa
Siddha Gufa is a subterranean wonder, with huge stalagmites, unique rock formations, pits dozens of feet deep, and a thriving population of bats. The cave is 50m-high and 437m-deep—the biggest in Nepal. Besides the guided tour of the cave, you can also abseil through a hole in the cave’s roof.
Carry a good headlamp (you get one with the purchase of a ticket at the entrance, but it’s not very good quality) and enough drinking water for a trip to the cave. It’s best to visit the cave on your last day in Bandipur. That way, after you have explored the cave, you can walk down to Bimalnagar on the highway and catch a bus. It’s a steep descent to Bimalnagar from the cave, so if you’re not into walking, this is not for you.
Tundikhel
This was where traders gathered and did business in the old days. That sight is no longer there, but the spectacular view of the mountains remains. It’s a memorable sight to watch Himalayan giants like Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhare, Langtang Lirung, Manaslu and Ganesh Himal coated in the evening sunlight.
Thani Mai Temple
This is a small shrine located on a hill at the western end of town. The blessing of the goddess is not the only reward for climbing there; the hilltop offers a sweeping view of the mountains and the valley below.
Bindebasini Temple
A lovely example of Newar architecture, this small, two-story Durga temple adorns the eastern end of the main street.
Silkworm farm
For a glimpse of the silk-making process, head down the road to the silk farm.
Paragliding
There are a couple of paragliding flights a day from Bandipur, offering the chance to enjoy the sunset from the sky.

In its modern, touristy avatar Bandipur is basically one big boulevard full of restaurants and cafes. The advice is simple: walk into any restaurant that seems right to you. Bandipur’s cooks won’t disappoint.

To see all the sites in and around Bandipur you need at least two nights in this historic settlement. If you have cash to burn, try the exquisite Gaun Ghar Resort, which has wonderful views of the mountains. Stay at the Khadgamai Guest House & Restaurant if you want something cheaper. The cheapest lodgings are available away from the main bazar, at the eastern and western ends of town.

Perhaps to stay true to its reputation as a town stuck in time, Bandipur does not have an ATM. So carry enough cash to last your stay.

Finding wilderness at Chitwan’s Beeshazar Taal,"Sunday, September 25, 2016","Riding in the misty, nippy autumn morning, we arrived at a rusty iron gate. The gate was locked and so was the small hut just behind it, the ticket counter for entry to Beeshazar Tal.
It was already lit, but it seemed it would be a while before anyone would come to open the gate. My friends and I had arrived there before dawn just so that we could be at the lake at the earliest. We decided to go in anyway; we would pay for the tickets on our way out. We climbed over the gate and began the walk toward the lake that translates as “Twenty Thousand Lakes.”
I was carrying in my head an image of Beeshazar Tal: a patch of deforested sal forest that was interesting only because humans did not inhabit it. And at first sight it was not much different from that image. The lake was not aesthetically appealing.
Soot-colored tree trunks, limbless and leafless, stood in the water, looking like some kind of installation art on the theme of impermanence. Coots glided soundlessly, foraging among the plants. When spooked, they took off in that beautiful motion of flapping wings and trailing feet that etched an ephemeral runway on the water’s surface.
This, of course, was hardly exceptional. But what made the place appealing was the timing. We had got there when the jungle was coming to life.
***
A small wonky wooden bridge spanned a canal that ran between the lake and the marshy meadows to the south. We found a different world on the other side of that bridge.
A graveled road ran between the canal and the wetlands. The canal was some seven feet lower than this road, a dank trough filled with fallen rufous and yellow leaves. Patches of water showed through the leafy carpet. The tops of trees on both banks leaned inward, creating an arched canopy that turned the canal into a tunnel. Standing on the water level, I looked upstream and it was a surreal sight, still and silent save for the occasional leaf that fell like a whisper.


There was too little water in the canal to push through the carpet of leaves. In fact, it was only by descending to the water level that you could see the water. My shadow cast on the water, and I saw a tiny turtle swim in a panic for the shelter of leaves. Downstream, from where I stood taking in the sight, a puny kingfisher, piqued by my presence, became histrionic, going teep-teep-teep and darting to and fro from a branch. It was clear it needed solitude to perform its meditative method of fishing. If the definition of a wilderness is a place unused to humans, the jitteriness of the turtle, the kingfisher and the coots were all evidences I was in a wilderness.
It was then that I noticed a dark figure in the tree a little upstream. It was a Crested serpent Eagle. I moved forward stealthily to get a photo of the predator. It got within range of my camera, but as soon as I raised my camera the eagle flew away, muttering, I am sure, profanities in ‘Eaglish’.
For the next ten minutes the eagle and I played this game of chase and flight. Every time I thought I had him, the eagle waited until the very last moment before flying away. It was a hopeless case of pursuing a beautiful creature, and the eagle was in no mood for posing for me. I gave up after a while.
But I liked it down in the canal, so I lingered there. As I was photographing the leaves on the water, I saw through the corner of my eye something black descend down the embankment into the water. I looked up and saw a sambar doe saunter across the canal and up the opposite bank.


The doe hadn’t seen me. I was concealed by a tree’s exposed roots. Now I had another subject for photography. I climbed hastily up to the road, afraid my friends, who were chatting and walking on the road, would spook the doe before I got to her. I motioned to my friends to keep quiet and pointed down the road. Within seconds the doe appeared on the road. She crossed it and began munching on a bush. The bend on the road afforded us good cover under which to advance toward her.
We made some progress but when the road straightened out, our cover was gone and without it the deer quickly noticed us. In one leap, it crashed into the dense undergrowth. It felt like a dream had just ended.
***
We walked on and came upon a herd of chital browsing. Immediately they stopped grazing and looked up, ears cocked, eyes locked on us. It took them a minute or two to realise that we meant no harm. Then they went back to grazing. The place was turning out to be wilder than I had expected. I began to entertain thoughts of a tiger sauntering across the road—or at least roaring somewhere in the vicinity.


Almost in the same instant that I first noticed the place as a possible tiger habitat, a motorbike sputtered toward us. The outer world moved in to claim a share of this natural domain. We took the motorbike’s arrival as our cue to leave.
When we crossed the wooden bridge back to Beeshazar Tal we saw a couple of uniformed high school students there. They were truants, some out on a date, others simply there to escape the confinement of classrooms. We had been privy to a magnificent early morning show on Nature, but now it was clearly the hour of love birds.


To get to Beeshazar Tal (also called Bis Hazari) from Narayanghat, head south on the main road, which is actually the Mahendra Highway. About eight kilometers later, you will arrive in a place called Tikauli. Turn right here, heading south-west. The entrance gate is another seven kilometers on a graveled road. There is another entry point further down the road. There is a small entry fee for the lake.


Mugger crocodiles have recently been reintroduced in the lake. The place now has a small population of these wily predators. Even though they are not the man-grabbing monsters portrayed in movies, it is always better not to venture too close to the water or try to get close to them for that selfie you want so badly.

Royal Century (00977-56-525865, www.royalcentury.com.np) is one of Narayanghat’s high-end hotels. If you are on a small budget, there is Hotel Satanchuli (00977-56-531930). It has the added advantage of being next door to the town’s bus station. It’s best to stay as close as possible to Beeshazar Tal, so that you don’t spend most of your early morning traveling there. Check for homestays in the villages near the lake.

Chasing a Himalayan sunrise at Poon hill,"Sunday, September 18, 2016","The bus wound further and further up into the hills until Pokhara’s Phewa Tal was no more than a silvery puddle in a bowl of green hills. Then the road descended into the northern side of the hill and we were on a road with a patina of dew.
The ticket collector called our stop. This was Nayapul, the starting point for the famed Poon Hill trek. Wai-Wai noodles and Snickers bars were conspicuous on the shelves of the few shops there. When we asked about the trail to Poon Hill, we were told to continue down the rutted dirt road we were on.
Poon Hill is almost intoned like a mantra when people in Nepal’s cities sit down to decide on a trekking destination. I had heard friends tell me about their friends who had gone there and had a swell time. Flip guidebooks and there would be a sizeable section on the trek. It was a travel agency’s most sellable trip. I was not so much enticed to go there as curious to know if it lived up to all the hype. And there was a part of me that hoped to find the place an utter exaggeration, so that every time someone named it as a wonderful trek, I’d retort, It’s overhyped!


Walking for some thirty minutes along a river, we came to an iron bridge festooned in prayer flags. Across the bridge was Birethanti, where a lovely choice was on offer: A dirt road for vehicles and a narrow flagstone trail. We paid our entry fees into the Annapurna Conservation Area. As we hung around the ticket booth perusing brochures, a man asked us where we were headed. Hilé, we told him. He sprang up from his chair and almost pushed us on to the trail. “What are you dillydallying here for then? You won’t get to Hilé in daylight if you don’t get going.” With that admonishment we stepped into Annapurna.
Within minutes we were seeing images that seemed to have leapt out from the brochures. We found ourselves walking through a village of slate-roofed houses, with protruding balconies oozing with bougainvillea and orange trumpet creeper. There were terraced fields and gurgling brooks, shepherds with their goats and villagers with contagious smiles bent under baskets of grass. But this was rustic charm, the walk like going from one village to the next. I expected a trek to be about rugged terrain, the less peopled the better. And where were the calf-killing climbs that are a prelude to silence-inducing vistas? We could have been walking on the outskirts of Kathmandu. As if to corroborate this view, a jeep stuffed with people grunted by once in a while.
There wasn’t enough of the wilderness to impart a sense of having got away. The only excitement I got in the first two hours after Birethanti was the sight of a waterfall and the fact that it was getting dark and we had no idea how far away we were from our night halt.


In the last shred of daylight, I saw a painted signboard with a name on it and an arrow pointing to a flight of stone stairs. At the top of the stairs was a sight to lift any trekker’s spirits: an entire street of traditional wooden houses, with signboards advertising shower and food and drinks. That night, heaven went by the name on the signboard: Hilé.
***
We got to the end of Hilé and sat on a large rock outside a wooden house. There was 14 hours of scheduled power cuts in Kathmandu then. Our eyes drifted to the wondrous sight of houses aglow with electric lights. A man came out wearing a white sash, a Dhaka topi, and a smile that seemed to be etched onto his face. This was the owner of the lodge, and the sash was part of the traditional Gurung dress. We decided to stay at his lodge. Three Brazilian women were already seated in the tiny dining room. The Gurung man was serenading them with Nepali songs in between sorties to the kitchen to haul in hors d’oeuvres and the local firewater made from millet. It was a scene from a classic evening on a trek.
The ‘trek’ part of the trek began the next day. First up was Tikhedhunga, a vision of sorts with a serpentine staircase going up to a gateway draped with orange trumpet creeper. There were mountains with powdery snow on them in the background. Up and up the stairs went and everything man-made in the landscape – villages, terraces, bridges – was dwarfed by hills and mountains. We had climbed no more than fifteen minutes after Tikhedhunga when we spotted a sparkling white peak peering from behind two intersecting ridges. It looked like a giant’s canine that had been doused in tooth bleach.


Shortly after the glimpse of the dazzling massif, we arrived in a small village called Banthanti. Here we saw the part of Machhapuchhre that is shaped like a fish’s tail. Then the mountains went out of view as we entered a forest. It felt like trekking through a land in hibernation. Snow lay everywhere — on steps, weighing down trees, carpeting bridges. We were the only things moving in it.
Bantering and sauntering we arrived in Ghorepani, our night halt. This was the “base camp” to Poon Hill. The first building one sees here trekking in from Tikhedhunga is a huge complex of stone houses with blue tin roofs that is redolent of British Raj era houses in Indian hill stations. The plume of smoke meandering heavenward from this building gave the impression that this was a place with a laid back way of life. Walking past it we saw that the building was a community health clinic. We arrived in Ghorepani just in time to catch the mountain tips glow and go out like embers.
People trek to Poon Hill for the sunrise. The trekker’s rite is to wake up in the dark, trudge up for half an hour to Poon Hill and wait there, shuddering in the cold, for the day’s first light to paint the mountains. My friends and I awoke several times in the night, but went back to sleep when we saw that it wasn’t time yet to head for the hill. In the end we slept through and awoke only when it was light. But we still went to Poon Hill. As we lumbered up the stone steps, made treacherous by the ice on it, we passed hordes of trekkers coming down. “We are going for the sunset,” I joked after one too many of them had looked at us and smiled bemused smiles.


We missed the sunrise, but we got an idea of why people brave the morning cold to walk up to the hill. Mountains make up the northern horizon, east to west. It was enough to be there, to stand before the mighty Himalayas, to gaze at peaks that one had seen on maps. Taking in this scene we didn’t feel for a second that we had missed out on something by sleeping past dawn. The only way you miss out on anything about Poon Hill is by not getting out of bed to trek there.

Buses leave at regular intervals for Baglung from the New Bus Park in Kathmandu. Although you can take a bus to Pokhara and then take another bus or a taxi to Nayapul, this takes up valuable time and costs more.



Day 1: Kathmandu to Nayapul to Hilé or Tikhedhunga
From the New Bus Park in Kathmandu, take the early morning bus to Baglung. You will need to get off at Nayapul then walk to Birethanti. Entrance fees need to be paid here. From Birethanti two hours of fast walking will get you to Hilé. Another 20-30 minutes if you wish to go on to Tikhedhunga.
Day 2: Hile/Tikhedhunga to Ghorepani
Although there is not much climbing in this day’s trek, the walk from Hilé or Tikhedhunga to Ghorepani takes almost eight to nine hours.
Day 3: Ghorepani to Tadapani
If you don’t want to take same route you came on, then there is the option of going via Tadapani. It’s a mostly downhill trek to Tadapani from Ghorepani. The trail can turn treacherous in winter when the snow freezes on the trail, turning it into an ice rink. Other than that, it’s a lovely walk through forests and ravines.
Day 4: Tadapani to Pokhara
It’s possible to go all the way to Pokhara from Tadapani in a single day, but you need to set out early in the morning. There is a chance Ghandruk’s beauty will cost you an hour or more. Actually the poster village of the Annapurna region deserves at least an entire day in the itinerary. But if you choose to go on there is a bus station of sorts an hour down the trail. You can take any of several jeeps or buses going to Pokhara from there.

Just its homeliness and owner’s banters are reason enough to stay at the Deepak Guesthouse in Hilé. In Ghorepani, stay at Hotel Tukuche Peak View for the luxury of mountain views from your bed.

"In Photos: As the flagship trek to the Himalayas, Everest is ready to welcome visitors","Thursday, September 15, 2016","As the trekking season comes near, photographer Bharat Bandhu Thapa visited the Everest region to document its beauty and diversity. With clear afternoons and balmy evenings, Nepal welcomes majority of its visitors to the Khumbu valley during the months of September-November.
This trekking season holds prominence in the light of the earthquake last year, which although had minimum effect on the region, made trekkers wary of visiting. But as these images tell, the region remains virtually the same with its characteristic beauty and appeal.
The flagship trek to the Himalayas is ready than ever to welcome visitors.

Shivapuri: The Hill of Longing,"Sunday, September 11, 2016","Shivapuri Hill, at least for me, has a magnetic pull. I sometimes catch a glimpse of it from a high point south of the Bagmati and feel a pang for the wilderness. If there has been a shower in the afternoon, the day’s last light turns it into the color of burnished copper, and the whole hill face becomes a huge hoarding board for wilderness.
And then the sight slips away as I descend into the snarl of Kathmandu’s traffic, to resume the daily struggles in the Valley floor. I must go there more often, I tell myself as I hang out the laundry on the terrace, and know at the back of my mind that I won’t anytime soon. But even without going there I feel there is something good in the air as long as there is forest cover on that hill.
Nature is tremendously lovable, but it’s a love that needs renewal, especially when you are trapped for days and weeks in the concrete labyrinth. Shivapuri is no exception to this. But it’s amazing that Kathmanduites prefer to wait for their long-desired trip to Chitwan National Park to happen rather than go to Shivapuri.
There are not many capital cities in the world that have a national park within an hour’s drive from its downtown, one outdoor sports business operator and long-time Shivapuri aficionado once reminded me. Perhaps that is why no one wants to go there. The idea of wilderness is inextricably – and in some people’s mind unalterably – bound to remoteness.
Shivapuri?
People give a dismissive laugh and go back to perusing blogs on Langtang National Park and Bardia’s jungles. Better to let plans for trips gather dust than to set foot on the quiet trails of a national park in your backyard.
You won’t see herds of wildlife in Shivapuri like you might in Chitwan. But that is not what you go there for. You go for the quiet. To hear brooks, and see a tiny crab on its edge, holding up his pincers like a boxer’s fists. There is birdsong, and the sudden rustling and scuttling and crashing made by spooked animals.


Ties with the sights and sounds and pace of life Kathmanduites are accustomed to are severed as soon as you enter the park at Pani Muhan, which is north of the famed temple of Budhanilkantha. Birdsongs seem to drip down on you. Trees arch over the graveled road, keeping it dank and dark year round. You hear the gurgling of streams long before you see them. A couple of times, there is a gap in the corridor of trees and you get a glimpse of Kathmandu. Then the trail snakes into the bowels of the forest again and all is green and quiet and smells of earth.
If you look up east from the clearing on the trail from where Kathmandu is visible, you see several slightly curved colorful strips. They are the prayer flags of the Nagi Gompa. When you look at Shivapuri from the Valley floor, the white block you see is this nunnery. It’s a sacred place, and people come here from all over Kathmandu. But for those who profess allegiance to the outdoors or have forsaken their devotion, if only for a day, to the frenetic faith called city life, this is simply a place to breathe in the mountain air, while away time in the dappled shade of a prayer flag-smothered tree or follow the eagles that seem to always hang around. Most times, all this happens with the soothing sound of dozens of nuns chanting mantras in the prayer hall in the background.


The monastery is also a resting place for those whose destination is Shivapuri’s peak (2,732m). Hikers, bikers and devotees have taken the wild edge off the section up to Nagi Gompa, but the trail up from there is wilder. Moisture and moss are everywhere. Old man’s beard dangles from tree limbs, giving the forest an eerie look, which is exacerbated by the faint light. It’s a lonely stretch, and a long walk to the next semblance of a human settlement.
It’s a bit of an exaggeration to call the two huts and a tiny stupa a settlement, but in the heart of the Shivapuri forest, out of view of any other place, the structures lift your soul. There is water and tea—if the occupants, a motley band of ascetics and laymen, are around. The peak is another half an hour’s taxing climb from there.
Shivapuri’s peak is an inviolate clearing in the forest. A shrine to the revered ascetic Shivapuri Baba sits in one corner. Across the clearing from it is an abandoned army post, a casualty of the civil war. A little below this ruin is a rock jutting out of the hill. It is to stand on this three foot ledge that hikers toil for hours.
When you lift your eyes north and see the snowy peaks against the blue skies your spirit is lifted too in knowing that there is a tiny spot near Kathmandu where you can come to renew your love affair with Nature.

Shivapuri National Park’s history began in the head of a high-ranking Rana, possibly the prime minister. It’s easy to picture the man gazing out of his palace window one day and his heart yearning for a hunting trip to the forested hill dominating the northern wall of the Valley. Or perhaps courtiers eager to please brought word of the forest to the north that was teeming with wild animals.
Whatever it was, Shivapuri became a hunting destination for the Ranas, who brought teams of dogs and servants to flush out their quarries. They wanted the abundance of wildlife only for themselves, so the forest was declared a private hunting reserve.
So Shivapuri was saved from the growing city’s ravenous appetite for timber by default. Further protection came in 1975, when the Shivapuri Watershed Development Board bestowed on it the status of a protected area. Shivapuri’s survival as a green haven was guaranteed in 2003, when it was declared a national park.

Shivapuri National Park covers an area of 159 square kilometers. This is one big playground for outdoor enthusiasts, whether they are into hiking, mountain biking, trail running, camping, birdwatching or rock climbing. There are even the lesser known sports of canyoning and bouldering.

If you like hiking, you will love Shivapuri. There are several destinations that you can hike to, depending on your walking speed and stamina. Nagi Gompa, which is 3 km from the park entrance at Pani Muhan, is ideal for a relaxed walk in the woods. Hardy walkers can go all the way up to the Shivapuri Peak, which will bring views of mountains hovering over mist.
There is also Bagdwar, the Bagmati’s source. Then there is a long hike that covers the breath of the national park, from Pani Muhan to Chisapani, the village on the popular Gosainkunda trek.The “Café Behind the House” (name translated from Nepali) is the place to get your fix of Newar cuisine. Also try the local yogurt while in Dhulikhel. Several of the tea shops keep a stock.

Birds are the first ones to welcome you to the forest. It takes more effort to not be a birder in Shivapuri than being one. The park is home to species like the Hill Partridge, Wedge-tailed Green Pigeon, Kalij Pheasant, Nepal Fulvetta, Asian Paradise-flycatcher, Rufous-bellied Woodpecker, Mountain Scops Owl, Yellow-bellied Bush Warbler, Maroon-backed Accentor and Grey-winged Blackbird. A total of 318 species have been recorded in the park, including Nepal’s only endemic bird, the Spiny Babbler.If it is seclusion and sweeping mountain views you are in Dhulikhel for, then the Dhulikhel Village Resort is hard to beat. If you are on a small budget, the Langtang View Resort is a good choice.

Canyoning is fun in the form of water and slippery rock. Take any of Chhango’s, the only company offering canyoning trips in Shivapuri, several packages, and expert guides will take you down one waterfall after another on a rope.

Shivapuri has 19 species of mammals, including the rare clouded leopard. The park also has 102 species of butterflies. This faunal richness combined with the magnificent mountain panorama visible from Shivapuri peak makes the park a wonderful destination for photography.

The Nagi Gompa and nearby areas are terrorised by rapacious monkeys who are in the habit of snatching food from people. There have been cases of monkeys biting people to get their food, so never open food packages while in this area or when monkeys are around.

Dhulikhel: At historical Nepal-China trade town Himalayan panorama is successful commodity,"Monday, September 5, 2016","I’ve never quite understood what prompts locals of a place not too far from Kathmandu to inform visitors, almost as though it were a selling point, that Kathmandu (or its lights) is visible from a certain vantage point in their village, especially when the visitor has come to escape Kathmandu.
At night in such places, I like to walk along a dirt road with fireflies teeming in the bushes like electric lights or gaze at the starry skies, not try and locate landmarks of Kathmandu.
At least that is something locals of Dhulikhel won’t tell you–not that you would take note even if someone did.
It’s a unique combination of modernisation and medieval culture, like a town frozen in the midst of a metamorphosis. There are concrete houses and large resorts, but there are also old Newar houses with carved wooden struts and tiled roofs. There is a major highway adjacent to the town.
In town, there are old doorways leading to small courtyards with stupas and shrines. On a road bristling with painted signboards for hotels and resorts, there is a stairway descending into the dank depths of an ancient stone spigot. The idea seems to be that there is always a door, a trail or a flight of stairs that can take you away from the commotion of a town built beside a highway.
Dhulikhel’s mercantile past is all but forgotten now; it’s much easier to imagine it as a corollary to the building of the Kodari Highway that links Kathmandu to the border town of Tatopani. But Dhulikhel came about because it lay on the old trade route from Kathmandu to Lhasa. Besides history books, that aspect of the town’s past lives on in old timers, most of whom frequent the old square, smoking and chatting on temple steps.


The square is a citadel for a way of life, even an era. It’s surrounded by–but hasn’t yet surrendered to–concrete houses four or five stories high. Some of the talk there is quite sensational. “You are too young to remember this, but Tibet was once part of Nepal,” an old man told me one day at the square. His tone was not the uncertain one of a person propagating hearsay; he spoke with the complete faith of a man passing on a story told by a grandparent.
I could picture the old man seated in the same square on a sunny winter morning and his grandfather, just back from the long trip to Lhasa, regaling the kids with phantasmal tales about Tibet. I didn’t tell the old man he was wrong. Even the historical fallacy was tinged with nostalgia: who other than that man would believe such a tale?
But even if the trade route is long gone, there is still the hugely successful commodity that is the Himalayan panorama. Resorts and hotels, all selling a room or a balcony with mountain views, are the big business in Dhulikhel. And it’s a lovely thing to be in a room that throbs with the buzzing of cicadas from the forest outside at night and has a window that frames snowy pinnacles in the morning.


The proliferation of resorts might worry those who seek to escape Kathmandu. But there is still enough of the countryside that hasn’t been claimed by the town or resorts. The trail to the Kali Temple is testimony to this. The stairway that climbs up to it is a path into the wilderness. The flagstone stairway is the only man-made structure there for a while. Bird songs, colorful insects, and a lush forest engulf anyone who goes up the steps.
The next man-made structure will give you pause. It’s a statue of the Buddha. Sitting squat in a patch is the fifty-foot image of the man who encouraged each person to find the clearing in the metaphorical forest. It’s a beautiful place to take in the landscape – milky fog roiling in slow motion in the valley below, wavy hills stretching end to end – and indulge in the self-congratulatory act of gauging one’s progress up the hill.
Higher still and thus offering an even better view is the Kali Temple. The shrine has lost some of its original charm because of the concrete structure that now houses it. But concrete is in the minority here, a speck in a sea of earth and trees. As far as the eye can see there are hills, some still carpeted from base to summit with trees, others terraced, some scarred. It is that typical scene in Nepal’s hills of nature, and man’s mark on it. And above it all, soaring like beings too pure to be violated, the Himalayas. But, most importantly, Kathmandu is nowhere in sight.

Dhulikhel is 30 kilometers from Kathmandu. You can take any of the several buses plying the route from the Old Bus Park in Kathmandu.


Old Town Square
Arriving here is to go back in time. Temples and shrines fill this centuries old courtyard, Hari Siddhi and the Vishnu Temple being the most notable. Elderly people, holders of oral histories, congregate here. They need little encouragement to unravel their yarns of fantastic tales, some of which will need to be taken with more than a pinch of salt. A short walk uphill from the western end of this square will bring you to the Bhagwati Shiva Temple.
Shiva Temple
This inconspicuous little Shiva temple, known as Gaukhureshwor Mahadev, is tucked in a ravine some two kilometers southeast of the old town center.
The Giant Buddha
The huge Buddha statue is located a quarter of the way up to the Kali Temple, in a place called Shanti Ban. The trail begins from the small park east on the road from the town center. More than twenty peaks are visible from here, including Langtang Lirung (7,234 m), Ganesh Himal (7,406 m), Dorje Lakpa (6,966 m), Gauri Shankar (7146 m) and Melungtse (7181 m).

The “Café Behind the House” (name translated from Nepali) is the place to get your fix of Newar cuisine. Also try the local yogurt while in Dhulikhel. Several of the tea shops keep a stock.

If it is seclusion and sweeping mountain views you are in Dhulikhel for, then the Dhulikhel Village Resort is hard to beat. If you are on a small budget, the Langtang View Resort is a good choice.


There is a place to go to from Dhulikhel in almost every direction. And these places are all interconnected by roads, so you can always visit them on your way back to Kathmandu. A good choice for a side trip is Namo Buddha. Besides its sacredness, this Buddhist pilgrimage site has the added attraction of being surrounded by some of the most picturesque landscape.
If you are into hiking, you might want to try the walk down from Namo Buddha to the medieval Newar town of Panauti.
If you want to visit the Palanchowk Bhagwati head east on the Araniko Highway towards Panchkhal. The famous shrine is 22 km from Dhulikhel.
There is also the option of a long walk (you can also drive or cycle there) from Dhulikhel to the village of Patlekhet. This place is worth visiting not merely for its rustic appeal but for its wonderful organic farms. Notable among these are Everything Organic Nursery and Hasera Farm. Many of the farms here also have homestay facilities.

"How the pressures of geopolitics, globalisation and climate change are impacting the Yak","Tuesday, August 30, 2016","The yak is one of the most enduring symbols of the high Himalayas. Whether you visit Tibet, Bhutan, India or Nepal, you will inevitably find tourist shops selling t-shirts with the animals depicted on them. As the largest animal on the Tibetan plateau – it can be as tall as 2.2 metres at the shoulder, and weigh up to a thousand kilogrammes – and its surrounding regions, the yak is a “flagship species”, and indicates the health of the ecosystem within which it lives. Unfortunately data indicates that the yak is in trouble, and it is in trouble for reasons that affect most of the countries in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.
In May 2016, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) published a report titled, Yak on the Move: Transboundary Challenges and Opportunities for Yak Raising in a Changing Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. This publication is based on research papers that were submitted at the 5th International Conference on the Yak held at China’s Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences August 27-31, 2014. ICIMOD has been organising such conferences since 1997, and this time the co-organiser was the Yak and Camel Foundation of Germany. The conference allowed people from all the countries where the yak is raised, from Afghanistan to where India meets Myanmar.


The yak is a high altitude animal, usually found 2,000-5,000 metres above sea level. It is superbly adapted to the climate of the area in which it lives, which includes conditions of “cold winter, low oxygen content, high solar radiation, and cyclical nutrition with short growing seasons”. Of the estimated 15 million yaks in the world, 90% live on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region, within Chinese borders.
According to the report, “The yak population in Bhutan, India and Nepal has shown a declining trend in recent years. Pal (2003) reported a marked decline in the yak population in India from 132,000 in 1977 to 51,000 in 1997… In Nepal, the total number of yak and yak hybrids in 2013 was 65,980 (MOAD 2013), a marked decline from the estimated 200,000 yak and yak hybrids in 1961 (Joshi 2003).”
Read Also: Climate change: Women from Rasuwa find themselves at the receiving end
There are multiple reasons for this decline. One of the main reasons is the harsh lives that the yak herders live. Yak herders come from the most marginalised of communities, and while the yak may be adapted to the conditions, humans prefer comfort. As globalisation offers more opportunities, the young men of the mountain communities raising yaks find other jobs, and other places to go. As other avenues for economic progress open up for “previously remote yak-raising areas, people have begun to question whether this traditional lifestyle can be maintained.”


Yaks have adapted to high altitudes, but not to human-made lines on the map. As wars and conflicts have led to the closing of borders, the yaks outside Chinese borders are “thought to be suffering from inbreeding due to the lack of availability of new yak germplasm from the original yak area, the Tibetan Plateau, during the past few decades, and the resultant practice of prolonged use of the same bull within herds.” As such, the yaks are smaller, and more prone to disease. These problems cannot be dealt with except with a transboundary lens, because the problems that created them are transnational in scope.
One paragraph perfectly captures how the yak herders in Little Pamir in Afghanistan have suffered.
In the 1890s, Badakhshan was divided into two by Russia and Great Britain, and the Kyrgyz people in Little Pamir were separated. This border was then strictly restricted after the 1930s by the Soviet Union. After the 1950s, the border between Afghanistan and China in the Wahkan Corridor was closed, leaving no possibility for the Wahki and Kyrgyz herders to get new yak germplasm from outside. The limited trade between Pakistan and Afghani Wakhan was also blocked after the 1990s due to terrorism concerns. The Wakhan corridor and the Afghan Pamir have thus become an isolated ‘island’ in terms of the exchange of yak genetic resources and the yak husbandry economy.


As borders have closed, and climate change has led to uneven production of grass, the yak herders find themselves fenced into grasslands which are under greater pressure. The only silver lining for them is that, as the Himalayas warm up, some types of vegetation will reproduce at a better rate. Unfortunately the yak, which cannot stand high temperatures, may not be able to enjoy the new snacks.
It is not all bad news, though. The papers include looking at interbreeding between yak and local species of cows in Gilgit-Baltistan, and also how China, which hosts the main population of yaks, can look at improving production while being sensitive to local community concerns related to culture and religion. One of the papers from China also looks at genome mapping of both wild and domesticated yak. Given that it hosts the largest population of the animal, and the resources it has, it is possible that as China helps open the new Silk Road, it may also show the way to preserve the majestic yak in cooperation with its neighbours.

A Mountain Retreat in Namo Buddha,"Sunday, August 28, 2016","The meeting would have made for a wonderful painting.
My companion and I ran into two Buddhist monks, stopped for a brief chat, and parted ways; we towards a monastery and the monks on their way to the febrile city.
In the background to this coming together of tonsured monks in burgundy robes and hikers in quick-dry T-shirts was a large monastery of golden roofs and curly eaves perched on a hill. There was a certain amount of romanticism, I felt, in meeting monks on your way to a monastery mentioned in holy texts. And that was why I felt like being in a classic painting about a pilgrimage.
That was our first glimpse of the monastery at Namo Buddha. It was in Namo Buddha, according of legend, that a young prince had been so moved by the sight of a hungry tigress, about to devour her own famished cubs, that he fed them his own flesh and eventually gave himself to the tigress.
Though this tale of compassion inspired people to travel here for pilgrimage, they could not shake off their fears of wild animals inhabiting the dense forest. So to allay their fears, pilgrims began chanting “Namo Buddhaya,” a mantra meaning “I take refuge in the Buddha,” while traveling through the forest. That is how the place got its name.


I had heard from friends that a lama I had known was now living in the monastery. When I inquired about the lama, however, I learned that he had been in retreat for two years already and would be for another two. My companion and I decided to look around.
It became clear quickly why the lama had gone on a retreat. The monastery and its surroundings were like a buffer zone against the distractions of the world—at least the visual ones. The website of the Thrangu Tashi Yangtse Monastery extols Namo Buddha as a place that “inspires one’s faith; renunciation and weariness with samsara naturally arise.”
It didn’t inspire that kind of feeling in me, but like any quiet place set in the midst of unspoiled natural beauty, it did remind me of the need to escape more often from the samsara of concrete structures. I was hooked more to the copper-blue of a verditer flycatcher, which made sorties from its perch on an electric wire to grab insects.
We then climbed the stairs to the main prayer room. On the wall along the stairs were plaques inscribed with the aphorisms of one of the world’s happiest man, the Dalai Lama. Of forgiveness, a word that he has spent a lifetime trying to prove is more than a mere ideal, he had said:
It would be much more constructive if people tried to understand their supposed enemies. Learning to forgive is much more useful than merely picking up a stone and throwing it at the object of one’s anger, the more so when the provocation is extreme for it is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.
The words took me to some place higher—if only for the duration of the seconds it took me to read them.
The stairs brought us to a red door with minute colorful patterns on its frame. From inside came the clang of cymbals and the thud of drums, accompanied by the guttural chanting of Buddhist scriptures. A prayer session was underway.
Visitors were welcome here. A couple of tourists were seated on a low bench, some of them turning prayer beads in their hands, other transfixed by the sounds and sights of a monastery prayer room. We found seats behind a row of monks poring over scriptures. Two monks appeared a little later, one carrying a large kettle, the other placing clay cups before monks and visitors. The tea had a scorched taste, and it blended with the earthy taste of the cup to produce a memorable flavor.

We left the room after a while of listening to the chanting and page turning. From the large balcony, too, the landscape was of the paintings one sees in shops in Kathmandu: snowy mountains, verdant valleys, endless rows of hills, terraces bristling with corn plants and villages of thatch-roofed houses.
We watched the distant hills with their wreaths of fog; nearer, the hills were smothered in prayer flags, the incantations fluttering away to the heavens on a cool mountain breeze. Then we went on a kora around the monastery, which had the odd feel of a guided tour.
We came down to the other side of the monastery and went into a dark hallway. On one side of this passage was a door with several dozen shoes and flip-flops outside—another prayer session. We found a secluded balcony. There, lulled by the cool wind, the zealous chants of novice monks and a quiet that is common in monasteries, we fell asleep, me with an open book in my lap, the proverbial lazy student.
When we awoke, both of us were a little embarrassed at having succumbed to sleep in a place associated with awakenings. What was it that had induced sleep in a place where one tries to keep the senses awake for any spiritual windfall? For us the place was a true gompa, a Tibetan word meaning “remote place,” for it actually isolated us from all worldly cares. That is perhaps the power of a sacred place, to screen out the commotion of the outer world so that people may focus on their inner landscape. Besides, as the monastery’s website states (and consoles lazy folks like me):
“In the supreme place of a solitary mountain retreat, any activity is virtuous.”

To get to Namo Buddha, take a bus to Dhulikhel from the Old Bus Park. From there you can either take the buses that go all the way up to the monastery or to the junction from where the road to the monastery branches off. If you have taken the latter option, you will need to walk up from the junction to the monastery. The thing to remember is to inquire about the last bus down from Namo Buddha.
Meal with Monks

The Thrangu Tashi Yangtse Monastery offers chance to spend some time with its resident monks outside the prayer rooms. At the monastery’s restaurant you can eat your meals with the monks. The monastery also has a guesthouse. But it is usually full, so it’s always best to book rooms in advance if you plan to stay overnight. To make reservations, visit www.namobuddha.org.
Where to Stay

There are several lodges at the foot of the Namo Buddha hill, near the old stupa. Lodges and teahouses also abound on the road up to the monastery. There are also some small villages on this route. It’s worth inquiring about homestay facilities there.

A short hike west from Namo Buddha is the medieval town of Panauti. The town is one of the few places remaining in the Kathmandu Valley that had managed to salvage its character and lifestyle in the face of modernizations. It’s a must see if you are into medieval history and culture. Those capable of long walks may want to return to Kathmandu via Lakuri Bhanjhyang, a village on the southeastern rim of the Valley.

The rustic utopia that is Dandagaon

The rustic utopia that is Dandagaon,"Sunday, August 21, 2016","It was barely ten minutes before pedestrians were sauntering across the road on which I was driving. Soon kalij pheasants, a pine marten, and a deer were bounding and scuttling across the dappled road. The place had the idyllic and untouched look of a world accessible only through a magical wardrobe. And this was a mere six kilometers from the snarl of Kathmandu’s traffic, just a turn and a loop (so smooth was the ride) from the buzzing Budhanilkantha market.
Crossing the Bishnumati River over a somewhat archaic looking iron bridge was a crossing of a subtle border. Urbanity kept to the other side of the bridge; across it, the place was semi-rustic. The evidence of this was clearest in the careless pedestrians, their nonchalance a hint of the thin traffic their neighborhoods were used to. The women were dressed in traditional Nepali blouses, which is as sure a sign as there is that one is in the countryside. They sat on small courtyards, surrounded by corn probably harvested from their fields.
This, too, was left behind when the road climbed abruptly and wound into a copse of pine. Entering that natural tunnel, it became cool. Below us, a large swath of paddy fields, a sea of eye-pleasing green, lay between the hill and Kathmandu’s rapacious growth—a barrier between the incoming concrete wave. It was a sight that induced a slight chuckle: there were places after all that were out of reach of the city’s tentacles.


A small sentry post appeared on the road: we were now entering the Shivapuri National Park. Formalities completed and pleasantries exchanged with the soldiers on duty, we continued onward, passing through a semi-dark stretch of road under arching trees to arrive in the meticulously maintained garden of the Army Command & Staff College. It looked more like a princely estate, complete with white Roma stone planters. It could easily have been a place to train people in the lifestyle of royalties.
Then another drastic change in scenery. The paved road ended abruptly, crumbling into a dirt road. It sloped down toward a russet adobe house, wooden struts and tiles, a prayer flag fluttering in the cool breeze. Goats were picnicking all over the place, like a team of gardeners trimming the vegetation. This was Dandagaon, literally “the village on the hill.”
At first sight Dandagaon, a village of the simplest traditional stone and wood houses and a resort and some restaurants, looks like a movie set for an archetypal Nepali village, complete with a forest a stone’s throw away, hills all around, and behind them a panorama of lofty Himalayan peaks; corn fields, narrow steep trails, people milking cows, a cowherd. It’s like arriving (and the feeling is heightened by the proximity to the city) in a rustic utopia. And the loveliness of the place was deeper because of the sweeping view on one side of Kathmandu’s sea of concrete. It’s a place where the pang of loss comes easily, and is easily forgotten.

The village itself will be forgotten if you take the dirt road going north, a rougher continuation of the paved road. Just around the first bend from there you can catch, on clear days, a glimpse of the mountains you see on old photos of Kathmandu. But there is enough beauty to hold your attention even when the mountains are hidden.
The dirt road winds through dense forest, a dank and shadowy world where the only other color is green. Walking on this road is an instant connection with the wilderness, an immersion in forgotten sounds, a gorging on succulent silence and melodious bird songs. You begin to wonder what it must have been like when Kathmandu was a green valley of sparkling rivers and copses ringing with birdsong.
And you chide yourself and the time you are living in for having exchanged Nature for paved roads, for having distanced yourself from environments that bring you closer to your inner self.


The journey to Dandagaon is enjoyable no matter what the mode of transportation. There are plenty of routes to get there. If you are on a car or motorbike, the best option is the road that goes west from the Budhanilkantha Temple. From where you turn to go to the temple when coming from the Narayan Gopal Chok, go straight (west). About four meters down this road you will come to a small iron bridge, with a signboard identifying the river as Bishnumati. Turn right after crossing the bridge. Ask locals when you come to an intersection, but you will be climbing all the way to Dandagaon, so don’t take a turn that goes downhill.

If you are on a mountain bike or if you prefer to hike, a better route begins from the old Newar town of Tokha, which is 4 km north from Samakhushi Chok on the Ring Road (this is the same junction from which you go to Grande Hospital). Local buses depart from here for Tokha every 15 minutes or so. At the northern end of Tokha turn right on to the dirt road.
This will culminate at the base of a hill, with a small compound with a couple of simple temples. This is the Chandeshwori Temple. Take the dirt road going up from the northeastern corner of this temple. This dirt road is a wonderful route for mountain bikers. It will test you, though, for it’s a relentless climb. The trail will ultimately merge with the paved road from Budhanilkantha.

Tokha
Although concrete houses have replaced the majority of old Newar style houses here, the little town still has some of the charms of an agrarian community. Wander its alleys, some of which will be filled with the smell of chaku (molasses), a specialty of the town.
Chandeshwori
Its location in a little known corner of the Kathmandu Valley and proximity to a forest gives this temple complex a primeval look. If you are going to Dandagaon via Tokha, it’s well worth investing a couple of minutes walking around this compound of stone sculptures and fearsome Kali statue.
Baudeshwor Mahadev
If you have come as far as Tokha (and if it’s in the monsoon) there is a lovely waterfall and quaint shrine another 4 km down the road from there. This is the Baudeshwor Mahadev shrine. To get there, turn left at the northern end of Tokha, keeping on the paved road. The waterfall is at its biggest and most picturesque in the rainy season.

You will be passing through a national park. There are some sharp bends on the road, making honking almost a necessity. But don’t indulge on the horn like you are on a street in Kathmandu. Besides reducing noise pollution, there is also a selfish motive here: the quieter you are the better chances of seeing wildlife and birds. You will be passing through a dense forest, so it is best to travel in groups. Avoid taking shortcuts or venturing too far away from the main road or trails.

The most luxurious place to stay in Dandagaon is the Green Valley Resort. There are a couple of cheaper places scattered around the village. These are also the places to get snacks and meals. You might also be able to get some of the locals to cook a simple meal for you for a small fee. For aficionados of local drinks, there is always a steady supply of homemade wine in the village.

Climate change: Women from Rasuwa find themselves at the receiving end,"Thursday, August 18, 2016","After the recent earthquake, Samjhana Tamang of Golijung, Rasuwa, had to work hard to rebuild her house. Busy rebuilding their own homes before an impending monsoon, very few villagers offered to help her. In the absence of her husband, who is working in Malaysia, Tamang sought help from her brother, who lived nearby. Even then, she worked herself to transport construction materials to her dilapidated house.
Even before the earthquake, Tamang’s life was that of rising up to the hardships of rural living in Nepal. Tamang, who is educated till the twelfth standard, has a daughter, who studies in Kathmandu in grade 12. At home, she manages everything on her own. She looks after her children, is in charge of family farms, and mobilises the money that her husband sends. She is also a member of a women’s group in the village where members save Rs 100 every month and run micro-financial activities.


Over the next decades, billions of people, particularly those in developing countries, are expected to face shortages of water and food and risks to health and life as a result of climate change (UNFCCC, 2007). Women in developing countries, like Samjhana Tamang, are more vulnerable to climate change because they are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihood activities. All over the South Asian region, there have been evidences indicating increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme natural events such as flash floods, inundation, heat waves, intense rainfall and avalanches.
Although policy interventions have been made to address gender issues in the context of climate change, gender inequalities and caste‐based discrimination still prevail. Factors like geological variations, caste, discrimination and social barriers still make women more vulnerable to climate change-related hazards.
***
Goljung is a village located at an altitude of 1841 metres above the sea level. The village was in a rebuilding spree after the devastating earthquake when we visited.
There was a discernible distinction between women belonging to older and younger generations in Golijung. Unlike Samjhana Tamang, almost all of the older women we talked to were unable to respond in Nepali and spoke their native language.  Even then, almost all the women were tied to their community unlike men.


The village consists of a homogenous community — the Ghales and Tamangs account for almost 80 per cent of the population. The younger women, however, are proficient in Nepali, and unlike, the older generation, were dressed in jeans and t-shirts as opposed to traditional garb and ornaments.
The women in the village, especially the younger generation, are educated and have good access to information. However, women in Golijung lack exclusive decision-making rights, have very limited exposure to opportunities, and are still bound by traditional patriarchal systems.
While Samjhana’s education and experience have certainly helped her through her life, and the lifeskills she has honed can prove crucial during climactic as well as non-climatic emergencies, even the relative success story like Samjhana’s may be subject to other factors. Samjhana went to Kathmandu recently for a medical check-up and was diagnosed with bone tuberculosis.
Now, she waits for her husband to return home.
In the absence of her husband, Samjhana, on the other hand, has learnt to manage her life and that of her two children. She has faced more challenges, no doubt, but she has also had more opportunities to be part of the decision-making processes at the household and community levels.


But overall, men still dominate decision-making processes at both the household as well as community levels.
In the light of their continued dependence on natural resources for livelihood and little diversification in terms of other income sources women were found more vulnerable to the impact of climate change in the region. Moreover, while the men might migrate temporarily to find job opportunities elsewhere, the women need to be stationed in the village. They are bound to their families and homes as well as the community.
When compared to men, women in Golijung didn’t have exclusive rights to land ownership and have less influence on both the household and community levels in the decision making process.
Morevoer, women in the village have very little diversification in terms of income sources although they are  involved in income-generating activities like sewing and knitting. These activities are often carried out at an individual level; the things most women  produce are enough only for themselves and their families. A few pieces are sold to other people within the community. Never are the women seen working in a commercial setting; their market is limited to Syafrubesi.
As there is no diversification, if more of the local women get involved in sewing and knitting, there will soon be shortages of wool and thread in market. The women of the area do not have the skills to cope with such a scenario. While the men might migrate temporarily to find job opportunities elsewhere, the women need to be stationed in the village.
Not only are the women bound to their families and homes but to their community as well.

"At Pharping, among myths and miracles","Monday, August 15, 2016","Going to Pharping from Kathmandu feels like going back in time, from the city’s sorry present to its rich past. The transformation of the city into the countryside begins somewhere after Tribhuvan University. An old iron bridge, soot-black, spans a weary river of the same color.
Going past this bridge I feel like I’ve escaped the clutches of the city. A huge standing Buddha statue appears around the next bend on the road, the face childish. The escape is complete when the road loops into a pine forest.
When the mottled stretch of the road through the pine forest ends, you arrive in the Nepali film industry’s favorite filming destination. It’s easy to understand why. It’s an outdoors location mere kilometers from Kathmandu. For a tiny budget filmmakers have in their frame secluded hilltops and a desolate stone quarry pit—places they can easily present as some remote corner of Nepal.
It’s a place to linger if you are out on a weekend trip. There is the Chobar gorge (an old shaky bridge spanning it) and the somewhat conciliatory sight of the Bagmati flowing with some vigor, although yet not strong enough to shake off Kathmandu’s cargo of filth. You can crawl into caves or pass through the doors of the Jal Binayak Temple here.


But travel beyond Chobar and you are deeper into the countryside. The parts of the Kathmandu Valley that are visible from here have more green than concrete. Then you arrive at Taudaha, the lake frequented by migratory birds and lovebirds. Across it, terraced fields tumble down to the Bagmati.
The houses are of adobe, golden garlands of corn ears strung from eaves to eaves. Higher up, near the summit of a hill a monastery nestles, conspicuous because of its prayer flags. Eagles wheel overhead, scanning the hills that are so densely forested that it appears they are covered not in trees but by one great swath of green carpet.
The last third of the road to Pharping is like a metaphorical road to spirituality—as propounded in Tibetan Buddhism, to be precise. Monasteries with yellow roofs and whitewashed facades appear frequently beside the road. The biggest of them appears first, at a place called Bhanjhyang (a pass in the hills), effectively making the pass a gateway to a region caught in a monastery building boom. There is a reason for this abundance of monasteries and temples.
Pharping is mentioned in numerous religious texts as a highly sacred region, one that even great spiritual masters traveled to from as far as Tibet in ancient times. Even Padmashambhava, or Guru Rinpoche, the doyen of Tibetan Buddhism, is said to have stayed here and meditated.


The Sheshnarayan Temple complex is a site where mythology is etched on the cliffs, literally. This is one of four major Narayan (Vishnu) temples of the Kathmandu Valley. The temple’s major attraction is a knobby bunch of stalactites that people worship as the udder of a cow.
Old timers recall their grandparents telling them of a time when milk dripped from these teats. Just above the udder is a serpentine formation, hood flared like the classic seven-headed sheshnag of Hindu mythology. The temple is named after this formation.
More eye-catching than the stalactites is a crystal clear pond. Colorful fish swim languidly in this spring, gobbling up food that visitors feed them. At the bottom of this pond are several slender wooden poles covered in moss. They are the result of an annual ritual that the local community performs to commemorate an event from mythology.
According to folklore, when the priest of Sheshnarayan Temple became too old to walk downhill to the Bagmati River to fetch water for the daily puja, he prayed for help. A spring appeared and there was water, but the volume of water gushing out was so large that there soon flowed a swift river between the priest’s house and the temple. A pair of nags (snakes) stretched themselves across this river to form a bridge for the priest. In remembrance of the two nags locals select a tree with two boughs forking from the trunk, a symbolic union of two snakes, and throw it into the pond.


Equally sacred is the Rigzin Drubte Ghatshal, Pharping’s oldest monastery. The building itself is something of a recluse, tucked back under the cliff, away from the sun’s brightness, behind a screen of trees. It’s small and simply colored. But when you climb the small stairs from the pond to the monastery, it becomes clear that it’s not about appearances but something deeper. Perhaps this seclusion was what made Padmasambhava stay here and meditate in a small cave. The cave (so the local legend goes) is still there. A small circular cavity in the roof of this tiny cave is believed to be the imprint of Guru Rinpoche’s head.
Pharping Bazar is a curve and a climb on the road from the Sheshnarayan Temple. The place has the look of a village’s half-hearted attempt at urbanization, as though it felt obliged to keep up with transformation happening down in the Kathmandu Valley. The concrete houses are like a screen for old Newar style exposed brick houses, with cows in stables and hay stacks in the courtyard.
Arriving at Pharping Bazar is an abrupt change, and seeing shops and mannequins and cyber cafes you wonder if you have exhausted the ancient shrines and quaint places. But the road forks at Pharping Bazar.
Both roads go to a place of worship; the one going south takes you to Dakshinkali and the north road passes by the Ngagyur-Nyingmapa Rigzin Phodrang Monastery. And once again you find yourself at the entrance to a place that is sacred and ancient, with a story or two attached to it.


There are frequent buses from the Old Bus Park for Pharping. The ride costs 30 rupees. If you are on a private vehicle, cross the Ring Road at Balkhu toward Tribhuvan University. Continue straight down this road, past the university’s entrance gate. Pharping Bazar is almost 19 km from the Old Bus Park.

Sacred Stops
The sites here are given in the order in which they appear on the road to Pharping. While in these places, please remember to maintain silence and behave in a way appropriate to places of worship and retreat.
Seti Devi Temple
 This small shrine is easily missed because it is behind the gigantic monastery at Bhanjhyang. (Bhanjhyang is 16 km from the Old Bus Park). To get here, take the graveled road that skirts the monastery’s western wall. This road is only wide enough for two-wheelers; leave your four-wheelers at the Bhanjhyang market. After 400 meters you will arrive at the base of a flight of stone stairs. These lead to the temple. The temple’s sacredness is not its only attraction. There are sweeping views of Kathmandu and Pharping from here.
Roofless Temple
 Near the northern entrance (the flagstone trail between the lower fish pond) is a small doorway that leads into an abandoned-looking courtyard. In the middle of this courtyard is a humble temple, ordinary save for the fact that it has no roof. That is not because of the earthquake or any other natural calamity; the temple was designed that way. According to local lore, the idol housed there was brought over from India. The god, yearning for his homeland, is believed to make nightly trips to India. So the temple was made without a roof to ease the god’s departure and return.
Ganesh-Saraswati Temple
 Climbing up the flight of steep steps to the Rigzin Phodrang Monastery, you will see a small room opposite a prayer hall. This is the Ganesh-Saraswati Temple. There are small images of Ganesh and Saraswati embossed on the rock here, both of which are said to have materialized from the rock face on their own. Buddhists also come here to worship the Saraswati image, although to them it is the goddess Green Tara.
Asura Cave and Old Dakshinkali Temple
 There is another cave in Pharping where Padmashambhava is said to have meditated. The cave is Asura Cave. The cave is situated in the premises of the Ngagyur-Nyingmapa Rigzin Phodrang Monastery. The monastery is a couple of hundred meters down the road that forks right (west) from Pharping Bazar. A climb to the summit of the hill with the monastery and cave will bring you to the original site of the Dakshinkali shrine. It was from here that the shrine was moved to its current location.
Hydropower Station
 It will send a minor shock through your system to know that this hydropower station first produced electricity in 1911. This is a museum of sorts, with its hulking machinery parts, embossed with dates from the past century. There are one or two electric pylons here that date back to the year of this station’s completion. It’s worth a try to ask the staff working there to let you into the cavernous turbine room. If you’re lucky, they might decide to turn on the turbines for you, which is akin to watching a Megatron come to life. While you are there, check out the park built to commemorate the station’s centenary and the old reservoir.
Bottle House
 At first sight the Environment-Friendly Bottle House looks like an alcohol connoisseur’s handiwork. The walls are covered in whiskey and beer bottles—all empty. Some 5000 empty bottles have been used to build two houses that serve as a farmers’ school and community meeting hall. To get there, take the south road from Pharping Bazar.
Head 400 meters on this road. There, on the left, you will see a board pointing down a steep trail. It’s best not to take your motorbike down this trail in the monsoon. This unique building is the work of Shikharapur Community Learning Centre. They hold recreational events like rice-planting and other farming-related activities. The farm also takes volunteers. To learn more, visit asc.org.np, shikharapurclc.edu.np, and Asc Pharping (Facebook).

Family Guest House is a good option if you want to stay close to the town’s center. Options farther away from the crowded part of town include Hotel Ashoka and Dakchhinkali Village Inn.

The road west from Pharping Bazar is lined with restaurants. Sikkim Restaurant is highly recommended for its delicious momos, vegetable thukpa, fried potatoes and the prohibitively fiery tomato chutni. Opposite this eatery is The Himalayan Restaurant, whose rooftop thatch-roof huts are the best location to take in the bucolic sights from while munching on snacks.

"Music, song and dance along the Rapti in Sauraha","Thursday, August 11, 2016","Sauraha, in southern Nepal, is best known for its elephant rides and jungle safaris. But the region’s music, which emanates from nature herself, should give you one more reason to visit Sauraha soon.
In Sauraha, music comes from different sources, some expected, some not so much.


Imagine sitting on a boat on the Rapti, the main river flowing through the vast expanse of forest in Sauraha. The river has its own music.
During winter, its music is that of contemplation and calm. Silence is the best tune on the river’s playlist.
However, during the monsoon, the river changes its tunes. After heavy rain, you can hear the water gush through the sandy banks, splashing against the rocks.



The boatmen in Sauraha may not be master singers, but they have their own stories to tell. Their stories would make for beautiful lyrics for any song.  The stories are of their love of the water, their attachment with the river, and the the times the river made them sad.



As you ride the boat along the Rapti, you hear birds of different hue, sing to nature’s tunes. You may not understand their language but it is readily apparent that they sing of the happiness of being in their abode and the freedom to move around the lush green.



When dusk comes, you hear nocturnal creatures take up from where the birds left. They sing a chorus like no other.



The Tharus, the sons and daughters of the soil, also sing and dance to songs of nature, love and life. You feel that they are one with nature, and their songs are written by none other than mother nature, herself.

"Kakani: Just outside Kathmandu, this village comes to life at night","Monday, August 8, 2016","An entire hillside carved on terraces lay before me. On every terrace, painted in a green slightly darker than the hill, was an iron bench. There was a bench a couple of feet from me, there was a bench way down the slope, near where the hill merged with a copse.
What was this, a place to come to sit and stare at the chain of hills? I didn’t know whether the scene was morose or serene, a depiction of desertion or an invitation to do nothing but simply sit on a bench and look at nature, at hills scarred by man, and mull on the follies of mankind.
Actually this was the picnic spot in Kakani, the small village a couple of kilometers off the Pasang Lhamu Highway that links Kathmandu to Rasuwa.
I had heard about it for a while before finally going there, so I had come to Kakani expecting a secluded place that, because of Kathmandu’s febrile pace of life, would give the sense of a faraway place.

I wasn’t disappointed. The sense of going to a place that is slower and quieter and devoid of distractions is felt almost after you leave the highway and turn onto a steep paved road. The road begins to wind slowly, mist drifting in to dramatize the arrival at the village. Then a minor anti-climax: a police check post. The Law is the last thing you want to pip you to a place you liked because it had few people. After providing your vehicle and driver’s license numbers, you continue onward, going past quarters with uniforms hung up to dry.

Kakani is not a place that gets you wide-eyed or smiley as soon as you arrive. In fact, it’s quite a disappointment at first sight. A couple of shops line a narrow road that descends to a muddy football field (the local school’s playground), and you find yourself at a dead end. Kakani kata ho, didi? you want to ask, but you don’t because that would be embarrassing. So you rephrase the question: What are the popular sights around here? That was how I was shown to the picnic spot. So ordering dal-bhaat I went to check out the picnic spot and found a hillside with its crop of iron benches.
The picnic spot is a good place for seekers of solitude (and couples on a date), but I was not interested in seeing a vista that was lovely but not much different from scenes that you see from hilltops in Nepal’s hilly region. And looking carefully I could see Kathmandu’s concrete sprouts between two hill slopes. I wanted to see more of Kakani—if there was more.
The owner of the hotel I ate my lunch in suggested I go down the trail across the school playground. I crossed over the soft soggy field, lingering for a while to examine a dead snake. After a while I arrived at a gate that was long bamboo poles fitted horizontally into slits. This was the Nepal Scouts International Training Center. It looked like a resort or a retreat center.

The training center had nice clean rooms, a washing machine (in a village!), and a kitchen with a floor so clean you could have eaten off it. I asked the cook if there were wild animals around. He pointed to the terrace fifty meters from the ground floor rooms. “In winter that is where a leopard sometimes comes to bask in the sun,” he said.
The training center only got better as I walked around. It was a huge property, with a quaint cottage here, a training hall hidden behind a knoll there, and a trail that led to the edge of a dark forest.
I peeped into the cottage atop the knoll, where the center’s manager lived, and saw that it was furnished like the country house of an aristocrat. But the forest enchanted me more. The trail leading into it was overgrown with grass, and spider webs spanned across it.
An abandoned building, walls and roof missing, stood like a relic. It had been a small Nepal Army post that had been abandoned during the civil war. Then the Maoists had bombed it. The building’s presence at the entrance of the dank forest gave the place a somber, almost sinister, feel.
Kakani was at its best in the nights. The hills on the north were dotted with tiny lights of houses. Overhead, stars filled the sky. Insects supplied the background music. I stood on a rooftop, surrounded by darkness, savoring my time in this quiet place. I had noticed a wooden pillar in the training center’s garden.
There were wooden arrows sticking out of it, names of cities – Johannesburg, Sydney, New York – and distances to them from Kakani painted on them. Then the mist had rolled in, obscuring the distance, and Kathmandu felt as far as those cities.



From the Balaju Chok at Ring Road continue north toward Baisdhara. You can take any of the buses plying the route to Nuwakot and Trisuli from the bus park at Machhapokhari. Buses leave for Kakani throughout the day, the first one departing around six in the morning. Get off at the small market just before the check post at Kaulithana. Turn right onto the steep paved road from there. Kakani is four kilometers from there. There is no public transportation from that market to Kakani.

Mountain Gazing
On clear days there is a stunning vista of mountains to Kakani’s north. In the chain of mountains are Manaslu (8,163m), Ganesh Himal (7,406m), Langtang Lirung (7,246m), Dorje Lakpa (6,975m), Shisha Pangma (8,012m) and Mt. Gauri Shankar (7,146m). Climb to the Shiva temple perched on a hillock near the entrance to the picnic spot to get an unobstructed view of these peaks.
Strawberry Binge
If you love strawberries, you will love Kakani. According to a 2010 UNDP report, this village produces 250, 000 kg of strawberry annually. Some of that produce goes into making wine and squash, both of which are available in many of the small shops and restaurants there.
Mushrooms
Another crop that Kakani produces in copious amount is mushrooms. Thatch-roofed tunnels appear along the last stretch of the road to Kakani. It’s a good place to buy mushrooms—fresher and cheaper than in Kathmandu.
Bounties of the Gardens
The rainy season is not the best time to go to Kakani, but it has its own charms. One of which is fruits. Most homes there have fruit trees in their gardens, so you will get to enjoy seasonal fruits.
Local Delicacies
Eateries in Kakani offer wonderful local cuisines like dhindo. Smoked meat is almost part of the décor in the restaurants. Try sukuti ko achar while there.
Treats En Route
There are culinary delights even before you get to Kakani. The most popular is fried trout. The fish are raised locally, either in trout farms or by the restaurants themselves.

Kakani Mountain View Hotel, Tara Gaon Resort Hotel, and View Himalaya Resort are the high-end hotels in Kakani. Nepal Scouts International Training Center is a good choice if you prefer seclusion.
For an experience of village life, go for the homely lodges near the village center.

Mosquitoes and tourists: Himalayan village grapples with climate change,"Tuesday, August 2, 2016","“Mosquitos and tourists!” Chokdup Lachenpa shouts at no one in particular as he takes a long sip of Tongba (hot beer) from his bamboo mug.  As if on cue, the children chorus, “The first is because of climate change and the second is the cause of climate change,” causing much mirth and laughter among the customers.
We are sitting at Chokdup’s daughter’s tiny teashop-cum-bar in Lachen, a small village perched 2,750 metres above the mean sea level (MSL) on the right bank of the Lachen Chu river in North Sikkim. Outside, in the foggy twilight, across the Himalayas, we can see the headlights of a cavalcade of vans and jeeps that will soon bring hundreds of tourists to Lachen for a night’s halt.
Situated on a grassy mountain slope, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and forests of rhododendrons and conifers, Lachen is so beautiful it has been declared a “heritage village” by the Sikkim government. And that is its problem. The tag is accompanied by “eco-tourism homestays” pushed strongly by bureaucrats.
It is the last stop for tourists going to Gurudongmar Lake, 5,430 metres above sea level. Buddhists and Sikhs consider the lake sacred. Now, tourists from Maharashtra and Gujarat seem to be competing with the peripatetic Bengalis to make Lachen the number one tourist attraction in North Sikkim.
Feeling the heat
What most of the tourists won’t know is that Lachen valley is facing a massive climate crisis. Behind those welcoming smiles, the Lachenpas – the local residents, an indigenous tribe of the Bhutia community – are a worried lot. Reduced snowfall, unseasonal rains and the forest fires of last summer have made them all very anxious.
To make matters worse and potentially dangerous, Lachen is in the path of the streams flowing down from the growing Lake Shako Cho. The lake at the snout of the glacier by the same name is growing because the glacier is melting faster. It is identified to be at high risk of causing a glacial lake outburst flood, a type of flood that occurs when the gravel holding in such a lake collapses.

According to an independent risk assessment modelling by a group of scientists led by R. Worni, “The natural gravel embankment holding the Shako Cho Lake inside could burst at any time, releasing a tidal wave of water. Thangu, a village of about 100 homes immediately below the lake, would be obliterated. The ensuing flood could also demolish houses here in Lachen, 11 miles farther downstream, especially those near to the unstable bluffs of the lake-fed river that runs just east of the village.”
Climate change and glaciers
Climate change is already decimating mountain glaciers almost everywhere on earth at the rate of 3% every year. In India, Himalayan glaciers have lost about 10% of their volume in the past four decades. The Jemu Glacier, not very far from Lachen, has retreated by around 20 metres per year during 1975-90, scientist Jagadish Bahadur wrote in his book titled Himalayan Snow and Glaciers – Associated Environmental Problems, Progress and Prospects.
Even Gurudongmar Lake, the local attraction, has shrunk considerably, according to the residents, raising a question about the sustainability of the tourism industry. The rich biodiversity is also at risk.
“Lachen was the first village to ban plastic water bottles in India. We have always practised organic farming, we have no industry that emits carbon dioxide, we have no emissions, we own very little, nothing compared to the people from the cities,” Hishey Lachenpa states as she serves me another glass of hot tea.

Tourists arrive in a babble of Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali demanding tea, hot bath water, soda, room heaters and food.
Hishey is 18 years old and studies in class 12 in a public school near Gangtok. She is back home during the summer vacation to help her mother, who has converted a tiny 12 x 12 feet toehold into her home, grocery store, teashop and bar. Hishey’s father is a monk and rarely visits them. She sleeps here with her mother, sister and an adopted younger brother.
“This year we had very little snowfall. Normally we have snowfall from December to February. This year we had snow only in December and then a little in January. But the rains seem to have come early. It will surely affect the potato farmers in Thangu.” Hishey, who has studied climate change at school, says with some authority.
A flash of lightning heralds the long threatened storm. Two men walk into the teashop with the news that a landslide has blocked the road to Gurudongmar lake and the Indian Army can do nothing about it until the next day. So there is no need to wake up and leave at 3 the next morning. They buy two nips of rum, borrow two glasses and disappear quickly.
Gatuk Lachenpa’s house is the oldest in town, a simple two-storeyed stone, earth and lime structure that withstood the September 18, 2011 earthquake. But almost 70% of such old houses in Lachen have now been torn down to make way for gaudily painted, hurriedly built, brick and cement tower blocks, which look most fragile and unsafe, but will help maximise the benefits of tourism.
“Traditionally, Lachenpas used to cultivate barley, maize and buck wheat for their staple and potatoes, turnips, radishes, cauliflowers for their vegetables. But due to erratic weather and fear of water scarcity in the future, most of them are increasingly abandoning their farms to profit from the booming tourism business,” says Gatuk, a farmer who has just built a 50-room hotel, right next to his ancestral home in the middle of the village.
Minimising negative impacts
“Peak tourist seasons are March through May and September through November.  Seventy percent of tourists passing through Lachen are Indians. They typically stay 1–2 nights in Lachen before heading off to Gurudongmar Lake. It is good business. We have to make the most of it till it lasts. While maximising the benefits of tourism, we have to minimize its negative impacts.”  Gatuk says.

Measures like banning plastic drinking water bottles and segregated garbage management and replanting of trees are seen as steps towards minimising the negative impacts of tourism. But Lachenpas do not know how to cope with climate change impacts and least of all about what to do if the lake overhead bursts its banks.
Sikkim’s chief minister Pawan Chamling had once famously said, “Sikkim is a mini-theatre which in a way displays how climate change triggered by non-natural forces at the global level could bring disastrous natural calamities.”
Lachen clearly is the main stage where all the catastrophic scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are being played out every day.
“The biggest worry is water scarcity. We used to get about 10 feet of snow but last few years we have only received 2 feet. The barren patches on the Angden Lama peak where our water comes from is a constant reminder of how climate change will change everything for us in the near future.” says Palzar Lachenpa, the current Pipon of Lachen, the traditionally elected head of the local government, the Dzumsa.
“We have only just recovered from the devastation caused by the 6.9 magnitude earthquake of September 2011. All the houses have been rebuilt. Many have added extra rooms to accommodate more tourists. We will never be able to recover from another disaster. We know we are sitting right under its nose, but what can we do?” Gatuk says worriedly about Shako Cho Lake.
Climate calamity
Off seasonal rainfall, unusually stormy weather, landslides, receding glaciers, short winters, accelerated snowmelt, longer summers, fears of water scarcity, failed crops, mosquitoes, crows, tourism pressures and the clear and present threat of a lake that can burst its banks – Lachen is in grip of a climate calamity but this finds no mention in the Sikkim’s State Action Plan on Climate Change.
“We are doing more than our fair share to reduce carbon emissions but we need more information on adaptation to climate change, we have very little understanding of what is happening. Everything is unpredictable now — rain, snow, summer, winter, everything. We need precise weather information, we need early warnings systems and we need better predictions. More information, any information, to help me and the Dzumsa to better prepare our people for what is to come,” says the Pipon.

"Snow, sunshine, smiles, rains and reflections in Sindhuplachowk’s Panch Pokhari","Wednesday, July 27, 2016","It was the first time I’d encountered snow. It was slippery, we walked carefully. But everyone was happy.
I drew a smiley on the snow and wrote ‘Happy Birthday’.
Sixteen hours later, I could hardly ask, “Are you awake?” through the thin nylon sheet of our tent that we set up inside a shelter (read ‘shed’).
There was another tent in the shed. It was for the men in our group.
The dying embers of fire dimly lit up our shelter. “I’m scared,” a barely audible voice came from the other tent.
“This was not how I’d planned to spend my birthday.”
That night, everyone was awake, but it felt like ages since somebody last spoke.
“Are you cold?” I asked.
“Yes.”
“I can’t believe I’m cold through the stone walls and the tent and the sleeping bag and three layers of clothing!”
I wished I could chuckle at the irony, it was the month of April and one thing we weren’t prepared for was snow.
We were at Panchpokhari, (translates to five lakes in Nepali). At 4,100m high in Sindhupalchowk, the area has high-altitude wetlands that boast an undisturbed, pristine ecosystem unlike many tourist destinations in Nepal.
On a clear day, Panchpokhari offers an incredible view of the Himalayas. Langtang range, Jugal and Rolwaling, you name it, you see it!
The place is also famous locally for the fair that is held during Janaipurnima, in August-September. There are different routes to reach the lakes — some of them demand at least a couple weeks. We took a shorter route, yet more challenging one that begins at Bhotang, an area inhabited by Tamangs.
And little did we know it would make all the difference!
We climbed uphill the same day. After negotiating the steep slope, that too through a drizzle, we reached our shelter for the day. It was bhanjyang (a pass of some sort) where we set up our tents, ate our half-cooked dinner and crept inside our warm colourful nests.
The view of sunrise next morning was one of the most beautiful things I’d ever seen in my life. It was like an illusion as if someone had piled gold on the mountain.
More breath-taking views awaited us the second day. The highlight of the day was a hill full of rhododendrons, you name the colour: red, pink, white, purple; it was all there. The hilltop looked like a colourful fuzzy carpet.
And there was rain again!
We wanted to reach Panchpokhari the same day, but it proved to be a bit over-ambitious plan. The downpour was so bad, it didn’t seem possible.
An old man we met on the way (correction: the only man we met on our way) assured us that there’s a hotel a little ahead. The cold was so bad we walked fast to reach our imaginary safe haven.
Two hours later, we found out that that old man had a seasonal hut near Nassyam-Pati. And that was the ‘hotel’ he was talking about!
We chose to spend our night in our tents, however, it was nice to have an indoor fire, some good tea and a properly cooked meal.
At 7 am the next morning, we left Nassyam-Pati.
Some of the porters had went off in search of ‘kira’ (yarsagumba aka the Himalayan Viagra), so our team had to split.
The morning looked like there were mountains in our courtyards, hills on the porch and clouds on our footsteps. An hour of walk later, we saw that the ground was reflecting bright white light. Despite the snowy delight, I was a little scared because we didn’t have snow-shoes and the path was slippery, steep.
All this was fun until we hit a rock. Quite literally, that.
We were treading a very narrow path that cut through the edges of a steep hill. A member of our team stepped on a stone, the stone toppled and she toppled along.
The merriment, cheerfulness, sense of adventure, and everything else that came with it went off with the stone.
I don’t remember how much time passed we stood there frozen, clueless.
A voice came from below, something barely audible, “…..stuck…..stem….tree….”
It was a relief at first, but we had a huge problem, the ropes were with other members of the team we’d left behind. Only three of us were there, and it was up to us to save her. Twenty minutes, tens of sticks and some cut pieces of ropes later, she was with us, shivering, cold and scared.
Quiet.
It got worse.
We still had more than half the way to hike and the slopes were getting steeper and narrower. The snow was a couple of feet deep, the sun was nowhere to be seen.
It looked dark although it was before noon. Visibility was pretty low, thanks to the fog.
The scene looked like a still from a psychological thriller, dark, depressing, and silent.
A bird soared in the sky, hardly visible. It was the first living soul we’d seen apart from old ‘hotelier’.
We reached Panchpokhari just before two. We had a purpose, to finish our research on time and return early before the weather got worse.
The evening was quite melancholic, thousands of times worse than the monsoon blues back home. I missed home.
We spent the night weighing our options. It rained and snowed all night. We speculated on the worst-case scenarios and calculated how long our food and fuel would last. And since there was no mobile phone network coverage, how’d anyone find us if we were stranded.
All kinds of crazy ideas were spoken of, debunked and talked about again.
The morning, however, brought sunshine. As the sky cleared up, the snow-covered landforms glistened in front of us like little mountains whose reflections smiled back at them from the lakes.
The beautiful shades of blue replaced the shades we were carrying in our hearts. The snow didn’t seem hostile, the air was free of dampness and the photons carried with them a positive vibe that spread out like it was infectious.
Everything was perfect again.
By the time we finished our work, half the snow had melted away.
The bird showed up again as we prepared to leave.
“Until next time,” it seemed to say.

Finding nature’s long-lost music and motion in Kathmandu’s monsoon,"Friday, July 22, 2016","Of all the sounds of Nature that have been lost in Kathmandu, the one of flowing water is the one sorely missed.
The city’s rivers are portraits of tragedy. Some of us might remember the days when the rivers of Kathmandu could be heard. Others have been to places where water flows freely or rages on or plunges spectacularly. But there is a growing segment of the city’s populace that might never have had the pleasure of seeing swift flowing rivers or roaring waterfalls.
Fortunately, that aspect of Nature’s music and motion awaits them within the Valley.
Waterfalls are an enthralling show of water’s expression of its freedom. “There is enchantment in flowing water: I [am] hypnotised by its beauty,” the novelist and poet Vikram Seth once wrote, moved by the sight of several waterfalls near a village on the Nepal-Tibet border.
Kathmanduites are lucky to have two such sites of enchantment within the Valley. One is at Sundarijal. It comes into view at the end of one of the first taxing climbs up from the village. The location is perfect. Your calves are aching, back drenched in sweat, the sun beating down relentlessly when a sudden coolness kisses your face—the mist from the waterfall. The roar comes next, followed by the first sight of the waterfall.
It’s a milky torrent, cascading down a rock face smothered by vines. The refreshing spray entices you to go closer; the deafening roar makes you hesitate. Sundarijal, Beautiful Water, seems an apt name for a place where water flaunts its beauty.
Shyalmati Jharna, as the locals call it, is a border of sorts. If you walk past it, you enter the wilderness that is the Shivapuri National Park. Visitors, presumably ones in their teens, have given it another name: Sweet Sixteen Waterfall. Getting a light coat of mist, you can sit and watch the Bagmati spurt forth from between massive boulders. Coming from the city where bodies of water have long been defeated and shackled into stagnation, this sight of water running wild and free is a welcome sight.
The other waterfall within the Valley is a gift of the monsoons. A small plume of water in the dry season, the waterfall near the Baundeshwor Mahadev shrine turns into a majestic pillar of white water in the rainy season. Getting there, too, is a passage through one of the monsoon season’s most refreshing sights: green seas of rice fields.
Baundeshwor, or Jhor Mahankal as it is also known, is located north of the ancient Newar town of Tokha. It’s a lovely drive on a paved road (potholed in places) through a verdant countryside. The waterfall tumbles down from a forested hill. Beside it is a small shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva. Hundreds of people visit the shrine on Saturdays and Mondays. But people also go there simply to be in the refreshing vicinity of the waterfall. In the monsoon there are mini waterfalls all around the Baundeshwor waterfall, offering personal discoveries for those willing to risk slimy trails and leeches.
A trip to any of these waterfalls is a chance to be in the midst of all that has been banished from our city—greenery, tranquility, fields and forests. And the almost-forgotten verses of the poem that is a waterfall, that “sounding cataract falling whitely into chaos, that informs the purity of a uniform element with the varying impulse of life.”



Shyalmati
Buses depart throughout the day from the Old Bus Park in Kathmandu for Sundarijal. The route is through Putalisadak, Gyaneshwor, Gaushala, Chabahil, Jorpati. Sundarijal is approximately 18km from the Old Bus Park.
Baundeshwor
There is a bus every 15 minutes (or so the bus company claims, but buses tend to wait longer if there are only a handful of passengers onboard) from Samakhusi Chok to Baundeshwor Chok. The fare is 35 rupees. If you plan on going and coming back on a public bus you must remember that the last bus down from Baundeshwor departs at 5:30 PM. Miss that bus and your only option will be hitchhiking.
To get to Baundeshwor you need to get to where the Tokha Road splits from the Ring Road. This junction is a little ways east of Samakhusi Chok. The landmark is a big Grande Hospital hoarding board. Head straight (north) on the Tokha Road. After 4 km you will arrive at Tokha, an old town sitting atop a knoll. Keep going north on the main road. The road forks at the northern end of Tokha; there, take the left, downhill road toward Jhor. Another 4 km on this road will get you to Baundeshwor Chok. If you’re on a private vehicle, keep going north for another 1.3 km to get to the parking spot. Since monsoon is the time to visit Baundeshwor , it’s best to walk up to the waterfall and shrine from the Baundeshwor Chok. It’s riskier coming down to the shrine from the parking spot, as the trail is slimy and steep.

Where there are waterfalls there is slippery ground. In the monsoons, this risk is increased by the appearance of moss and algae. It’s hard to resist getting close to waterfalls, but you need to be careful. Boulder-hopping in Sundarijal might seem like a good idea, but it’s best to enjoy the scene from a distance. The access to the waterfall at Baundeshwor is a narrow trail, most of which is taken up by people queuing up to do puja at the shrine. Do not try to take alternate routes that involve climbing up on wet rocks to get close to the waterfall. Inform the volunteers that you are there only for the waterfall and they will let you through.

The eateries in Sundarijal offer everything from dal bhaat to tidbits. There are fewer eateries in the vicinity of Baundeshwor, although there are occasional places selling snacks and some simple lodges calling themselves resorts on the way. Tokha has the most places to eat on the way to Baundeshwor.

Sundarijal is not only about leaping water. The first thing after climbing up from the Sundarijal market is a hydropower station, the second-oldest in Nepal. An intense climb from the Shyalmati waterfall will bring you to the Sundarijal Museum. The museum commemorates the life of B.P. Koirala, who was imprisoned in the same building during the Panchayat period. If you have time and wish to extend your stay in the tranquil environs, you can continue uphill to the Tamang village of Mulkharka.
If you are into traditional Newar architecture and localities, stop in Tokha en route to Baundeshwor. There are plenty of narrow alleys here to loiter in and make mini discoveries, one of which might be arriving at a shop making the town’s famous chaku (molasses). Turn right from the northern end of Tokha for Chandeshwori, an old shrine at the edge of a forest. Hidden in the forest some fifty meters from the Baundeshwor waterfall is another, smaller waterfall. Ask the volunteers at the Baundeshwor Mahadev shrine for directions.

Gosaikunda: The Lake Behind the Snowy Pass,"Tuesday, July 19, 2016","The view from the terrace of the lodge made the hours of uphill climb and walking through dank, eerie forests worthwhile.
Golden and pink light moved across massive mountains like a silk scarf, lingering for moments but always slipping away as the sinking sun tugged at it from the other end. The sky was awash with fiery red and deep orange. Far, far away, where our destination lay, a solitary peak shone, an upturned canine gilded by, last light. And just like that the show was over. The landscape became the colour of ink. Stars appeared.
This was in Chisapani, the customary first night’s halt on the trek to the holy lake of Gosainkunda, trekking from the Sundarijal side. After a spectacle like that it was hard not to believe that something magical, whether religious or secular, lay on the other side of the mountains. Whether one was a pilgrim or simply a city-sick trekker, Gosainkunda rang of salvation.
Chisapani was also where one of my favourite raconteurs lived, a grandmother who ran a tea-house. I had first known her when trekking through the village years ago. She sold homemade alcohol and snacks, most of them made from the smoked buffalo meat hanging from her kitchen’s rafters. Her teashop was a social hub: trekkers, goat herders, villagers passing through all stopped for a glass of millet wine. Sometimes, like on that evening I visited her, she was alone. The only sound was her cackling radio, the loquacious accompaniment to the silence of her loneliness (she lived alone in the wooden house, her husband choosing to live with his second, younger wife).
The hut was exactly as I remembered, down to the bamboo ashtray and adobe hearth and soot-blackened rafters. Aama, as I called her, was the same, all giggles and teller of tall tales. She regaled us that evening with her childhood memory of seeing the Tibetan refugees who had followed the Dalai Lama out of Tibet. Her father had taken her to Tundikhel to see the strange people. “They pulled out black hunks from their gowns and bit off pieces and chewed. It was only when my father told me that I realized the pieces were dried meat.” After a wonderful meal of fried meat (her specialty), we walked back to the village, looking at the sky teeming with stars, pointing to familiar constellations.
At the end of the next day, an easy hike, we arrived in Golfubhanjhyang. There we checked into the Thodong Lama Lodge. Besides being a spotlessly clean lodge, it doubled as a rehabilitation center for those who’d been ripped off on trekking routes. When I inquired about the price it was so reasonable that it remains the only place on a trekking route ever where I didn’t even think about bargaining.
Our room, The Parasol Room, named after one of the eight sacred Buddhist symbols, contained two small beds and a table. On the table between the beds was a small basket with two little pieces of chocolate—on the house. The chocolates were undoubtedly the idea of Roman, the Swiss operator of the lodge. And the low price was down partly to the fact that he did the work of five people—taking orders, bringing food and drinks, carrying buckets of water to the toilet and shower room. He was a human version of the Swiss Army knife.
From Golfubhanjhyang onward traffic on the trail thinned to a trickle. Occasionally there was a large trekking group coming down the hill, led by guides, with cooks and camp helpers lagging behind. That was to be expected; we were going on a trek into the mountains in winter. I asked trekkers coming down if there was snow on the pass before Gosainkunda. There was, they said, but not enough to cause concern.
On the fourth day of the trek we arrived at the foot a flight of stairs that went up to a small bluff with a tiny settlement of lodges. This was Ghopte. As I stepped on the stairs, a sweet song drifted to me. It was a bewitching voice. I got to the top of the stairs and saw that the singer was a girl in her teens. She stopped as soon as she saw me. I had gone barely a hundred meters beyond Ghopte when I froze on the trail. It was a male Impeyan pheasant. I tried to reach for my camera and it flew down the mountain like an iridescent arrow.
That pheasant was a compensation for the lack of color that came after Ghopte. Almost without warning we crossed the treeline and arrived in lichen country. The only eye-catching life here was in the form of scurrying balls of fur: marmots. These rodents came out from their burrows to bask in the sun amongst boulders the size of small houses. Overhead, eagles wheeled; smaller birds flitted about. The landscape became increasingly emptier, quieter and rockier. And we were higher. It felt like the mind was slowly being stripped of the trivialities that fill it at lower altitudes. Pilgrims and non-pilgrims alike were bound to feel something special was close.
Pilgrimages in the Himalayas are synonymous with tribulations, and that is part of their appeal. Our test came at the Surya Kunda Pass. The harmless (according to my informers) snow had melted, then frozen solid by the wind; the trail was an ice skating rink. Inching along, making detours to find rocks sticking out of the ice, we made it down to Gosainkunda in four hours—a distance that takes forty minutes when the trail is free of ice. We hardly noticed the stunning mountains that stood like sentinels on the horizon or the sacred lake at the bottom of an amphitheater on our way down.
The sacred lake became more than just a beautiful body of water for us. We were relieved and grateful for arriving on its shore without getting hurt. That and the beauty of the place brought a prayer of gratitude to our lips. Both a pilgrimage and a trek involve going through wonderful and trying places. But it is the corners of our inner landscape that they sometimes take us to that we remember longest.



The April 2015 earthquake badly damaged sections of the trekking trail from Sundarijal to Gosainkunda. As a result parts of this route are hazardous. It is best to avoid taking this route unless there is assurance from experienced trekking guide who has been on the trail after the quake. Trekking up from Dhunche, the district headquarters of Rasuwa, is the safer (and shorter) option.

National Park Permit and TIMS Card
Gosainkunda lies in Langtang National Park, so visitors need to pay an entry fee for the park. This can be done – and is recommended that it be done – at the Nepal Tourism Board office in Kathmandu. There have been cases of national park employees asking for double the entry fee at the national park’s entry points in Langtang. Officials in Kathmandu assure you that this overcharging is illegitimate, but it’s better to be on the safe side and pay the entry fee in Kathmandu. Non-Nepalis also need to have a Trekking Information Management System (TIMS) card in Kathmandu. It’s available at the Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN) office. Carry these cards and receipts with you until the end of your trek.

Nepal’s new int’l airport spurs hotel rush in Bhairahawa,"Friday, July 15, 2016","
The construction of an international airport in Bhairahawa in southern Nepal is bound to turn the tourism sector in the Lumbini area on its head.
At least four new five-star hotels are currently being constructed there, while several more are in the works. The lucrative opportunity to lay claim to a piece of the tourism market of the region, which mainly consists of pilgrims visiting the birthplace of Gautam Buddha, has sent tourism entrepreneurs from Nepal and elsewhere into a frenzy to operate hotels of all scales and sizes.
The number of tourists visiting the area is expected to rise sharply after the international airport comes into operation in 2018. The airport is seen by many entrepreneurs as the growth engine for tourism in the region.
There are approximately 1.5 billion Buddhists all over the world.
In Bhairahawa’s Balapur, Hotel Bodhi Red Sun is currently being upgraded to a five-star. Bodhi Red Sun has been one of the most sought-after hotels in the region. Once completed, the capacity of the hotel will increase to 106 rooms from the current 64 rooms.
A new wing is currently under construction at the old site. The construction is expected to be completed in spring next year.

Another five-star hotel currently under construction in the region is Hotel Pawan Palace. Unlike Hotel Bodhi Red Sun, Pawan Palace will be constructed from ground up and will house a total of 147 luxury rooms. The hotel is being built at a cost of Rs 1.35 billion, and is expected to come into operation in October, 2017.
The hotel is owned by entrepreneur Pawan Kumar Halwai, a popular name for his confectionery business in the area.
It is not only regional entrepreneurs like Halwai, who are investing in the hospitality sector of the region. Kathmandu-based hotels are also trying to grab market share in the lucrative tourism sector of the region.
Among those looking to further their presence in Lumbini are Crowne Plaza Kathmandu Soaltee, Hotel Shangri La, Hotel Tibet and Dwarika’s Hotel. Also looking to venture into the region are Chaudhary Group, Landmark Hotel and Resorts and Asian Pharmaceuticals.
While it remains to be seen how well the large amount of capital invested by entrepreneurs like CP Shrestha, who is building the five-star property Nansc Two in Belahiya, yields result, the boom in the tourism sector of the region is welcomed by many.
As of now, those who have invested in the region, like the Hong Kong-based Silver Heritage Group, which has backed another five-star property called Tiger Palace, are largely focused on completing the construction of their hotels in time before 2018.

Five reasons why Mardi could be the next Annapurna Base Camp,"Thursday, July 14, 2016","The newly-opened Mardi Himal Base Camp route is a good alternative to the touristy ABC trekking route nearby. The five-day trek to the Annapurnas will take you to the lap of the Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchre, Manaslu and Annapurna ranges.
Although the route may not be accessible to some because of its scarce logistics (which will vastly improve as the route gets more popular), the feel of charting relatively new territories will compensate for the luxury of amenities in the more popular Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) and Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek.
Here are five reasons to trek to the Annapaurnas via the Mardi Himal Base Camp (MHBC).


Any trek to the Himalayas will greet you with stunning vistas but in MHBC, you will get the chance to experience the mountains a little more intimately.
Bring your snow boots along because a major portion of the trek will have you treading snow in the Annapurna’s many mountains.



A symbiotic relationship between the people here and their surroundings still prevails, which is slowly dying in the more popular routes.


Because the route was only recently opened for tourists, a vast majority of the population still continues to live the same way as they have been doing for centuries. Compare this to the inhabitants of regions covered by organised trekking; you will readily see the humility and hospitality in Mardi’s faces.

The region is more yielding of crops and vegetables as compared to the Everest region. Food here are locally sourced and will always be fresh. Fresh as in just-picked-from-the-garden fresh.


In the vast expanse of white and blue, a feeling of desolation and awe both creep in at the same time. This gives way to an all-pervading calmness, which drowns everything with it.
In MHBC, this feeling is stronger because the mountains are closer.

Silhouettes and Silence in Nepal’s Begnas Lake,"Sunday, July 10, 2016","I woke up, walked out of my hotel and seemed to have entered right into a Zen painting.
Begnas’s inky waters stretched into the distance like a huge sheet of satin. On it and all around it, it was all silhouettes and silence.
The fluid sound of oars entering, caressing and leaving the water rose as fishermen moved to another spot. When they stopped, silence gushed in. Then another sound as a fishing net landed on the water. The fishermen pulled in the net deftly, determined not to let fish or sound escape.
Equally deftly an invisible hand was pulling the cloak of darkness away from the land. The hills in the east were beginning to turn blue. Another morning was coming to Begnas Tal.
Begnas Tal is cut off from the tide of noise and excitement that floods into any place worthy of being in guidebooks and tourist maps.
When the sun came up from a cleft between the hills in the east, molten gold seemed to have spilled into the lake. A perfect cone appeared behind the hills—Machhapuchhre. Eagles and Egyptian vultures wheeled above the paddy fields. I kept imagining Pokhara’s Lakeside. It felt like in Begnas I had found the lost paradise that was Pokhara.
Shops here are limited to a handful of peddlers selling trinkets from a backpack or displaying their ware on a sheet on the lake’s shore.
Begnas Tal is cut off from the tide of noise and excitement that floods into any place worthy of being in guidebooks and tourist maps. Although this lake does see a lot of visitors as the day progresses, it never degrades into something that necessitates an escape. Shops here are limited to a handful of peddlers selling trinkets from a backpack or displaying their ware on a sheet on the lake’s shore. A wayward cab or motorbike honks its horn once in a while. Otherwise, pressure cookers whistles and eagle calls fill the air.
Begnas gets a little noisy once every morning. That is when the day’s catch is brought to the shop. A small crowd gathers there, hollering, pointing, watching their buys being gutted and cleaned. Some of them come all the way from Pokhara to buy fresh fish. Equally restless are the eagles perched on trees near the shop, trilling in anticipation of the meal of fish innards that will be their breakfast. Nearby, on the edges of artificial ponds where fish are raised, egrets stood transfixed, poised to strike.


Others liked to do their own catching. Walking along the southern shore of the lake, I came upon several men squatting. Fishing lines wrapped around Pepsi bottles and corn cobs rested at their feet. Once in a while one of them hauled out a fish—a little excitement, then another spell of silence. There was a plethora of activities to do around Begnas Tal. But no matter what you did, silence and stillness seemed a prerequisite.
Lured by the houseless, forested hills and the mountains beyond them, I went up the stony trail that wove up from the southwestern corner of the lake. Within moments I was in another world. Closely packed sal trees hid the lake. The forest floor was a crispy carpet of leaves, making walking silently impossible. In the quiet of morning this crunching was loud enough to spook Kalij pheasants, many of whom burst out in flights, emitting frantic alarm calls.
From a few places on the trail, hidden corners of the lake came into view through a gap between the trees; then, the trail changed slightly, and the lake was gone.
A short walk away from Begnas Tal was like a discovery to an outsider like me. I came upon tiny ponds nestled in the folds of hills. Going up the road from the main bazaar, I came suddenly to a temple that offered splendid views of the mountains and lake. And I could take any of the countless trails skirting the lake and I’d be rewarded with solitude.
I often wondered how Begnas Tal had managed to retain its original beauty and quaintness despite being a mere 15 kilometers from Pokhara. And I feared that I’d return to it one day to find it turned into a replica of Pokhara’s Lakeside.

And I feared that I’d return to it one day to find it turned into a replica of Pokhara’s Lakeside, all glitzy with shops and restaurants and noisy with honking vehicles. But there was time before Begnas became another paradise that was lost to development. There would be at least one more morning of silhouettes and silence, of a stillness that is remembered long after the place where it was encountered has changed unrecognisably.



Buses leave every fifteen minutes or so from Prithvi Chok in Pokhara for Begnas. Cycling is also a rewarding, if slightly taxing, way of getting from Pokhara to Kathmandu. If you’re coming from Kathmandu, ask your bus driver to drop you off at the crossroads to Lekhnath VDC. From there you can get on the bus coming from Pokhara.


The area surrounding the 3.6 square kilometer expanse of Begnas Tal is a place to rejuvenate both body and mind. Whether you prefer to be on land or water, like walks or whiling away time doing nothing in particular, love forests or mountains, Begnas has what you wish for.
Walks
Nothing beats early morning walks along the shore of Begnas. If you’re walking while it’s still dark, go for a walk on the dyke. Perhaps you can talk a fisherman into letting you accompany him on a fishing trip. Sunrise and sunsets on the lake are surreal.
It’s possible to do a complete circuit of the lake, but the trails are not well maintained. And it would take hours to complete a round. The best short walks are east and west of the boat dock; the western trail will take you into sal forests, while the eastern one passes along the lake.
Picnics
There are numerous places on the trails around Begnas that offer ideal spots for a picnic. The southern side is best as it offers plenty of shade and wonderful views of the mountains.
Cycling
Although the trails around the lake are perhaps too risky for all but the most skilled mountain bikers, there are other places for cycling. The paved road up from the main bazaar is a taxing climb but will reward with an unforgettable panorama of Begnas and the snowy peaks. A trail also runs west from the main bazaar, turns towards Begnas and joins the dyke, completing the loop via the boat dock.
Boating
Boat rides is a wonderful way to take in the beauty of the lake and its surroundings. It’s best to go on rides either early in the morning or late in the evening. At these times, the mellow light bathes the lake surface in splendid hues.

Most places offering lodging are located near the boat dock, which is a five-minute walk from the bus park in Begnas Bazar. The Grand Hotel Begnas has spacious and clean rooms and a rooftop restaurant. Places with simpler amenities but stellar views are clustered on the bluff above the southwestern corner of the lake. For those of you with deep pockets, head to Begnas Lake Resort on the eastern shore.

Adventure and reflection in mists of Nepal’s Sindhupalchowk,"Wednesday, July 6, 2016","Mist is probably one of the greatest abstracts for lovers of art and nature alike.
It coats the air with a soothing coolness as it billows in and out of deep valleys and rolls over cliffs, adding more mystery to the mystical hills of Nepal.
Hills look better with it. It probably also makes the demanding lives of the villages a little easy.


My trip meter showed ‘80 kilometers’ when I reached Sindhupalchowk, where the Sunkoshi meets the roaring Bhotekoshi. Hike uphill a day towards Ghorthali and after an additional two hours towards Lapse, you will reach the heart of the district. These places, I feel, preserve the authenticity of the enduring rural life, typical to the whole country.


For the outsider, the feeling of adventure lies in walking all day in these far-flung lands and then being greeted unexpectedly with streams that cross their path. It continues while crossing the many not-so-stable suspension bridges with wooden planks.
But what is adventure without a little reflection? The sore body finds respite under the shade of decades-old trees, and you lose yourself to the impossibly blue waters of the Sunkoshi, which follows you everywhere.


Standing on top of a hill while looking at another at the opposite end, you wonder if they continue forever, just like the enduring lives of its denizens.
Humble are the people here who enjoy simple lives. These were the same lives which were destroyed by the quakes last year.


The district is, perhaps, a testament and a constant reminder that nature can’t be controlled. Here, everything has its own pace like the mist. Everything comes and goes.
All we can do is hope for the better and continue living.

Four things a conscious trekker to the Annapurna Circuit needs to do,"Monday, July 4, 2016","Trekking in the Annapurna Conservation Area is no doubt one of the best travel experiences Nepal offers.
After getting there, you will surely agree that the Himalayas are one of the top seven Natural wonders of the world.
Whether you pick the 4-5 day trek to Poon Hill or decide to take an adventure through the whole Annapurna Circuit, you will get an opportunity to see diverse landscapes of lush forests, rushing rivers and waterfalls and, of course, impossibly beautiful mountain views.
You will encounter friendly locals as you adventure through small villages and, if you’re lucky, see some exotic and endangered animals. (Watch out for the leeches, though!)

While you trek through the mountains, it is important to remember that they are home to many local people and wildlife and as much as your visit is greatly appreciated, there are some rules you should be mindful of.
As a conscious trekker, I would suggest you keep these four things in mind:
Cutting trees is not allowed inside the Conservation Area. So, firewood is brought from elsewhere and carried up the hills on horseback. Because of this, hot showers are sometimes a rare luxury.

Guesthouses charge Rs 50-150 for hot showers. So, even as your muscles ache or you are in the mood of that nice, long, hot shower, think of the locals who carried the wood up the hills. Don’t bargain with them and try to limit the time you spend in the shower. Remember, you can spend a day in the warm water in the natural hot springs in Jinhu!
Don’t light fires inside the conservation area.
It would sound pretty obvious that you need to protect wildlife in a conservation area. While you are in the area, it will make more sense to you. I recommend that you do not touch the animals or take them outside the conservation area with you. This could go a long way in protecting wildlife.

As much as possible, try to keep your garbage with you and dispose it off when you leave the conservation area. Places like Pokhara have a better waste and recycling programme and do not require locals and horses to bring trash down the mountain.
Please don’t buy plastic water bottles. Take one or two bottles with you and buy water purification tablets before you leave. Most tablets will purify 1l of water in around 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can buy boiled water from your guesthouse for around Rs 50.
Try to use toilets whenever possible. Most guesthouses will let you use their toilets free of charge, but remember to bring your biodegradable toilet paper as they won’t have it. If a toilet is not available, make sure you relieve yourself at least 30 m away from any water source.
Food prices are fixed and set according to altitude. As you climb higher, so does the price of the meals. Respect the prices and don’t try to bargain when it comes to food.

Being immersed in the nature of the Annapurna region of the Himalayas is a truly unique experience. You have the opportunity to experience culture unlike anywhere else on Earth. It is important that visitors do their part to keep the mountains beautiful for locals and other trekkers for years to come.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/four-things-conscious-trekker-annapurnas-needs.html,travel
Following the Kaligandaki to Tibet: In four photos,"Tuesday, June 28, 2016","In November last year, the governments of Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding to open seven new customs points along the northern border.
Of the seven new points, Korala, the crossing between Tibet and Mustang has been seen as one of the most important ones for the future of Nepal-China trade.

However, at the moment it is not easy to get to Korala. The preferred route for most people, including hi-ranking army officials is one that involves following the mighty Kali Gandaki from Mustang’s Jomsom. Korala is located at a distance of 93 km from Jomsom
The journey is definitely not for the faint-hearted. You need to move quietly past giant boulders guarding the banks of the sacred river, and any error in driving is punished severely.

Recently, this author accompanied a Nepali army team and other government officials to the border crossing. We started off in Myagdi’s Beni, and then made our way north through Tatopani, Ghasa, Marpha and Jomsom.
Then our journey took us to Kagbeni and Chusang.

The team made several stops en route to the border crossing to take some measurements. It looked at how wide the track was, and how much area was covered with vegetation.


After passing through Lomanthang, we reached Choser, the village closest to the border crossing. The customs office is at the border crossing is located in Dhumwasen District of Tibet.

On the other side of the border, the Chinese government has setup basic infrastructure. It has fenced the border crossing and solar panels have been installed to power the army base.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/following-kaligandaki-tibet-4-photos.html,travel
Bardia National Park: A Lullaby of Crunching Bones,"Wednesday, June 8, 2016","The bus stopped in complete darkness. The only light was the tiny bulb in the sentry’s post; it was hard to tell if the soldier was awake or snoozing. My companion and I got off and the bus moved away, its roar and taillights getting fainter and fainter until it drowned in the dense darkness.
We could only feel the asphalt road under our feet. There were no people around, no noise, only the outlines of huge sal trees towering all around us.
My companion and I shuffled toward a faint light coming from a hut. A woman was busy feeding splinters of wood to an adobe hearth, coaxing the dozing fire to rise. We ordered tea. Dawn was still an hour away. The only sight available was the feeble fire with our tea brewing over it, the woman the only other person awake in the small settlement. This thin presence of people and sounds associated with human habitation seemed apt, for we were on the edge of Bardia National Park, the largest protected area in Nepal’s lowlands.

After paying the bewilderingly low sum of Rs 20 for four cups of tea, we set off for Thakurdwara, a Tharu village into which lodges and resorts had been grafted. No transportation was available at that hour. The resort we were going to stay in had informed us that their only vehicle had broken down. I decided to walk the twelve kilometers to Thakurdwara, assuming the exertion would be offset by the bucolic setting we would pass through.
The sun struggled to get through the blanket of winter haze spread over the land. In over three hours of walking the only form of transportation we saw was a bullock cart. But it was going in the opposite direction. Our huge backpacks and trekkers’ clothes drew long stares from children and adults and buffaloes. Then the last of the Tharu houses disappeared, and with it the sweet ‘namaste’ that children lavished on us from doorways and courtyards, and we entered a small forest.
The dirt road wove through a sal colonnade. We were hemmed in by the dense undergrowth on either side. As we walked we heard the rushing of feet, some light, some heavy, on the crunchy forest floor. I began to feel out of place—a feeling I’ve come to take as the parameter for a wilderness.

Feeling out of place is charming in a place like Thakurdwara. The wildlife makes sure you never feel at home. I was brushing my teeth before bed when a squealing and thrashing in the bougainvillea bush outside my window startled me. I shone my headlamp into the bush and found a civet with a mouse dangling from its mouth. I turned off the light, returned to bed, and spend the next half an hour listening to the crunching of bones.
Enough spills over from the wilderness on to your doorsteps, windows and gardens in Thakurdwara, from the early morning calls of jungle fowl to the iridescent purple sunbird flitting among the flowers. But that only whets the appetite; the real feast is inside the national park. We decided to try our luck too and went on a jungle walk, with the high hopes of seeing the big beasts—tiger, rhino, elephant.

A walk through Bardia’s jungle in the early morning was like moving through a neighborhood of musicians tuning their instruments. Birds chirped as they warmed themselves on the tips of elephant grass. Dew fell on brittle leaves, the sound intensified in the morning quiet. Kingfishers dove into rivers, emerging with breakfast. Eagles screeched and ducks let off sonorous cries. To our silence-deprived ears the jungle was a silent place, but it was actually a symphony of dozens of blended sounds, the soundtrack of an ecosystem.
We spent half an hour up in a machan, or wooden tower, a couple of hours in a hideout on a river bank, and some hours walking from one spot famous for wildlife sightings to another. But the tiger eluded us, elephants remained hidden somewhere, and rhinos were not in the mood for saying hello.

Our day in the jungle ended without a glimpse of these animals. But we spent enough time waiting for these beasts to sink one level deeper into the wilderness, to understand that the beauty of a wilderness lies in the forgotten links it revives—whether through a tiger sighting or the sound of a kingfisher diving in.



A road trip, on private or public transportation, is a rewarding way to get to Bardia National Park. If you travel by road, you will be on the East-West Highway, passing through a countryside largely unspoiled by development. Take any of the several daily buses that depart for Dhangadhi or Mahendranagar from the New Bus Park in Kathmandu.
For swifter escapes from the concrete jungle to Bardia’s jungles take the daily flight to Nepalgunj. From there Thakurdwara is 87 km. Resorts are happy to send vehicles to fetch you for an extra fee. Other options include taking local buses to Ambassa from Nepalgunj. Getting from Ambassa to Thakurdwara (12 km) is tricky as local transportation is not very reliable. Be prepared to wait there a while if you haven’t made arrangements for a ride.

In Bardia, you are not only close to a wilderness but amidst a fascinating ethnic group, the Tharus. Their culture is sustainable living taken to the level of art. Every home is a lesson in minimalist living, with houses and articles of daily use made from jungle resources. Saunter through the villages and ask for permission to enter these lovely houses. The Tharu Cultural Museum at the national park entrance gate also showcases the indigenous culture.
The crocodile breeding center, located near the park’s main entrance, offers the chance to watch predators like mugger crocodiles and gharials from mere inches away.
Combine your trip to the wild with a religious side trip by visiting the Thakur Baba Temple.
If you are not pressed for time, the Blackbuck Conservation Area is certainly worth visiting. Besides being the last remaining wild herd of blackbuck in Nepal, it is also the northernmost distribution of the species in the world.

Every third building or so in Thakurdwara is a lodge or a resort. Bardia Adventure Resort has separate cottages and Tharu-style huts sequestered in a mini jungle. It has open fields on one side, a haunt of cranes and jungle fowl. The Mango Tree Lodge is a celebration of traditional Tharu architecture, with rooms furnished to reflect the simple beauty of the indigenous culture. Several Tharu households have homestay facilities, although they are located a little further from the national park’s main entrance.

Khaptad: A banquet for the senses,"Wednesday, June 1, 2016","The only sound was the faraway cawing of ravens. Then they flew farther away, taking all sound with them, and I was left with the immensity of a high-altitude meadow fringed with forests to gorge on. Solitude couldn’t have been deeper.
I was in Khaptad National Park, a 225 sq. km. swathe of forests interspersed with verdant meadows in Nepal’s far-western Region. Most places in the park were like that, the only notable exception being the corner where a Nepal Army barracks and national park offices sit. But even these, the only permanent human habitations in the park, were quiet save for the sputtering diesel generator that ran sometimes. All I needed to do was walk for ten minutes in any direction from these buildings, and I would be in a lonely corner of the immense wilderness.
I didn’t know how to take in silence so deep, so prolonged. If I did, I would have sat or stood in one place and let the stillness percolate into me. Instead, I walked aimlessly, stopping to examine leopard pugmarks or to listen to a brook gurgling down a meadow. I could go down to Khaptad Daha, a sacred lake, and sit for hours without seeing another person, my only company a tiny bird that hopped inches from me. I had sweeping views of mountains (and a fickle cell phone network) from a hill top mere minutes away from the barracks. I was deprived (though I never lamented it) the basic amenities that I took for granted, but Khaptad was an inexhaustible banquet for the senses.
But you need an appetite for beauty that comes from isolation. “Khaptad is fun for people like you, who come to stay for a couple of days,” one army officer told me. “After months in this place, the beauty bores you.” I couldn’t relate to his statement: he had installed satellite television to escape Khaptad’s isolation; I had come to enjoy that seclusion. In fact, part of my reason for coming to Khaptad was to see the place where one man had spent fifty years alone, meditating and writing erudite books on spirituality. That was Khaptad Baba, an ascetic who decided to “settle” in Khaptad after arriving there on his way back from a pilgrimage to Mt. Kailash.
Although Khaptad Baba had passed away long ago his hermitage was still there. I decided to spend an afternoon there, in the foolish hope that the hut would still have some magic about it. The only thing I found there was the perfect setting for sitting still, which was what I had trouble doing. I came back from the hermitage with the realisation that the true magic of a place lies in the invitation it extends to turn inwards.

What I found in Khaptad (what anyone will find) was a place whose beauty took your mind off from where you had come or where you were going. Moments were what mattered there. A stay in Khaptad is a severing of links with the outside world—even if at the most superficial of levels. And you acquaint yourself with new sights and sounds: the osprey that hovered over the meadows, the sudden burst of wings as you walked in the forest, long silences, the immense landscape of trees, clouds and blue skies.
A vast wilderness like Khaptad appeals to the equally vast wilderness within each of us, a place we rarely visit, to the point that we forget it exists. Khaptad’s serenity and tranquility is best left to photographers and poets to capture and relate. It’s ephemeral. It’s personal. You may remember Khaptad for its scenery or its wildlife or its otherworldliness. For me, it’s the place that reminded me of the sanctuary within.


The trek to Khaptad begins from Silgadi, in Doti district. To get there from Kathmandu you can either take one of the several daily buses to Dhangadi or Mahendranagar in Nepal far-western Region. Get off at Attariya, a settlement on the East-West Highway. Another way to get to Attariya is to take the daily flight from Dhangadi, then take a local bus to the highway. Several buses and microbuses to Silgadi depart from Attariya. From Silgadi you can take a jeep to Jhigrana, the entry point to Khaptad National Park. However, whole sections of the road are frequently washed out during monsoons, closing it for months on end. Trekking remains the best option. It takes two days to get to Khaptad from Silgadi.Over half a dozen buses leave daily from Kathmandu for Mahendranagar. The journey takes 15-18 hours. Tickets are available in Sundhara. There are also daily flights from Kathmandu to Dhangadhi. From Dhangadhi, it is an hour by road to Mahendranagar. Arrangements for transportation from the airport should be made in advance, as taxis are not always available at the airport. However, buses are available on the main road, which is two kilometers from the airport.
Public transport is almost non-existent on the road from Mahendranagar to the reserve’s entrance eight kilometers away. Hired jeeps are indispensable as jungle walks are not permitted .

Sitapaila
You will pass by this tiny temple on your way to the army barracks. The tiny footprint etched on the floor is said to be of Sita.
Tribeni Mandir
Scenic and sacred, the Tribeni Temple is located at the confluence of two streams. A festival is held here annually, drawing hundreds of people. Bathing in the waters near this temple is believed to wash away all sins.
Sahasra Linga
This is another sacred site in Khaptad. The shrine is perched on a monolith well over three thousand meters above sea-level. Beside its religious importance, it offers some of the best views of the Saipal and Api ranges.
Khaptad Baba hermitage
Tucked in the middle of a forest, this hermitage is the ideal place for tuning in to nature and spending time sitting still. Cut away from even the amiable army men and national park staffers, this place is a little piece of the Khaptad before it came to the attention of anyone besides the local cowherds and Khaptad Baba.
Patans
If you’ve seen photos of Khaptad, chances are that they were of its famed meadows, patans in Nepali. There are twenty-two patans in Khaptad, couple of them in the vicinity of the army barracks. Ghodadauney Patan is the largest of these. Walking an extra twenty minutes northwest of Ghodadauney will get you to Naagdhunga, a rock with serpent-like formations on it.
Khaptad Daha
There is perhaps no other place as idyllic as this in Khaptad. The small lake is in the middle of a forest. There is also Khaparmandu, an old temple on the south-eastern shore. A short hike to the hill north of the lake affords enrapturing mountain views.

Dhangadi has plenty of places to stay, from basic lodges to some high-end hotels. Silgadi has fewer and simpler places to stay. Jhigrana has one or two homestays. Places to stay in Khaptad are limited to the army barracks and the national park staff quarters. Unless you have made arrangements with someone in these places, you need to carry tents. There are also no places to buy food and other goods inside the national park, so carry all your provisions. Trekking alone is not recommended in what is one of Nepal’s largest wildernesses. Travel in a group, with a local guide.

Three reasons why you should visit Bhedetar this summer,"Wednesday, May 25, 2016","
Nepal’s western region has traditionally been home to the most attractive of tourist destinations in the country. The tourist hub of Pokhara is in the west, and so is Mustang, where people from around the world come to experience nature and its beauty.
It would not be a hyperbole to say that Nepal’s east is equally beautiful as the west, and Bhedetar can lay claim to the number one destination for nature lovers.
Until ten years ago, Bhedetar, a hill station in Nepal’s eastern hills was not on the Nepal’s tourism entrepreneur’s radar. But in the last few years a number of hotels and  resorts have come up on the once-remote hilltop.
Here we have top three reasons why you should consider going to Bhedetar for vacation this summer.
Those people who have been to Bhedetar say that its main attraction is its weather. You might reach there on a sunny day, but soon the clouds will gather, and the weather will change. It is a perfect destination for summer. Located at an altitude of around 1,420 metres above sea level, the hill station never experiences heat. That is why people from UP and Bihar frequent Bhedetar to beat the heat, local say.


According to Hotel Association of Nepal (HAM) there are over 35 hotels in Bhedetar. There are 10 more star hotels that are coming up in the area. HAN’s Bhedetar chapter, the hotels in Bhedetar can accommodate up to a thousand tourists at a time.
Bhedetar is not just for a relaxed holiday. The place has something to offer for thrill seekers as well. Nine km down the trail, there is the Namaste Waterfall, which the locals also call Simsuwa. You can take a dip in the cold water or go canoeing in the river. There is also the option of paragliding from Bhedetar to Dharan, one of the biggest cities in the east.

"For elephants in Nepal’s Sauraha, humane treatment is a cry in the wilderness","Sunday, May 22, 2016","Our first excursion to Sauraha marked a radical change for us. Having lived in Kathmandu for some time, I saw only a few things common between the two places.
The first things you notice in Sauraha, that the area is rich with forests and wildlife, that have made the woods their home. Then you notice that there is an unprecedented tourism boom happening there.
Walk down the road, and you will see hotels and travel agencies everywhere—all drawing on the riches of the nearby sanctuary to attract tourists. The boom, however, may not be good news for everyone, especially for ‘private’ elephants in the resort town.
Before I say anything about them, I must admit that having witnessed the sad spectacle of a badly beaten elephant, it would be hard for me talk about it with objectivity.
Elephant rides, or ‘safaris’ are organised for tourists by local hotels and agencies. Many elephants held privately are mobilised 365 days a year, sometimes from 6 am to 8 pm. These conditions lead to disastrous degradation of the health of the mammals.
Significant dietary deficiencies due to poor diet, joint problems, infections and abscesses in the foot are some of the many things that these elephants must live with.
The few foreigners who participated in a safari, with whom I got the chance to discuss the issue, admitted to having some remorse.
They stated that the attractive prices and the unusual nature of the activity seduced them into it. Moreover, they were unaware of the elephant torture issue.
According to the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015, Nepal ranks 25th among the countries with the most attractive natural resources. It can be safely said that the main attraction of this region is its wildlife.
It is possible to combine tourism with humane practices, and that can be done when tourists are aware of what is going on.
Some of the onus lies with tourists who can affect changes in Chitwan. It is important to encourage initiatives in this direction in order to preserve Sauraha’s wildlife, which is rich, but fragile.

"Up, up and Chandragiri: Kathmandu’s first cable car to be launched within a month","Thursday, May 19, 2016","
The residents of Kathmandu, and its surrounding areas, will soon have a new destination to go on a quick getaway. Once only accessible by foot, the hilltop of Chandragiri, southwest of the Valley, will soon welcome visitors with a newly installed cable car system.
Currently on trail, the cable cars at Chandragiri will come into operation sometime next month. From the base station at Godam, near Thankot, the 2.5 km ropeway will take you to the top of Chandragiri, where several tourist attractions are under construction.
Once completed, the hilltop will not only serve as a vantage point to observe the ever-expanding Kathmandu, but will also become the go-to place for those seeking an escape from the hullabaloo of the capital.
According to Kathmandu Fun Park Pvt Ltd, the company behind the project, a 6D theatre, shopping area, restaurants and a view tower are also being built on the hill top.
Chandragiri is also home the temple of Ichchapureshwor, the god believed to have powers to grant wishes. “The construction work is nearing completion,” says Chandra Dhakal of Kathmandu Fun Park. “We are expecting up to 10,000 visitors during holidays.”

Standing tall at an altitude of 2600 m above sea level, Chandragiri has always been a popular choice among hikers. With the newly installed cable car system, the site will become accessible to even those who do not like hiking.
The hill is famous for its ever-changing weather. It is here that a thick blanket of mist forms and then disappears, only to form again. On a good day, almost all the major peaks along the northern vista can be seen from the hill. If you look south, you can even see the Terai.
For those who wish to spend more than an afternoon at Chandragiri, a resort is also under construction. The five-star property will have a total of 100 rooms.

Sneak peak: A new five-star resort is coming up in Lumbini. Tiger Palace is its name,"Thursday, May 12, 2016","
A multi-national company based in Hong Kong is building a five-star luxury resort in Kotihawa, Lumbini, and it plans to invest over Rs 3 billion in the project.
The new resort, ‘Tiger Palace’, will cover over six acres of land, and will have four hundred rooms, says Rajendra Bajagain, head of Silver Heritage’s Nepal unit.
Bajagain says that there will be a soft launch of the resort in November, and a formal commencement of business will take place at a later date.
“We are now working on the roofing. We will have 100 rooms ready by the time we open after a soft launch,” explains Bajagain. The company plans to invest Rs 1 billion more to build rest of the ooms.
The company says that the resort is targetted at Indian families looking for destination weddings in Nepal. Keeping in view the needs of such families, the resort will build a hall which will have a capacity to accommodate 700 people. Smaller halls will also be built, says Bajagain.
The new resort will have a spa, a tennis court and a children’s park. A casino is also in the works.

These hotels in Lumbini are all set to welcome tourists and pilgrims,"Friday, May 6, 2016","In Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha, several new luxury hotels have come into operation recently. The birthplace of Gautam Buddha is an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists all over the world.
Nepal’s hospitality sector has seen a surge in investment over the years, with several new luxury hotels opening up in Kathmandu and Pokhara.
Until a few years back, Lumbini, arguably the third most important tourist town after Kathmandu and Pokhara, had several hotels and guesthouses in operation that mostly only welcomed pilgrims. But with the renewed zeal seen in the tourism sector, it is the first time that the town is gearing up to welcome additional tourists with its many luxury offerings.
Here, we look at ten hotels and resorts that have served visitors to Lumbini and the neighbouring Bhairahawa over the years.

Located inside the perimeter of Lumbini Development trust, Hotel Kasai has been in operation since 2009. Primarily targeted to the Japanese pilgrims, the luxury hotel is one of the most expensive hotels in the area.
The tariff for a single bedroom here is fixed at 120 USD per night, whereas a double bedroom costs 150 USD per night. The hotel offers special discounted rates for Indian and Nepali nationals at Rs 4700 for single bedroom and Rs 6400 for a double bedroom per night.
Hotel Kasai has a total of 30 rooms, two of which are suites. Although the hotel primarily serves Japanese cuisine, its two restaurants also serve Nepali, Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisine.
Operated by veteran tourism entrepreneur Karna Shakya, Hotel Buddha Maya Garden stands amidst a sprawling garden inspired by the Mayadevi temple nearby.

What’s stopping you from going to Rara?,"Tuesday, May 3, 2016","For years, the sheer mention of Rara Lake has evoked the vision of pristine beauty as well as impeding remoteness to prospective visitors.
Located in the mid-western region of Nepal, Rara remains a destination that many have heard of, but only those brave enough to go beyond their comfort zones have actually visited the region.
For one, the region was incredibly hard to reach. Getting there meant going on a treacherous hike that lasted weeks. But with commercial flights operating to and from the Talcha Airport nearby, the once isolated region has suddenly become accessible to all.

The ease of access can be attributed to the recent construction of road near the lake area which covers the village of Karkibada and runs alongside the airport before ending near the lake. From there, the lake is only 3-4 hours’ hike away.
Rara has never been so accessible.

After a pleasant hike that passes through thin alpine forests and vegetations, you will reach Rara.
Nestled calmly at the foot of small hills, which make the peaks beyond appear even taller, the first sight of the lake is truly a one to behold.

The lake shimmers in the sunlight, reflecting everything the impossibly clear waters has taken in as if it were a canvas painted in azure blue and turquoise.

All over, a beautiful harmony of nature is created by the surrounding forests, where the deep red of rhododendron flowers weaves in and out of the verdant forests.

During balmy summer evenings, the lake seduces you to hold all thoughts and reflect.

"Arun Chaudhary’s mantra: Five hotels, five years, five billion rupees","Sunday, May 1, 2016","
Arun Chaudhary is Chairman of CG Holdings, a part of Chaudhary Group. CG Holdings, which is a big name in the automotive sector, recently announced its plans to invest big in the hotel industry. The company recently acquired Tigerland Safari Resort in Chitwan. According to to Chaudhary, CG Holdings also plans to bring in Holiday Inn, an American brand of hotels, to manage one of its hotels.
Onlinekhabar talked to Chaudhary recently about his strategy for the hotel industry.
CG Holdings is a big name in the Nepali auto business, but you are new to the hotel industry. What attracted you the the hospitality sector?
A businessman is always looking for opportunities. We invest in areas where we see opportunities. It is in the tourism sector that we see the most potential these days. If you look at the competitive advantage Nepal’s tourism has on offer, tourism is second to none. That is why we decided to invest in the hospitality industry.
Could you tell us about your portfolio?
Our portfolio, if you look at the worth of our business, is dominated by the automotive sector at the moment. But in the next five years, we want our hospitality business to grow to become the biggest sector for us. Ideally, we would like a balance between trading, real estate, education and hospitality.
You said you want to invest in the ‘hospitality industry’. Although hotels form a big part of the industry, there’s more to it.
Yes. Everything that is needed to welcome guests, give them a good stay and bid them farewell is part of the hospitality industry. We will invest in everything.

Could you tell us how you plan to go about running your five hotels?
We will bring in an investment of Rs 5 billion for five hotels over a period of five years.
Tigerland Resort is already in operation. We have already signed a letter of intent with Holiday Inn, and hopefully we’ll will start work on our five-star hotel in Jhamsikhel after the monsoon.
We will then begin work on our business hotel in Tripureshwor, and then on the high-end wellness centre in Budhanilkantha. We will then build a hotel in Pokhara.
I would like you to note that people can own a part of the wellness centre we are building. They can rent their unit to the management company, and they can become a partner in prosperity.

You said that Holiday Inn will manage one of your hotels. Do you plan to get other international chains to manage your other hotels?
We are weighing our options. The main reason we wanted to bring in Holiday Inn was that we can learn from them to develop our managerial skills. Once we gain experience, we could even start our own management company.
I think that international chains have a network that spreads around the world. They are very good at getting people to come to their hotels. They are in a better position to market their hotels.
Which market segment are your hotels going to cater to?
We are looking at the mid-range tourists because they are the ones who make up the biggest travelling group around the world. We also think that domestic tourists would also enjoy the experience we will offer.
I am investing in the hotel sector because I am fully confident that it has a huge potential. I am not in it because of herd mentality.
Although big new hotels are coming into operation soon, tourist arrivals have not increased at the same rate. How will the new hotels get business?
Not being able to attract quality tourists is our weakness. But this should not be a reason to not invest. Anyone who invests in hotels looks for guests, and this will eventually increase the number of arrivals.

Will your priorities change, now that you have entered the hospitality business?
We look at each business as a separate entity. If I were to talk to you about automobiles, I would only talk about automobiles, similar is the case with real estate. You could say that we give equal priority to all of our businesses.
Do you plan to take your hotel business beyond Nepal?
I do not have immediate plans to do so, we have just entered the business. We should focus on becoming strong in Nepal. It would not be appropriate for me to talk about big things at the moment.
Do you believe in beginners’ luck?
Well, I do believe in luck. But luck can only take you to one level, after that it is your commitment and hard work that counts.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/arun-chaudharys-mantra-five-hotels-five-years-five-billion-rupees.html,travel
The challenge that is Balthali,"Wednesday, April 27, 2016","If the hills could talk, they’d tell you I’m a crummy hiker. They’d tell you that I get lost midway, and that I gasp for breath to cover the last stretch.
But I’d do it all again to get out of town–to at least get away from this cavalcade of dust that we receive in the name of city expansion.
The hills and the stretch of muddy roads opened up, inviting and challenging us and to make us realise that city life has softened us all.
Reaching Balthali wasn’t a journey that had us just ride our bikes up to the destination. We stopped at the bus stop near Panauti and hiked from there on. The heat was beating down and slowly, the hills got steeper. All of it would seem like a normal hike up a hill, but what really struck me was how isolated we were from everything.
The trek up to Balthali Eco Hill Resort, where we were staying for the night, is steep and it becomes painfully clear when you’re on your way down (more on that later). The property itself sits on top of a hill with no houses distracting the awesome view. It is one of those sprawling retreats dotted around the Kathmandu Valley.
The resort is one of those places that have close to zero occupants most of the time, and yet run year after year.
***
While traversing and minding my own business, I ended up traveling these beautiful beaten paths. I was walking alone, just thinking as I have always done. My friends were merely catching up, I thought. A call:
Where the hell are you?
I am walking, where are you?
We are on the right track up, turn around!
I should have known. The only time I ever lead a line was when I was under the influence of three bottles of beer, and there was just one bathroom at the pub.
After swallowing my pride, I walked back to realise that I had clearly deviated from a point that really should have had better signs. The right path should have me going up a hill with bamboos as stair supports.
After having walked 2 km or so pointlessly, I had decided to rest every 200 metres. With due diligence I hiked up. What sprawled open before me was a beautiful spot that can only be described as a paradise in a pocket. The people were warm, the abodes were comfortable and it just goes to show how much people in Nepal value visitors ans guests.
After spending a glorious night at the resort, then waking up to see Kobe Bryant play his last game (yes, I am a city boy) we headed down to a swimming spot. We traversed on what has to be the most dangerous downhill hike I have ever encountered. And I hiked down from Namchhe.
The fallen flora just makes it unbelievably difficult for you to get any grip. The trip down had dead leaves and fallen branches blocking our way, not to mention there was absolutely no real space to put your foot down. Around me, all people feared of someone slipping because if they did, it wasn’t going to be pretty. Somehow, some way, all of us made our way down only to find this pool to be extremely shallow and already populated. So much for nothing!
The trip back up was surprisingly easy and what really challenged us was getting to the buses in time to get back home before sundown. As we all crammed ourselves into the bus, we all longed for the city. It is a strange realisation, that tell you that maybe you’re not ready for the hills.
But take nothing from it. Balthali is an amazing getaway. For those who look to traverse just a little further, gain just a little tranquility; it takes the cake. The fact that it is not all too well-known adds to its allure. You know that you will at least find some peace up there.
One of the most poignant moments during the entire trip was when we decided to rest while hiking downhill. All of us looked back up to the resort we were staying at and marveled at how far down we had come.
It was at this point one of our seniors looked at us with a bewildered expression and bluntly said, “Ka tyo ho mula, tyo po ho ni!” pointing at a hill even further up with only a tin sheet glinting through the tall trees.
Maybe I would do alright in the village.


While your mighty motorbike might take you to Balthali (depending on how much you love your trusty bike), it is advisable to take a bus to Khopasi.
Several buses to Panauti leave from Kathmandu’s Old Bus Park daily. You will reach Panauti via Thimi, Bhaktapur and Sanga in about 3-4 hours. After you reach Panauti, catch a ride to Khopasi, the starting point of the hike.
Once you reach Khopasi it’s a straight up hike. It is very advisable to keep asking what route you’re on because some of us end up lost following a simple road.
The main junction is one that will lead you to a bamboo support mud staircase that takes you to the steepest part of the hike. Go up, with all your stamina in tow because you will need it.

The Balthali Eco Hill Resort (9851168851) provides comfortable accommodation in its many rooms and tents. An executive deluxe room fitted with all modern amenities can also be booked. If you are more of the outdoor type, book a tent. It provides great views of sunrise from the comfort of your bed.

The elusive lake: A trek to Gosaikunda in 8 photos,"Tuesday, April 19, 2016","The Gosainkunda lakes are located inside the Langtang National Park in Rasuwa District, but which Gosaikunda you see during your visit will depend on the season you make your journey.
The lakes, located at an altitude of 4380m above sea level change their appearance depending on the weather.
A total of 108 lakes of all sizes complete the Gosaikunda complex. For six months every year, the main lake stays frozen and the surrounding landscape also wears this solemn mood. When spring arrives, the takes a blue hue, and its surroundings a coat of lush green, at least for a few months.
That the lakes are never the same is appreciated by travelers from all over the world. The challenge of walking to the lakes, and the beauty of the trail attracts visitors to the area.

At Dhunche, a discreet sign tells you that the trek to Gosainkunda has begun.
To reach Gosainkunda from Dhunche the district headquarters of Rasuwa located near the southwest entrance of the national park)  you will have to trek to Chandanbari via Dhimsa and Deurali first. Dhunche is located at an altitude of 1,850m. After a night’s rest at Chandanbari, you can reach the lake complex the following day if you take the Lauribinayak route.

In Dhunche, during most mornings, the rising sun slowly envelops the hills with a warm glow. This gives trekkers much-needed motivation to hit the trail.

There are several suspension bridges along the trail. These contraption of metal cables and platform are not as stable as they look. But they often serve as a vantage point to savour the panoramic view of the landscape. The clear river, and the dense vegetation composed of oak, maple or even rhododendrons in all directions make you want to stay there forever.
You will be greeted by many monkeys along the trail. But stealthily observe these from afar. The slightest noise will scare them away.
At Dhimsa (3100m), the sky opens for a spectacular view of the Himalayan alpine region, which you cannot find on any postcards.
Lauribinayak is part of the last leg of the journey. You will be greeted by children along the trail, most of whom are candid with their curiosity and are charmingly playful.
At 3900m, the temperature drops quickly and the weather is more capricious. Don’t be surprised if you wake up in the morning to a thick snowfall.

The ruins of stupas from the recent earthquakes are a common sight along the trail.

When you finally reach Gosaikunda, any altitude sickness is replaced by the feeling of awe. During winters, snowstorms radically transform the landscapes and covers the are with a thick shroud of snow.
According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva dug these lakes with his trident, after swallowing poison while desperately looking for a source of cold water to stem the oppressive heat generated by his intoxication.

These six hotels redefine tourism in Nepal’s Lake City Pokhara,"Sunday, April 17, 2016","The hospitality industry in Pokhara is moving beyond its lakeside-centric market. Numerous hotels and resorts have come up on the outskirts of the city in areas previously less-frequented by tourists.
The newly-opened properties are all located on hills like Sarangkot, Nau Danda and Pumdi Bhumdi that surround the Pokhara Valley.
Lake Side, the most ‘touristy’ area in town has reached a saturation point when it comes to hotels and shops for tourists. This is the main reason why tourism entrepreneurs are looking elsewhere for business. Moreover, the price of real estate in the city has seen a dramatic increase in the recent years, and this has discouraged entrepreneurs to set shop there.
This renewed interest in areas beyond the main city gives a much-needed respite to the oftentimes sketchy tourism industry of the Lake City, which had until now been unable to expand to its full potential.
Here we look at six new hotels and resorts have opened for business in around Pokhara’s recently.

This hotel opened for business at the end of last year.  This sprawling four-star property is spread over an area of 5 ropanis, and is located in Sarangkot, northwest of the valley. Sarangkot is famous among tourists as a vantage point to view the Annapurnas.
The resort has seen a steady number of guests since its opening.  Japanese and European tourists come here in big numbers. But the resort equally welcomes domestic tourists, says owner Karna Shakya.
“The tariff for the rooms at the resort starts from Rs 5000 – 10,000,” says Kiran Khadka, resident manager of the resort.


Rupakot resort is located near the Begnas Lake where 12 villas equipped with all modern amenities welcome guests for a relaxing stay.
From every room of the resort, the operators say, you can take a peek at the Annapurna range.
The resort’s 42 deluxe rooms are priced at $ 300 per night. Discount is available for domestic tourists.

Located at around 20km away from the city centre, Himalayan Deurali Resort in Nau Danda is spread over a massive property of 330 ropanis.
The resort has six cottages with four rooms each. Designed to reflect a typical Gurung household, these 24 rooms are divided  into ‘deluxe’ and ‘super deluxe’ categories.
For foreigners, the tariff for a ‘deluxe’ room is set at $ 70-80 while a ‘super deluxe’ room can be rented at $ 80-100. The rates are different for domestic tourists. Nepalis can rent a ‘deluxe’ room at the resort for Rs 3,000 while a ‘super deluxe’ room can be rented for Rs 3,500.
The resort’s remoteness may hold appeal to those seeking a retreat from the banality of routine life. All of the resort’s rooms are built adjacent to the Machhapuchhre peak while its property stretches in all directions.
Frequented by Chinese tourists, the resort also has two in-house restaurants.

At Jimire, on the banks of the Begnas Lake, there is cluster of beautiful houses that look like a charming village. These 16 villas have 40 rooms, and are part of the Begnas Lake Resort & Villas.
Most guests who come to the resort prefer a half-hour boat ride across the lake to reach there. Those who do not prefer to boat can also walk to the resort. Once at the property, you will be welcomed by beautiful stone villas nestled on the foot of a dense forest with the lake just a stone throw’s away.
The rooms’ starting price has been fixed at around $120-130 while Nepalis can pay around Rs 4,000 to rent a room for a night.
This three-star property is spread over an area of 25 ropanis of land where banana, guava, oranges and many other fruits grow.

Raniban Retreat Resort’s location in the south-west part of the city near the World Peace Stupa offers the perfect vantage point to view the Pokhara city, and the mountain range beyond in all its glory.
Its 10 rooms are located in individual cottages which are divided into three categories; deluxe, sunrise view and mountain facing. The resort’s three mountain-facing rooms have their own private garden.
This eco-friendly resort is mostly run with power generated from solar panels. Solar energy powers its air conditioning as well as lighting.
The cost of the rooms start at around $90-160 for foreigners and Rs 4,000-5000 for Nepalis.

At Pumdi Bhumdi, The Pavilion Himalayan Resort has been providing traditional Nepali hospitality to its guests with a touch of modernity through its 15 luxury villas.
Located around 20 minutes away from Pokhara airport, the resort is spread over an area of 65 ropanis and houses almost all amenities required for a comfortable stay.
Apart from single and double rooms, the resort has a family suite, especially prepared for those travelling in a large group.
The tariff for the family suite is based on per bed basis and is charged $ 80 USD per bed. A single room costs $ 235, while a double room costs $ 360.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/six-hotels-redefine-tourism-nepals-lake-city-pokhara.html,travel
"Indra Sarovar: The lake is ‘artificial’, but its beauty is natural","Thursday, April 14, 2016","
As you move past Chitlang, passing through the road that leads all the way to Bhimfedi, you will reach Indra Sarovar, a massive lake that seems to cover an area of an entire village.
But the lake is not natural. It is actually a man-made reservoir meant to generate hydroelectricity.

The resulting beauty the surroundings exude, though, is comparable to the lakes, which form naturally. The unique location of the lake — it dips rolling hills into its water and then stretches in different directions — instead looks almost surreal, especially for an object that was created for pure utility.
For years, the lake and the power generating plants nearby (installed capacity 92 MW) have been steadily producing electricity.
At around 50 km from Kathmandu’s city centre, the reservoir can be reached via paved roads. Over the years, due to its ease of accessibility, the area surrounding the reservoir has seen a growth in the number of lodges and restaurants.
Apart from its function as a reservoir for generating electricity, Indra Sarovar has not only helped bring tourists to the area and given the local economy a boost. It also offers a different utility that again benefits the villagers of the area.
With the support of the government, enterprising villagers have started using the reservoir as a commercial breeding farm for fish which has steadily found a market over the years.
While there, you can also venture out to surrounding villages. A visit to the sheep breeding centre in Markhu, near the reservoir, can also be planned.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/indra-sarovar-lake-artificial-beauty-natural.html,travel
Salyan: The district less travelled by,"Monday, April 11, 2016","Salyan is a destination seldom travelled to by those looking for a vacation. The district, which lies in the mid-western part of the country, holds a different appeal though.
Greenery of all hues will assault your senses while you are in Salyan. Its idyllic villages and culture exude a familiarity that may seem boring at first. But this is immediately broken once you soak into the distinct lives of the district’s denizens whose faith and devotion supersedes all other aspect of their lives.

The region, home to many temples of religious significance, is also famous all over Nepal for its oranges and ginger. Traders from all over the country, and even India, come to buy these priced commodities from the farmers.
Kapurkot, the gateway to Salyan, has one of the country’s busiest markets from where fresh fruits and vegetables are dispatched to many cities of the country.
The fertility of the land here can be attributed to the bountiful river Sarda which cuts through the lower part of the district.



Nepalgunj is highly accessible by road and air from most parts of the country. Salyan lies 235km northeast from the city. You will reach Khalanga, Salyan’s district headquarter after a seven-hour bus ride from Nepalgunj.
Kapurkot, the gateway to the district, can be reached via the Rapti highway from Dang’s Tulsipur as well. This highway will further take you to Rukum. Alternatively, you could follow the Bheri river from Surkhet, and reach Salli Bazaar in western Salyan. This route will also take you to Jajarkot.


Around 24 km west of Khalanga, lies Kupinde village. Here, the sprawling Kupinde Lake makes for an awesome sight. Surrounded by hills on all sides, the lake has remained free from any tampering. It is truly pristine. Locals say that the lake changes its hue three times every year. A temple dedicated to Barahdev is located adjacent to the lake where devotees come to pay respect twice every year, once during February and the other time during April.
The temple dedicated to Chattreswori devi in Chayachetra is the only Shaktipith in Nepal where animals are not sacrificed. It is believed that Lord Shiva rested the dead body of his wife Satidevi in this temple.
The temple holds immense significance for Hindus. It is located 19 km away from the district headquarter Khalanga. Spread in over 50 ropanis of land, the sprawling temple complex is host to many rituals that is unique to the region. North to the temple, you can see a massive fossil, which is believed to hold the remnants of Satidevi. Locals believe that the fossil holds the entire district of Salyan (it is only visible to the faithful!).
In Sarada Municipality of the district, the temple of Khairabang is located. At around 1600 ft above sea level, the temple attracts visitors who want to do away with vices such as anger, greed, lust and jealousy.
The temple hosts thousands of devotees twice every year when for 15 days, animal sacrifices are offered to the temple’s goddess Bhawani Bhuwaneswari. The temple can be reached from Khalanga via road. The 27 ropanis of land where the temple is located is relatively organised and holds potential to transform into a major pilgrimage site.

If you plan to go backpacking, make sure you stock up on all essentials like toiletries and clean clothes. Food and accommodation is hard to come by so make sure you make Khalanga your base before venturing out to the other part of the district.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/devotees-come-pay-respect-twice-every-year-february-april.html,travel
8th Annual Poker Run: Tribute to one of Nepal’s roughest visionary riders,"Thursday, April 7, 2016","Any Nepali two-wheeler enthusiast will recognise the internationally-attended annual event known as the Enfield Rendezvous & Poker Run. In its 8th year now, Poker Run has grown from an event attended by a dozen or so local Enfield riders to hundreds of riders from around the globe, all celebrating the Nepali New Year together, and doing a few good deeds along the way as well.
For those unfamiliar with the term Poker Run (which is often confused with Pokhara Run), let me just say that this type of riding event is common amongst riding clubs such as the Hell’s Angels and other motorcycle clubs the world over. Typically, these types of rides have an element of card play, in the sense that each rider gets a playing card at each stop, and then at the ride’s destination, the riders with the best hands win prizes. The prizes are usually corporate-sponsored by an energy drink or a Vodka company, angling for a bit of fun advertising.
Organized first by the Aussie rider Stewie Mclean – and now carried on by Rabi Thapa and his team from Sacred Summits, a tour company, Nepal’s version of the Poker Run has become something truly special within our riding culture.
Our runs are sponsored by the likes of Yeti Airlines, Nepal Ice, and dozens of other well-known hotels and restaurants; even the Nepal Tourism Board has helped in making the ride grow each year – with this year’s event expected to see over 200 riders, many of whom have traveled all the way from India (and even further abroad) to attend.
But what is not so well-known about Nepal’s Poker Run is how it was first a dream in the mind of one of Nepal’s roughest riders, a true Nepali adventurer and explorer: Binod Chhetri Acharya (26 November 1976 -13 September 2008).
I first met Binod in 2003 or so, having just returned from Sikkim on a solo ride, where I had carried my motay frame plus bags on a tiny 125cc Yamaha. He too was a huge motay guy, and when he saw me and all my stuff on that little bike (overheating and ready to die from exhaustion), he just laughed and screamed “Jigeeeee!”

So it was Binod who introduced me to the Royal Enfield, and helped me purchase a 2004 Bullet with 350cc of much-needed power. For that (and his steadfast and supportive friendship), I am eternally grateful.
In the years leading up to his unexpected demise in 2008, Binod showed me a Nepal – and a Tibet – rarely seen by a foreigner, as he would take me to the craziest places on earth one could go on a two-wheeler: roads that were nothing but rivers, yak trails that even yaks dared to tread, sleazy-looking truck stops with the best dal bhat, and many other insane places not mentioned on any map.
In short, he was one hard-riding sun of a gun.
Yet there was an underlying beauty to this scar-faced man who would have made any Bollywood villain tremble; he was gentle but tough with me, a newbie rider, and he had a fierce desire to see Nepal improve, and come into its own on the international scene. He had a love of the open road that rivaled my own.
It was his dream to see the biker club (the Himalayan Enfielders) he helped start grow into an international association with riders from all over the globe. He also wanted to see a club house with a big welcome mat out front for all these riders –welcoming both locals and those from abroad.
He was a true hospitality entrepreneur, and a visionary that loved thumping down the highways at break-neck speed.
He is sorely missed by all that knew him.
But the point of my reminiscing is to point out his achievements, and that his dream is becoming a reality, in the sense that the Poker Run has become a successful event, with tour companies like Sacred Summits now inviting the international riding crowd to explore Nepal, India, Bhutan, Sikkim, and beyond.
With the help of Binod’s many friends, there are now biker bars here in Kathmandu as well as in Pokhara, acting as a hub for fellow bikers who enjoy the thrill of the open road on two wheels.
***
As part of the “pay it forward” aspect of every Enfield Rendezvous & Poker Run, this year there will be a donation of books, sports equipment, and other learning aids gathered for the needy children of the Siddha Higher Secondary School of Phale Patan, Pokhara.
There is nothing like seeing the faces of these kids as hundreds of thundering Enfields thump into their playground, transporting gifts like biker-bound Santa Clauses. This is one of the top highlights of each and every run. Needless to say, Nepali biker clubs are not what you would expect, and nothing like the Hell’s Angels of the yesteryears. They were notorious for their sex-drugs- rock n roll behavior on the road.
Instead, the Nepali version of a biker club is much more tame and humane. For example, my first ride with the Himalayan Enfielders back in 2004 was a day’s outing to the memorial established for those that died when PIA Flight 268 crashed into the hills near Lele.
Instead of a ruckus party full of nakedness on the back of a bike, the scene that day was more like a family picnic on wheels. Folk guitar, singing and snacks just about summed it up – along with the beautiful landscape of Nepal both there and beyond.
The Poker Runs are a bit wilder than that, falling on Nepali New Year’s eve and all, and while drinking and driving is discouraged, there is plenty of free beer and vodka once we reach Pokhara when all the bikes are put away. There is always a live band and plenty of crazy dancing, and the last time I attended, they just about closed down Lakeside as we rode in, welcoming each rider with a khada.
In short, it’s very sweet.
A few final notes on this year’s Poker Run: the ride is not just for boys on Royal Enfield toys (although it kinda started out that way), but instead, all are welcome. Anything that rolls is okay as far as transportation goes, and women riders are encouraged to join.
In fact, it seems everyone is welcome in this quintessential celebration of Nepal’s natural wonders. For example, this year I’m driving a car, just because I want to take my 40kg German shepherd dog, as he is way too big to fit on my bike.
Jigs Gaton is a quirky kinda-American retiree, happily living in Dhobighat with family, friends and pets, and whose greatest love outside of that is being able to ride around the countryside of Nepal, free as the wind.

Finding faith: Swargadwari in pictures,"Wednesday, March 30, 2016","In the western Nepal lies Swargadwari. The pilgrimage site located in Pyuthan District is believed to have once been the gateway to heaven. But the allure of the place is not just limited to those who call themselves religious.

Swargadwari has a distinct appeal to it that comes from the region’s abundant untouched beauty and its recognition. There is a serenity that the place exudes that comes from its isolation. But it may be more so because even the most ardent of non-believers would find faith here, even if its just an iota of it.
The seductive calm of the region is only broken by  the occasional clanging of bells and the chanting of mantras by priests at the temple complex.
Wherever you are at Swargadwari, you will be above the clouds. Only the peaks to the north and hills tall enough to break the barrier made by the clouds can be seen from the region.  This detachment from the world below gives you an intimate way to see the Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and the Manaslu.
The 120-year-old temple complex draws thousands of devotees every year. The temple houses elaborate statues of Lord Ganesh, Vishnu and Shiva. It also houses the eternal flame in front of which animals are sacrificed and religious text read.


To reach Swargadwari, you will have to fly to Nepalgunj first. From Nepalgunj catch one of the many buses that go to Rolpa and get off at Pyuthan’s Bhingri. After a hike of five hours you will find cars for hire to get to the temple complex.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/finding-faith-swargadwari-pictures.html,travel
Sindhupalchowk & Beyond: In 7 Photos,"Monday, March 21, 2016","Beyond the familiarity of Nagarkot and Dolalghat, further beyond the beaten path to Kodari lies the districts of Sindhupalchowk, Dolakha and Sindhuli. Oddly familiar but stunningly beautiful, this region houses some of the most well kept secrets of the country.

Kharidhunga (3000m) is located at Jethal village in Sindhupalchowk district. The town is covered with thick blanket of snow during winters and is located at the border of Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk district.
Regardless of the season, film units capturing the region’s wild beauty in camera is a common sight here. The region’s accessibility from Kathmandu and its proximity to Gaurishankar himal makes the place a near perfect backdrop for not only filmmakers but also those adventurous enough to venture out of Lakuribhanjyang and Dolalghat.

The town is mostly traversed by domestic tourists looking for a short respite from their daily lives. The meandering roads of the Lamosangu – Ramechhap highway that cuts through this region also welcomes thrill seekers always eager to take their bikes for a spin.

In the west of Kharidhunga lies a pristine lake that seems to be quaintly spreading in all directions. Its calm waters covers an area of almost 2-3 bigha and houses a temple at its centre. Boats are also available to rent.

Several hours away from Kharidhunga in Dolakha district lies Kuri, a small valley perched within hillocks that serve as the perfect vantage points. From sunset and sunrise in its east and west end the hills surrounding the valley is also impossibly near the mountain range in the north.
Over the years, the valley has grown into a small tourist town with 10-15 tea houses for food and accommodation. The town also sells artisanal cheeses that is exclusive to the region. The teahouses also sell Padamchal (Rheum Emodi) tea, a herb-based tea believed to lower blood pressure.

A short hike away from the town lies the temple of Kalinchok (4000m). This temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess of Kali, stands at the top of the hill at the valley’s northwest end and stands firmly in the midst of eerie silence that is only perturbed by the occasional wind passing through the area.
The hike to the temple complex will cover a stretch of 5 km.

Further way from Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha district lies Sindhuli. This bridge is located at Mulkharka, on the way to Dolakha from Sindhupalchowk. The settlement across the bridge is Mulkot. Further away from the bridge, lies the distinct pattern of BP highway which cuts through and drops deep from the hills of the area.

At Sindhuligadi, the highway cuts an even more distinct pattern as it passes through the region. Crisscrossing an entire hill at certain portions, the BP highway makes for an amusing sight.

"Here’s how you can escape Kathmandu, without leaving it!","Tuesday, March 15, 2016","A short trip to the peripheries of Kathmandu will give you a much-needed respite from your demanding 9 to 5 routine without making you of think (we know you are already exhausted) of an believable excuse to gather enough time off for a vacation.
Not only can these mini-vacations be taken in one of the weekends, they are also worthwhile escapes taking you to a different world altogether, far away from emails and appointments. Just remember to switch your phones off.
Before you reach Dakshinkali temple, a graveled road going uphill will take to you the Hatiban resort. From here, you will find the hiking route to Chandragiri, a destination preferred by those short on time but wanting a complete respite from the chaotic valley below, nonetheless.

Rolling vistas of the hills bordering the Kathmandu valley can be seen from the resort area itself but push yourself. The hike ahead can be treacherous for the desk dwellers but the experience of literally having left the city far below with every inch you move can be therapeutic, especially if you haven’t left Kathmandu for a long time.

After pushing your vertical limits, rest for a while at the countless rest spots and take in the cool breeze. Once you reach at the top of Chandragiri, you will be greeted by countless peaks hidden to those below in the city.

The Annapurna range along with Machhapuchhre can be clearly visible in a good day from here. If you are lucky, you will get to see Mt. Everest in the northeast along with other peaks like Mansalu, Langtang, Ganesh and Lakpa Dorje.



The hiking route from Hatiban resort will take you to Chandragiri via Champadevi and Bhasmashur. It will further take you to Deurali, Bhaleshwor and Chitlang Bhanjyang before ending at Thankot.
Those with enough time or excuses can extend the trip to Chitlang in Makwanpur after reaching Chandragiri. Here, you can boat in the sprawling waters of Kulekhani’s Indra Sarovar.

The Outllook Inn at 1650m offers comfy rooms with great views. On your way back, stay at Hatiban resort; they have good rooms with great service at reasonable price.

Stock up on cereal bars, snacks and water. There are only a few standalone shops on the route. Other essentials to pack are sunscreen, windcheater or raincoat depending on the season and a comfy pair of trekking boots.
A relatively untapped destination near the valley is Dalchoki. Forget the touristy Nagarkot and Phulchoki; this village in the middle of Lalitpur district is equally (if not, more) beautiful and accessible.

Like Nagarkot, Dalchoki is reached via meandering roads bordered by rolling cliffs. Once you reach to the top, you will be greeted by families dotting the area, reveling in picnics during most afternoons. Most visitors can be seen savouring the village’s local brew accompanied by local chicken.

During daytime, the equipoised massifs bordering Tibet make for an awe-inspiring sight. At evenings, an equally beautiful sight comes alive from what initially seems like a cluster of bricks and people. The rolling valley of Kathmandu ahead pulsates with discernible energy before resting for the night.

Mustard flowers cover the entire villages of Bhotdanda, Mahabhir and Silinge nearby while in winter, rhododendron flowers bloom in impossible nooks of the villages’ hills.



Go past Lele via Satdobato and Chapagaun to Lokpath. Go further ahead and you will pass Malla Hotel, Birkhedhara and the seasonal road leading to Sano Bhainse. After you cross this road, the hill in front of you is Dalchoki.
It is suggested that you take your own vehicle for the trip. Although public busses can be hailed at Chapagaun, they are always stuffed with people and may cause delay to your itinerary. The road is smooth for one not black-topped.
Or you can hike to Dalchoki from Lele’s Tikabhairab through Bhaise. The hike will take you three hours or more to complete. Stock up on essentials like water and snacks and start early.
If you have more time at hand, plan a longer hike. This route will take you to the villages of Nallu, Bhardeu and Chuaghare before reaching Dalchoki. A different route to Dalchoki can also be planned from Tika Bhairab walking past the peripheries of Kotdanda, Bhatte danda and Tin pate bhanjyang.

Dalchoki has several homestay accommodation on offer like Timsina Community homestay where in most evenings spontaneous dance sessions happen. The owners will also put up a bonfire if you ask nicely.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/heres-can-go-escape-kathmandu-without-leaving.html,travel
At Lord Shiva’s abode: Kailash region in 5 photos,"Monday, March 7, 2016","In Hindu mythology, it’s widely believed that Kailash is the abode of Lord Shiva. It’s said that whoever takes a trip to Kailash is welcomed at the heavens after his death.
For those not on a pilgrimage, the trip still has plenty to offer. For one, the journey takes you through a myriad of landscapes, some of which are treacherous but are ultimately beautiful.

Simikot is the gateway to Kailash. This district headquarter of Humla is mainly accessed by air. After a half hour flight from Nepalgunj, you will reach Simikot from which the Kailash region is three days hike away.

Those not keen on religion can take a detour to Limi valley. A six day trek will take you to this region where local, through routine life, put up a fascinating display of culture.

Other routes to the region will take to you Lapcha Syar via Hilsa or alternately via Nyalo Pass (4950m). Be liberal with your time; this trek will take almost three weeks to complete.

For those on the trail to Kailash, it is worth noting that the trek will take to the other side of the border to Tibet. The unpredictability on the side of the Chinese authorities, in granting visas to tourists on their part, could make the trip unsuccessful. If that is the case, visitors can go to Lapcha Syar in Humla to see Kailash from the Nepal side.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/lord-shivas-abode-kailash-region-5-photos.html,travel

“Have you been to Pokhara?
“Of course I have ! I love Lakeside! I para-glided while I was there!”
So goes almost every conversation when you ask someone about their visit to Pokhara. When you decide that you are going to pack your bags, hop on a bus and set your foot on the Pokhreli soil, almost every time, it’s the usual spots that you’re going to take a stroll in.
But have you ever wandered the Lake City in the shoes of a Pokhreli? Although, I am sure that you won’t exactly fit in our shoes (Pokhrelis are one-of-a-kind, you see), it doesn’t hurt to try. And being a quasi-Pokhreli on your trip here can be absolutely memorable.
You have not been to Pokhara if you haven’t bargained for a pretty dress or a Levis knock-off in one of the hundreds of shops in all shapes and sizes there.
And the stylish population of Pokhara you’ll see here is immaculate. Chatty girls hand-in-hand walking the sidewalks like runway models is a common sight.
Yet don’t be taken aback by them, these young Pokhrelis are humorous and they know how to get things done. They are natural bargainers and you’ll catch them picking a fight over a kilogram of apples.
There are a few malls in the city these days but few years ago, at the same spots, there was a labyrinth of shutter-shops that would roll open at 10 in the morning where every fashionwear would be on display.
Things are still the same, just with a mall or two in between. And when you’re done buying 10 items for 5 grands (if you know the art of bargaining, that is) you can slide into one of those many gallis that begin between the shops.
These gallis are home to many restaurants that provides mouth-watering momos, beautifully fried sausages and potato sticks. You won’t need any dinner after your feast in there!
Then comes lakeside. Of course, you’ve been there.

You loved lakeside, loved the Phewa and the Barahi temple standing so quaintly amidst it all. You adored all the pubs and bars that turn into a live gig every night, the hotels that come in every possible shape and size there is. You loved them all.
What more is there to love?
For once, don’t boat. Just walk along the banks of the lake, take it all in. Maybe stop at those little hut cafes for a coffee. They have eccentric, funny owners who will play the Beatles and the Doors on the stereo. It’s refreshing and over all, joyous.
If you don’t mind getting lost then try to explore the areas nearby lakeside. A few minutes away from Hallanchowk, past Khahare, there’s a place overlooking the Phewa that resembles a beach.
Another place nearlakeside is Birauta that is home to the very popular “Puime” restaurant. This place serves the best burgers in town; almost every Pokhreli know this. Birauta and Mustang Chowk (both around lakeside) are also home to restaurants that make the best “jheer” around Pokhara.
There are a dozen more places worth going to. The Gorkha village is where one can have a mini-hike or maybe watch, or even play, a game of golf. The beautiful Sarangkot has been providing visitors with a spectacular view of the valley in a breathtaking way since forever. And if you make it there early, you can watch the sunrise.
The World Peace Pagoda is another place which also provides a beautiful view of the valley and the Phewa. And for a change, try to swim (only if you know how to,and always have those safety jackets on) in the lake. Take a boat or a kayak with friends and get in the water-the ones who’ve done it know how nice it feels.
And then there’s the working Pokhreli population, the vendors on the streets, the herds of dokos carried by kind faced women-they are the epitome of what being a Pokhreli means. They represent the earthiness, the humility, and the humour that most Pokhrelis are gifted with.
As much as the beauty makes Pokhara what it is, it wouldn’t be anything if it weren’t for the people who live here. I believe Pokhara is made up of the beautiful people – that lady who sells vegetables on the sidewalks everyday, the little kids who wait at stops with their mothers holding their hands, the ladies who sell souvenirs on the streets of lakeside. These are the people that make this place.

So the next time you’re in Pokhara, practice kindness, be patient and always be ready with warm hearts.
Talk to the locals, they are always easy going, and will help you with directions. Take the bus. It is cheap, packed full of ethnicities and goes to every nook and corner of the city. Or maybe rent a bicycle and ride around.
It’s Pokhara. Go bonkers and have the time of your life.
Gurung is based in Pokhara.

In 6 photos: Resplendent Lalitpur,"Tuesday, March 1, 2016","The cultural and historical significance of Lalitpur – one of the three cities of the Kathmandu valley – sums up most of its appeal to tourists. But far beyond the ancient town’s intricate gallis and imposing courtyards and palaces lie its villages.

Some perched precariously on cliffs and hillocks, while others rested comfortably on flatland, Lalitpur’s villages are located only few hours from the city, but they are a completely different world altogether.

In the west of the district lies Malta, a township on the banks of the Bagmati. The villages of Mani Khel and Dhukuchap are located nearby. From Dhukuchap, one can see the Bagmati in its true form, far off from the tampering it goes through in Kathmandu.

Further away in the middle of the district, at around 23 km from the city centre of Patan, you will be greeted by farmers from their fields in Nallu, Lele phat and Dalchoki.

Down south from Sankhu lies Bhukhel. The village’s beautiful houses have immense appeal to anyone interested in rural living. Likewise, the remote villages of Kaleshwor, northeast from Bhukhel, Bhardev, northwest form Kaleshwor and Bhattedanda, which lies between Malta and Sankhu, all have charming settlements.

From Jhyalungtar as a vantage point, one can see the gleaming peaks in the north. Likewise, Ganesh himal can be seen from Lele Lepse and Manaslu from Chhampi.

As varied as the appeal of these villages are in their geography, culture and lifestyle, one thing is for sure; all these villages have immense potential for tourism. With stunning panorama of the peaks northwardly and the symbiotic nature of the relation its residents have with these villages, a hike to one of these places can be a truly engaging experience.

In 6 photos: Cycling through the Annapurna region,"Monday, February 29, 2016","Few trips in the world compare to cycling in the Annapurna region. The stunning drama of the region’s landscape is only matched by the impossibly treacherous ride cycling trough it entails. A word of caution: this ride is only suitable for the most seasoned riders.
The 14 day journey will start from Besisahar. Teeming with urbanisation, which may seem unwelcoming to the visitors, the town serves as the district headquarter of Lamjung. Luckily, you can choose to ride to Bulbule on the very day you arrive to Besisahar from Kathmandu. The 10 km stretch will ready you for more treacherous ride in the days to follow.
A 21 km stretch from Bulbule to Jagat will be covered the following day. Or, you can ride directly to Dharapani which is 25 km away from Bulbule.
The arrival of motor-able roads to this region has not deterred trekking enthusiasts. Once only accessible on foot the roads have, instead, given visitors other ways to explore this world-renowned region. Chame, the next stop, is a lung-busting 38 km ride away from Dharapani. Expect to slow down once in a while to give way to traffic, however thin it maybe.
After a day of rest in Manang, the next stop will be Yak Kharka. At 4,400m Thorang Phedi will be the next stop. All caveats of high altitude applies here so proceed with caution.
Muktinath will be the next stop in your journey. By now, on the tenth day, your body will have become accustomed to high altitude and the added physical activity.

By the time you will reach Tatopani via Jomsom and Kalopani on the thirteenth day, you will have traversed nearly 200 km of stretch that passes through waterfalls, steep hills, quaint settlements and lonely landscapes.
You will reach Pokhara from Tatopani via Beni the next day.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/6-photos-cycling-annapurna-region.html,travel
Etched on my mind: Five photos from Parbat,"Monday, February 15, 2016","In his recent trip to Arthar Dandakharka, Chitre, Bhanjyang and the Panchase peak, this scribe found quite a number of unique features that have the potential to attract footloose souls to Parbat. Here are some of them:
This is characteristic of every other Nepali village. In villages like Chitre, Arthar Dandakharka, Bhanjyang and other parts, youth are hard to find these days. They have either shifted to Pokhara or have gone abroad in search of jobs. Thanks to this drain, you find mostly elders in the villages. Mind you, Parbat is a district flush with remittance that its youth send from abroad. With most of the males abroad, women have to look after children and elderly members of their families, work the fields, and attend occasional meetings. That’s asking for too much from them, isn’t it?

During his trek to Panchase from Chitre and walks around Arthar Dandakharka, yours truly found the paths well-paved and well-maintained. Some of the paths were wide enough to double as motorable roads.  This is quite typical of a Gurung settlement, I guess. During a trek to Nakati Pakha – In Gurung dialect, it means the place where wild fowls come to feed themselves — from Chitre, a path bifurcated into two. Upon inquiry, Rebecca Gurung, field support associate, Ecosystem based Adaptation in Mountain Ecosystems in Nepal, a less steep path is for cattle, while the other one is for human beings. Apparently, a path with high gradient, a path that makes you climb up and climb down, is not suitable for cattle. You don’t have to be cattle to understand this much!

Here, they are a bit different, compared, at least to many other districts in the West. Like in other districts in the Western Region, houses are made of mud, stone and they have winged roofs made of slates and supported by a framework made of locally available timber. In Kathmandu and districts like Gulmi and Palpa, such houses have small windows facing the east and the west. This scribe found this feature absent in houses in Parbat. This design, I guess, is intended to shield the houses from cold wind blowing from Himalayas like Machhapuchhre, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and the Nilgiri. From the courtyard of a household, you can have an eyecatching view of the Himalayas like Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Nilgiri and Annapurna. What more can you ask for in this life?

These facilities are up and coming. But the income from these facilities cannot sustain these people throughout the year. With most of the youths out of the villages, elders have to put in extra efforts to run these facilities. Apart from these businesses, these people also have to engage in farm works to live comfortably.
Thought all cable cars in Nepal operate between the Manakamana Temple and back to Kurintar?  You could not be more wrong. In fact, a cable car service connects the people of Parbat and Baglung, a district known for bridges located at dizzyingly high altitudes. A total of 400 local shareholders built this by investing Rs 40 million. This bridge has cut short the journey, that would require about 1.5 hour of legwork, drastically. Get airborne for four minutes (caution: do not look at the river below if you have a weak heart, though the operator told me there have been no deaths on the journey) and you reach the other end.
These and several other features have Parbat etched in my mind.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/etched-mind-five-photos-parbat.html,travel
These photos from Sauraha will make you want to leave everything and go there right now,"Saturday, February 13, 2016","With winter coming to a close with each passing day, it might be a good idea to visit Chitwan now.
Chitwan’s dense forests on the banks of the Rapti, and the animal sanctuary on either side of the river make for a worthwhile escape to Kathmandu’s nippy winters. From the river banks, you can see countless birds and animals in their natural habitat.
Elephant rides and safaris have become synonymous with Sauraha. But how about bathing elephants? Everyday tourists and locals alike spend time with the elephants bathing them on the Rapti.


Sauraha is home to the Tharus, who are rich in culture and tradition. The Tharus are friendly people who will welcome you as their guests.

Early morning, the alligators come out for a drink and then soak in the sun to while the day away. Around the same time, deer and the black buck leave the dense forest to graze the flatlands around the river banks. If you are patient enough, you will also see the occasional tiger near the river banks.

Apart from its wildlife and dense forests, Chitwan also has the culture of its natives – the Tharus – on display. The Tharu museum at Bachyauli houses many traditional items of cultural significance to the community. Most evenings, youths from the community host the tourists with traditional songs and dance.

Chitwan is not just about tigers, rhinos and elephants, it is rich in bird life also. So pack your binoculars and get ready to hit the jungle.

Who says Nepal does not have a beach? Yes it does. After a hectic day of jungle adventure, wind down with sips of your favourite drink and enjoy the view.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/in-sauraha-a-perfect-winter-getaway.html,travel
Road to liberation: Mustang’s allure in 5 photos,"Tuesday, February 9, 2016","The Mustang region has long mystified visitors with its remoteness and seemingly impossible landscapes that consist of desert-like areas, verdant forests and steep hills, all within the foot of towering peaks.
Jomsom is the gateway to the Muktinath region. It connects this once isolated region to Pokhara and beyond via air and road. A bus ride to Jomsom from Pokhara will take you through verdant forests and meandering roads which twist and cut through steep hills and arid plains.
With its cobbled street and stone houses, Jomsom has a quaint charm to it. The district headquarter of Mustang district, this town teems with activity during peak seasons. While there, do not forget to sample the local Thakali thali; this renowned platter is native to this region. Also made locally is apple whiskey. Made from apples grown at nearby Marpha, this fruity and fiery beverage will help you cut the cold.
For those who wish to trek to Muktinath, a 6-7 days itinerary can be followed which will take you, on foot, to places like Marpha, Ghansa and Kagbeni. The trek starts from Tatopani in Beni and will encompass sprawling villages and arid landscapes which evokes a sense of awe and desolation at once. Every year just before Dashain, relatives and kins gather to this village to pay homage to those who have passed away.
The village of Lete will be your first pitsop on the way to Muktinath if you wish to traverse the region on foot. This area is with covered with dense alpine forests and hillocks which adds character to the pillaring massifs which lie just beyond.
After the treacherous yet beautiful journey, whether by foot or vehicle, you will reach Muktinath. The temple lies on top of a hillock and sees pilgrims most time of the year. The temple is legendary in its religious significance, and finds place in sacred Hindu texts like the Vishnu Puran.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/road-liberation-mustangs-allure-five-photos.html,travel
Larjung: A place among geological giants,"Wednesday, February 3, 2016","Larjung offers an opportunity to get close, literally and metaphorically, to the natural wonders of the Annapurna region.
The mountains on either side of Larjung, in Thak Khola, seem to be inching closer to it, as if at any moment they might slam shut, cutting off Thak Khola from the rest of the world. You feel puny standing at the bottom of what is one of the deepest gorges in the world, and looking at one of the highest mountains in the world. The immensity of the landscape around you evokes a sense of reverence for nature.
Immediately behind Larjung, the Dhaulagiri Icefall is poised like an icy deluge arrested by its own viscosity. Behind it is the even more stupendous hulk of Dhaulagiri, the seventh-highest mountain. Flanking the village on the east is the wide, stony bed of the Kali Gandaki River. The southern horizon is almost dammed by a gigantic mountain face, appearing like an inclined open book. Look north and your eyes follow the narrow gorge, with the Kali Gandaki a sliver weaving sinuously through it, and the mind conjures images of the sequestered Upper Mustang.

Larjung is a threshold in many ways. It once was the southernmost point of the Guge Kingdom, which stretched from western Tibet to northern Ladakh in the tenth century. Besides being a former frontier, Larjung is also a a repository where culture and history remain even as they have been eroded mercilessly by the road in many places in Thak Khola. Near the eastern end of Larjung stands the ancient Makhi Lhakhang. It is the southernmost Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the Thak Khola. Barely twenty minutes north of Larjung is the village of Kobang. The traditional wooden houses there were torn down to make way for the road. It is a reminder of the price of development.
Although Larjung, too, has undergone significant changes, it has also retained much. Wood is still stacked neatly, as it is in many other Thakali villages, along the edge of roofs. Stocking wood is part tradition and part precaution against an abnormally severe winter. Another quaint feature of the houses is the notched tree trunks that serve as ladders. The ladders take you to rammed earth roofs, in itself a cultural heritage, since entire neighborhoods join in thumping the mud to harden it.

In a way, the salient features of Thak Khola, from its arid and mountainous terrain to its architecture to its unique history are represented in Larjung. Even the novelty that is the new road passes right through the village, a lifeline or an eyesore, whichever way you see it. As you see a vehicle go by in Larjung, it feels like a typical village beside a road, degrading into a characterless strip. You walk a hundred meters toward the river and the scenery makes you feel you are somewhere beyond the reach of the outside world.
A place like Larjung, since it has changed drastically (SUV horns ripping the silence where once the tinkle of mule trains would have chimed) is redolent of the past as well as a reminder of the unpleasant truth that change is the only constant.
But as you stand in the morning chill on the edge of the river, swirls of mist rising and thinning in the gorge, the mountains bathed in golden light, you notice the beauty of change. The mountains, forests, river and the village nestled in one corner are all in a place where there was once a sea.
Larjung is like a repository of relicts from different eras. One of these is the saligram, an ammonite fossil dating back to the Jurassic Age. For Hindus, it is more than a fossil; they revere it as a manifestation of Vishnu. The river bed along Larjung has plenty of these, but it requires luck and some dedication to find one.


Another attraction in Larjung is the caves on the cliff face near the Makhi Lhakhang temple. Although much smaller than the caves discovered in Upper Mustang, the caves in Larjung are no less intriguing.
There is also the Guru Sangpo Cave, believed to be one of the places where Padmasambhava meditated.
The Makhi Lhakhang is on the way to these caves. Kobang, a short walk north of Larjung, is also worth a visit.
A short hike to the summit of the hills across the river from Larjung yields a stunning view of Dhaulagiri and the surrounding peaks. The hills there are also rich in bird life. Idyllic meadows, sometimes with a lone horse grazing in it, are scattered on the edge of the river. An arduous but incomparably exhilarating trip can also be made from Larjung to the Dhaulagiri Icefall.



Trekking is the most popular way of getting to Larjung, whether you walk up to it from Nayapul (four to five days) or fly into Jomsom and then walk down via Marpha. You can also ride jeeps or buses up from Tatopani. There are numerous attractions on the trail to Larjung from Nayapul to make you forego the convenience and time-saving modes of planes and jeeps. These include the hot springs at Tatopani, the wondrous cascade that is Rupse Chhahara, the almost primeval-looking, tiny Titi Lake and the old trail that looks like it was carved – it was actually blasted – out of the cliff face and suspension bridges across dizzying chasms.
The newest option is to take to the road in a bus or your own motorbike or SUV. That mode of transportation is sure to make your hair stand on end. It will also get you to Larjung from Pokhara in a single day.

For its homely ambiance, the Larjung Lodge is hard to beat. More upscale accommodations are available at the Lodge Thasang Village.

It can be taken for granted that the meals, especially dal-bhat, are sumptuous in Thak Khola. So every lodge is worth a try. Larjung also has the usual repertoire of apple brandy, dried apples and apple pie that some people become addicted to while in Thak Khola.

Mustang’s notorious mid-morning winds call for a pair of sunglasses. Carry sunscreen to avoid getting a painful souvenir from the region’s intense sun.
Permits are required for trekking in the Annapurna Conservation Area. These are available in Kathmandu as well as in the ACAP office in Ghasa. But it always better to get it in Kathmandu, for you need to pay double (so it is said) if you get the permit in the offices inside the conservation area. Foreigners also require a Trekking Information Management System (TIMS) card, which can be had from the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) office and branches, Nepal Tourism Board office in Kathmandu, as well as in Pokhara.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/larjung-a-place-among-geological-giants.html,travel
Herd Haven: Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve,"Tuesday, February 2, 2016","Nepal’s westernmost protected area in the Terai offers visitors a chance to see what the west was like before malaria was quelled and jungles felled.
Standing on Shuklaphanta, the eponymous grassland after which the Wildlife Reserve in Kanchanpur district of west Nepal is named, you are surrounded by the hues of Nature: a wall of green sal trees all around, behind them the blue of the Churia Range, and the occasional white of calcified antlers that swamp deer have shed. In some corner, the dun patches of swamp deer herds lies.
There is colour even in the name of the grassland from which the reserve gets its name. Shuklaphanta, the largest grassland in the reserve, is a corruption of ‘Sukilaphanta,’ which means ‘white grassland.’ The name alludes to the colour that the grass heads turn to when they bloom.
But if the reserve were to be named after an animal, it would probably be called Barasingha Wildlife Reserve, after the Nepali word for swamp deer. They say that the reserve has the largest herd of swamp deer in the world, with some herds comprising of over 700 individual deer. The only thing more remarkable than this figure is the fact that only a decade or so ago a herd had double that number of deer.

The grasslands of the reserve are like smaller versions of the Savannah. Driving on these grassy carpets may not compare to a safari in Africa, but it’s special because Nepal’s other lowland national parks do not have grasslands as big as those of Shuklaphanta.
Shuklaphanta’s 305 square kilometers (plus a 243-square-kilometer buffer zone) boasts numerous types of habitats, most of which are still pristine. One example is the Rani Tal. Girdled by sal trees, the lake is a haven for birds and a treasure trove for birds and wildlife enthusiasts. You can watch whatever comes to this lake (what animal could resist such a sanctuary?) concealed comfortably (watch out for the red ants!) in a machan on the lake’s western end.
Shuklaphanta is exceptionally rich in biodiversity for a park of its size. The reserve has 43 species of mammals and 425 species of birds. Its rivers and streams have mugger crocodiles and smooth-coated otters, besides 27 species of fish, which include the golden mahaseer and rohu. Reptiles include golden monitor lizard, Indian python, and several species of cobras. The reserve also has a rare and intriguing resident, the hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus).

Beside wildlife, Shuklaphanta also has some interesting historical and cultural sites. Near Rani Tal, there are remains of a wall said to be that of an ancient fort belonging to a Tharu king. Old bricks are also found in another part of the reserve.
Shuklaphanta is one of the last remaining segments of the former vast wilderness that was Nepal’s western Terai. It is a sanctuary not only for Nepal’s many endangered wild animals but for the region’s past, a time when the west was truly wild. It helps you see what the early settlers from the hills were up against and inspires deep respect for the Tharus, for whom the wilderness was their backyard.



Over half a dozen buses leave daily from Kathmandu for Mahendranagar. The journey takes 15-18 hours. Tickets are available in Sundhara. There are also daily flights from Kathmandu to Dhangadhi. From Dhangadhi, it is an hour by road to Mahendranagar. Arrangements for transportation from the airport should be made in advance, as taxis are not always available at the airport. However, buses are available on the main road, which is two kilometers from the airport.
Public transport is almost non-existent on the road from Mahendranagar to the reserve’s entrance eight kilometers away. Hired jeeps are indispensable as jungle walks are not permitted .

In Hirapur Phanta, a grassland in the reserve’s northern side, a herd of blackbucks is making a comeback. In 2012, a small herd of blackbucks was brought from Nepalgunj and released on the 7.5 hectares of fenced-in grassland, as part of the Blackbuck Re-Introduction Program. The antelopes have flourished since then providing the visitors a wonderful opportunity to observe and photograph gorgeous animals at close quarters.
After spending time in the jungle and grasslands you can visit other interesting places around Mahendranagar. One place not to miss is the Dodhara Chandani Bridge, Nepal’s longest suspension bridge. The 1.6 kilometer long bridge, which spans the Mahakali River, is a couple of kilometers west of the reserve’s entry point in Majhgaon. The undulating design of the bridge forms a spectacular silhouette against the setting sun.
The rural areas around Mahendranagar have many Tharu villages. It is in them that indigenous culture is still making a stand. Everything in a Tharu home is connected to the world around them, which, originally, was the wild world. Water containers made from gourds and roofs and ropes made from wild grass reflect their gift of crafting household items from jungle resources. To get a feel of their traditional lifestyle and communal bonds, join them when they go fishing in groups. Savor their pace of life by riding in a bullock-cart.

For a feel of staying near the wilderness, try Shuklaphanta Jungle Cottage (099-524693/9848994693) or Suklaphanta Wildlife Camp (01-4355609/9851003677). The other option is to return to hotels in Mahendranagar. In terms of amenities, Hotel Sweet Dream (099-522313), Opera Hotel (099-522101), and Hotel New Anand (099-521693) are Mahendranagar’s best hotels.

Mahendranagar does not have many restaurants. Galli No. 3 has a couple, and there are several places outside the stadium (manch) near the main crossroads selling snacks like chowmein. The bazaar area has a number of dhaba-style eateries, most of them in Galli No. 4. The aforementioned hotels have decent menus, offering Nepali and Indian cuisines. The lassi at Bhatta Goras (Galli No. 5) is worth trying at least once and Guddu Sweet House in Galli No. 1 is the place to get mithai (dessert).

Heaven on Earth: Ghorepani-Poon Hill Trek,"Monday, February 1, 2016","For those who wish to trek through one of the most scenic routes in the world, a visit to the Annapurna region will have you traverse through dense forests and beautiful landscapes, with the pristine Himalayas never out of sight.
The highlight of the trek to the Annapurna region is Poon Hill, from where you can, on a clear day, view all peaks of the Annapurna range on a clear day. Surrounded by verdant forests on all sides, Poon Hill is a popular destination for local and foreign tourists alike. Especially famous as a short trek destination, Ghorepani-Poon Hill pulls is a crowd of up to 500 tourists everyday during the peak seasons.
This season though, Poon Hill hardly welcomed 40-50 visitors each day. The recent devastating earthquakes, the Indian blockade and the unrest in the Terai have affected this world-renowned destination of tourists.
The mountains still exude the same serenity, and are still calming and imposing. “The natural beauty has not changed, and the hotels are ready to serve the guests,” a local entrepreneur said on a recent visit, “But there are hardly any tourists.” Ghandruk, Ghorepani Poon Hill await visitors.



From the lake city of Pokhara, Nayapul is a few hours drive away. From Nayapul, you will reach the Poon Hill view tower via Landruk, Ghandruk and Ghorepani. Every stop on this route will offer stunning views of the Himalayas. This route is also the most accessible one in Nepal with a range of food and accommodation options on offer during the 3-4 days it takes to complete the trek.
It is not only for the view that you should traverse this route. Every route is unique in its own way and the culture of the region’s inhabitants–the Gurungs and the Magars–make this trek an experience unlike any other in the country. For the lovers of nature, the route mostly consists of charming villages which will be reached through dense forests and vegetation.

At 3,210m, Poon Hill’s viewpoint from which the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri range along with Nilgiri–a peak from Barhapeak, a collection of twelve peaks of the region–and Annapurna I (8,091m) can be seen. You can see the Annapurna South (7,219m) closer from Poon Hill than anywhere else. Apart from these, Hiunchuli and Machhapuchhre (6,993m) also make for a memorable experience.




Checklist
Getting There

From Kathmandu, you can reach Pokhara either by car, or on a bus or via air. Dhampus is roughly a couple of hours ride away from Pokhara on a four-wheel drive. Dhampus can also be reached on a public bus.From Dhampus, Landruk is roughly a day’s trek away. You can spend a day in Landruk from where Ghandruk is only 4 hours trek away.
The next day entails a lung-busting trek of 8 hours to Ghorepani for those in good health. For anyone not in shape, Deurali, on the way Ghorepani, has good options for accommodation. The viewpoint on Poon Hill is around 1.15  hours away from Ghorepani. Reach there at 4 in the morning to see sunrise. This is the highlight of the trek where you will see the mountains turning gold with the rising of the sun.
From Poon Hill, you can return to Ghorepani for lunch. Those with more time can choose to stay here while most will return to Pokhara via Birethanti from where transportation to Pokhara is available.
Other attractions

The village of Ghandruk, which is on the way to Poon Hill, is a Gurung village and holds the Gurung Museum where artifacts of the local culture are curated. Expect a memorable evening here. The locals always host guest with lavish staging of cultural dance routines. Also worth noting is that the village, separated from the national grid, hardly has any power outages with electricity generated from its own local hydropower projects.
Around April-March, the region is red-clad with rhododendron blooming in the wild.
Places to Stay

Since the village is frequented by tourists, the hotels and lodges have standardised tariffs. It’s only after you leave you realise what you have been missing all along–the immense sense of community of the villagers and the genuine hospitality bestowed by the women of the community. Most of the region’s charming houses have home-stay accommodation on provision.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/heaven-on-earth-ghorepani-poon-hill.html,travel
"Divining into the meanings of Hallan Chok, Arthar Dandakharka and Chitre","Monday, January 25, 2016","During a recent trip to parts of the Western region, yours truly got the opportunity to soak in the natural beauty of the region. While writing an account of the journey, yours truly may have forgotten to make mention of several places, not because they were not beautiful, but because he has a terribly short memory (That’s why he chose to write about the visit right after his return to Kathmandu).
Without wasting time — lest yours truly forget — let yours truly write about two beautiful places with bizarre names.
Who does not know about Pokhara? Yours truly is sure most travel buffs know more than he does about the Lake City.
 These buffs, yours truly is equally sure, also know about Hallan Chok, a tourist hub. But do they know how the place got its name? If you do, please keep quite. If you don’t, please read on.
 About 25 years ago, this place was not that famous, according to Lok Bahadur Gurung of Ghatchinda, Bhadaure-5. It was all cranberry shrubberies and paddy fields by the side of the Fewa, belonging to the rich Brahmins of the Pahadi caste. They tasked people from a certain downtrodden community with the utilisation of this place, according to Gurung. “These people would drink heavily and walk about, wander around desolate streets of this place (In Nepali, hallanu means to wander around, to shake).”
Then came a boom. With the restoration of multiparty democracy, Nepal opened up to the outside world, witnessing a surge in the number of tourist arrivals. Some of the Pahadi families, who were least bothered about their land, bought it back from those who were using it, while many landowners let the downtrodden ones one it. Some of the Pahadi families, who were least bothered about their land, bought it back from those who were using it, while many landowners let the downtrodden ones one it.
The change brought riches for the people from the downtrodden community. Through frequent interactions with tourists, they became fluent in foreign languages, especially English, got jobs in the tourism industry, many of them got married to foreigners, propagating foreign culture and habits, helping make Pokhara what it is today. Their drinking habit continues to this day, helping make the name of this place — Hallan Chok – still meaningful, even in the changed context.
Yours truly regrets not being able to keep pace with those shaking legs, for he had his fill in the highlands of Arthar Danda and Chitre.

Before setting foot on this highland known for its home stay facilities and eye-catching views of snow-clad peaks, yours truly had thought the place was Arthur Danda mis-spelt. But the name was alright, he found later, thanks to Gopal Bahadur Gurung (58), who has been involved in conservation of Panchase for long, the origin of the Harpan Khola, which drains into the Fewa in Pokhara.
The Gurung name for the place is Praythar, according to Gurung. In this tongue, Pray means eight and Thar means castes, literally meaning eight castes.
 These eight castes were Gurung, Brahmin, Thakali, Nepali, BK, Pariyar, Chhetri and Thakuri and Magar. Apparently, these people made the village self-sufficient as per a traditional system that assigned different roles to different castes at a time when industrialisation was not even in its infancy.
Times have changed and so have people’s ways. These days, people from these castes have migrated, mostly to Pokhara.   There are a few people in this beautiful village,  Raj Bahadur Gurung (51), who runs Pancha Koshi Home Stay with his wife Muna Gurung (46).  Together, these parents of three children also find time to tend their fields and look after their mother Tai Kumari Gurung (76). A former head constable of Nepal Police, Raj says his stress on offering local organic food to the guests.

It’s pretty cold in the panoramic village of Chitre, thanks to the wind blowing from the mountains. But warm hospitality, including a campfire, of local people lifts our spirits. I start a conversation with locals, wanting to know what the name means.

During the old days, according to the locals, this sleepy village had dwellings made of bamboos all around. The local dialect for these dwellings is Chitre. This is how Chitre got its name. Though there are no such dwellings these days, the place has stuck to its name and we the travellers have no problem with it.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wanderlust-diaries-divining-into-the-meanings-of-hallan-chok-arthar-dandakharka-and-chitre.html,travel
"Beyond words: Party life, rolling waters and majestic Himalayas","Wednesday, January 20, 2016","
As the New Year 2016 gets closer, Pokhara is out on the streets, partying. The festive season — Christmas, the Lhosar and the New Year — seems to have given a boost to the Lake City, whose mainstay of the economy — tourism — had seen not-so-encouraging times, what with the mega quakes and the blockade causing a decline in hotel bookings and more.
Pokhara itself did not suffer much damage during the April 25 and May 12 disasters, but as the whole country witnessed a decline in tourist arrivals, there was no question of Pokhara remaining immune to the slump.
The festive mood has given rise to hope that tourism will bounce back. It has also given the city another excuse to do what it is best at doing — party harder — and better.
Let’s hope that the New Year bringd more cheers to people of this beautiful city where you get to see majestic peaks like Annapurna, Machhapuchhre smiling from your hotel windows behind the outcrop of concrete buildings and lush green jungles. It is the sight to behold
Vignettes
As the headquarters of the western development region, Pokhara gives different districts a platform to promote themselves. For instance, at one stall at Gaurighat, on the banks of the Fewa, two young girls were performing a beautiful dance, beckoning people to visit Parbat, a district in the Dhaulagiri zone, highlighting its features such as a unique suspension bridge, the cable car connecting the district with neighbouring Baglung and its hydropower potential. The bridge is located at a vertical distance of 157 metres from the mean water level at the river. According to locals, who yours truly met during a recent journey to Parbat, this is the greatest vertical distance between the river and the bridge.
At the same platform, popular folk singer Badri Pangeni was scheduled to belt out popular numbers later on.
At the other venue pretty close, young artists were belting out popular English numbers and rocking Pokhara, much to the merriment of foreign tourists and local aficionados of foreign music.
Beautiful lights, tough ordeal
New Year can be a perfect opportunity to boat around Pokhara’s peaceful lakes, though it will be wiser to learn your swimming lessons and learn the basics of boating first, if you have not already. Boat owners provide you life jackets, but what if your boat overturned somehow and rescue got delayed? You can of course remain afloat but the cold gets you in the event of a delayed rescue. That’s no rescue at all, isn’t it?
These are the occasional thoughts that came to my mind while boating around the lake.
We somehow came to the shore, thanks to Komal Dulalji, who was on board with me — giving me the opportunity to capture the partying city’s lights and majestic Himalayas, while on board.
Dulalji, too, had his fears (Or maybe, just maybe, he was kidding). On the long journey in which the shore seemed to be nowhere near, Pushpaji had a question: What if the earthquake strikes? Neither I nor he had an answer.
Crocodiles were another of Dulalji’s fears, though I was pretty sure there were no crocs in these waters. Now about the detour, again: For about 20 minutes, we were following our friends on another boat closely. The detour began as we decided to make it to the Tal Barahi Temple.
With collective efforts to reach the shore not making much headway, I gave up boating. Thanks to Captain Dulalji’s navigation skills, we reached the shore half an hour later and I heaved a sigh of relief (Dulalji was calm and composed all through the ordeal. That’s the mark of a mariner, I guess.).
It was not the point from where we had begun our journey, but we had found land somehow. The captain wanted to reach the point of departure, but I was not taking any chances. So, we parked the boat, anchored it (Is it the right word? I know not, for it is uncharted waters for me), handed over the life jackets to the police rescue team at Gaurighat and, after watching the city in groove for about half an hour, returned to the hotel, tired to the bone.
In search of a story
Fewa always beckons me and so does the Tal Barahi Temple temple in the middle of it. The views of city lights from waters flowing in poetic waves melt my heart. Lush green jungles call me. Beautiful views of Himalayas draw me into this lake. And there’s no question of me not heeding this call.
During this trip to Pokhara and beyond, I had multiple assignments: One of them was writing and I ended up writing mostly about myself. Hope Pokhara forgives me for this, knowing full well that my feeble words cannot capture its boundless beauty.",https://english.onlinekhabar.com/blog-beyond-words-party-life-rolling-waters-majestic-himalayas-and-more.html,travel
Pasang Lhamu Sherpa: Nominee for #AdvofYear,"Monday, January 4, 2016","On May 17, 2007 Pasang Lhamu Sherpa set foot on the summit of Everest. Sherpa, who was on painkillers, took her last stride by lifting her right leg with her two hands.
The end of the climb was a moment that Sherpa could not believe had arrived so soon. Until a few years back, at her home in Solukhumbu, she had seen thousands of foreigners come to Lukla to climb mountains. It was there that the young Sherpa was bitten by the climbing bug.
Does her name sound familiar? Well, her namesake was the first Nepali woman to set foot on the summit (she achieved the feat on April 22, 1993, but could not make it out alive). The senior Pasang’s house is an hour’s walk from that of the junior. “‘Oh you are also Pasang Lhamu, you should also go climb mountains’,” my friends and family used to say,” remembers Pasang. “I had made up my mind. I would climb Everest one day. I didn’t know what climbing Everest meant. But I had to do it,” she remembers.
Fast forward a few years, Pasang completed her school from one of Sir Edmund Hillary’s schools, and came to Kathmandu for higher education. “Even when I was in Kathmandu, I had not forgotten my dream to climb Everest one day,” she says. To keep her thirst for mountain adventures alive, she helped mountaineering instructors manage expeditions during her Dashain break—that is when most of the climbing takes place in Nepal.
Living her dream was never going to be easy and she was aware of the obstacles. To top it off, she found out that climbing Everest requires lot of money and money comes only through sponsorship. As luck would have it, she received a scholarship to train in France. “Even while training in France, I found out that there were not many women involved in professional mountaineering,” she says. Within a few days in France, she had found her calling: to become the first female mountaineering instructor in Nepal. She had realized that although over two dozen Nepali women have climbed Everest, the number of professional women instructors was zero.

It is obvious that the physical capabilities of men and women are different. Only a woman instructor knows the problems a woman climber faces, and that is what makes the difference.
“It is obvious that the physical capabilities of men and women are different. Only a woman instructor knows the problems a woman climber faces, and that is what makes the difference,” she says. She adds that in a patriarchal society like Nepal, having a female instructor is especially important. “For example, if a dad wants to send his daughter to train, he would hesitate less if one of the instructors involved is a woman,” she explains. Going by her voice, one can easily say that she is talking from experience. During her early days, she would have to think twice before getting on a motorcycle. “After riding pillion, I would worry that someone might have seen me and told my folks at home.” This was not enough to stop her. It would take only a few months for her to turn pro.
On the fateful day, Pasang and her client were near Gorakhshep in the Everest region; their plan for that day was to go to Kalapatthar. “At around 12 pm, we heard a roar. It sounded as if the mountain had exploded.” As she looked out of the window of the eatery, she saw snow gushing down the slopes. In no time, the eatery was buried under snow. “We were lucky that it was just powder snow.” Pasang and other survivors of the avalanche huddled around, and launched rescue efforts in the area. Among the people they rescued were members of an Indian expedition headed for the Base Camp.
When Pasang came to Kathmandu, she found the city badly affected, and it was only then that he magnitude of the disaster sank in. The school where she studied and several other Hillary schools in the area were also hit. Along with her husband and friends, she started a campaign to provide relief to people affected by the quake, outside the capital.
“This whole year has been full of bad news for us Nepalis,” says Pasang, who wanted to do something positive for the country amid the gloom. Her nomination for National Geographic’s Adventurer of the Year 2016 has done just that.
So why did Pasang go to Everest on painkillers? Here is what she says,” I was doing rock climbing also at that time, and I had a minor accident. I was still recovering when the opportunity of a lifetime came. So I decided to go on painkillers.”
I was still recovering when the opportunity of a lifetime came. So I decided to go on painkillers.
“When I reached the summit, I took off my oxygen mask for 30 minutes to take photos. I could not believe my eyes. I pinched myself to make sure it was not a dream,” she says.
Will she attempt another Everest climb? “Well, my family members have said they won’t allow me to go on ‘dangerous’ climbs from now on.”
“Is Everest ‘dangerous’?”
She smiles.

Everest from up close: 17 days on roof of world,"Monday, December 28, 2015","Without the usual crowd of peak-season tourists and its logistics virtually unharmed, there are more reasons to visit the Everest region post earthquake.
With clear afternoons and balmy evenings, Nepal welcomes majority of its visitors in the months of September-November. The vicinity of Everest, with its hotels and charming teahouses should have been jam-packed with tourists now. But the number of tourists visiting the Everest region has declined sharply after the devastating earthquake and strikes in the Terai.
According to hotel owners of the region, the number of tourists this year is only around 25 percent of the corresponding figure for last year. But this world-famous region was never truly affected by the April-May quakes. In fact, its hotels and lodges are all decked-up to welcome visitors.

This year the number of tourists visiting the area is only around 25 percent of the corresponding figure for last year.
Few of those hotels which had been damaged have now been restored to their original form and the bridges and trekking routes around the region have all been declared safe. The region has been popular with backpackers and trekkers from within Nepal and all over the world for the scenic beauty it offers. This region is home to the world’s tallest peak Everest and other equally imposing peaks.
Mt Nuptse seen on the route
How to reach there?
Trekking duration around the region can span for weeks or can also be shortened according to one’s preferences. The shortest trek can be up to Syangboche. If you want to stretch your legs for a longer duration, the trek to Gokyo and Gokyo Ri is recommended. The longest trek will take you to Kalapathar and Everest base camp.

Namche
Lukla is the starting point of all treks to this region. While Lukla can be reached in a day from Kathmandu, it will take another day to reach Namche and a day more to reach Syangboche. In the fourth day, one can reach Moncho after which you can return to Kathmandu via Lukla which can further take two more days.
From Syangboche, one can trek via Dole and Marmecho to reach Gokyo. You will reach Gokyo on the sixth day of the trek, and on the seventh day, Gokyo Ri.
From Syangboche, one can trek via Dole and Marmecho to reach Gokyo. You will reach Gokyo on the sixth day of the trek, and on the seventh day, Gokyo Ri.
Situated at an altitude of 5,368 metres, Gokyo Ri offers a stunning panorama of the peaks of this region including Everest. You can return to Kathmandu from Gokyo Ri via Dole / Forche, Namche and then Lukla.
The 17-day trek
If you can afford to spend more time on this region, then a trek up to Kalapathar and Base camp can be quite an experience. The trek up to Kalapathar and Base camp is best experienced languidly. Make sure you have plenty of time to savour and reflect on the immense beauty on offer.
On the first day, a short plane ride will to take you to Lukla. If you reach Lukla on time, you can spend the night in Phakding, a small village around three hours away from Lukla. You will reach Namche on the second day, Syangboche on the third, Dole on the fourth, Marmecho on the fifth, Gokyo on the sixth and Gokyo Ri on the seventh.
On the eighth day, spend the night in Thaknaka. Cho La pass / Jongla awaits you on the ninth day. On the tenth day you will reach Lobuche after will you will finally reach Base camp via Gorakshep on the eleventh day.
At 5,384 metres from the sea level, Base camp offers the most intimate way to experience Everest without ascending it. If a little sense of adventure still remains, trek up to Kalapathar which is at even higher altitude than Base camp or you can return to Gorakshep to rest for the night.
On the twelfth day however, a trek to Kalapathar is mandatory to see the sun’s first rays reflected on Everest’s gleaming facade. This, sadly, also marks the end of the trek. On the same day, you will have to return to Gorakshep for lunch if you want to maintain your schedule and follow your itinerary. On the thirteenth day, you will reach Dingboche / Pheriche, Tengboche on the fourteenth, Namche on the fifteenth, Lulka on the sixteenth and Kathmandu on the seventeenth.
Accommodation for the 17 days which you will be spending in the region, comes in the form of charming teahouses, utilitarian lodges and indulgent hotels. Food is available on most of the routes. If all the rooms are already taken, which happens in most peak seasons, one can pitch a tent and while away the night.
If you are a foreigner, this 17 day trek will set you back by $1200-1800. Nepali trekkers can expect to spend a little less. The shorter, six day trek can halve the expenditure for those with limited budget.

The 17-day trek
If you can afford to spend more time on this region, then a trek up to Kalapathar and Base camp can be quite an experience. The trek up to Kalapathar and Base camp is best experienced languidly. Make sure you have plenty of time to savour and reflect on the immense beauty on offer.

On the twelfth day however, a trek to Kalapathar is mandatory to see the sun’s first rays reflected on Everest’s gleaming facade. This, sadly, also marks the end of the trek.

On the thirteenth day, you will reach Dingboche / Pheriche, Tengboche on the fourteenth, Namche on the fifteenth, Lulka on the sixteenth and Kathmandu on the seventeenth.

If all the rooms are already taken, which happens in most peak seasons, one can pitch a tent and while away the night.
If you are a foreigner, this 17 day trek will set you back by $1200-1800. Nepali trekkers can expect to spend a little less. The shorter, six day trek can halve the expenditure for those with limited budget.
